3035	We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale, nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation.
925	"The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on the concept of ""sensory substitution"" or ""perceptual supplementation"", we are developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults."
470	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of softening of the equation of state of matter at high densities and temperatures. We explore two possible explanations for this phenomenon: chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement. By analyzing data from experiments and simulations, we compare the predictions of these two theories and assess their validity. Our findings suggest that both mechanisms may contribute to the observed softening of the equation of state, but further research is needed to fully understand the underlying physical processes. These results have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in neutron stars and the early universe.
2060	This research paper explores the concept of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, focusing on the role of scalar gravitons in this phenomenon. The study is based on a theoretical model that proposes the existence of a scalar field that contributes to the acceleration of the Universe's expansion. The paper presents a detailed analysis of this model, including the derivation of equations and their solutions. The findings indicate that the scalar graviton field can indeed account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and the paper concludes that this model provides a promising avenue for further research in this area.
3167	The paper explores the concept of reference frames in special and general relativity, specifically in the context of freely falling frames. The authors argue that gravitational energy can be properly defined only in a freely falling frame, and not in an arbitrary reference frame. They also show that the energy-momentum tensor for a gravitational field in a freely falling frame can be derived from the stress-energy tensor of matter, and that this result has important implications for the interpretation of gravitational waves. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of understanding the role of reference frames in the study of gravity and spacetime.
1951	This research paper presents an inverse Monte-Carlo approach to determine effective lattice models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. The method involves generating a large number of gauge configurations using Monte-Carlo simulations, and then fitting them to an effective lattice model using a Bayesian analysis framework. The effective model parameters are optimized to reproduce the thermodynamic observables of the Yang-Mills theory, such as the energy density and pressure. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the inverse Monte-Carlo approach in determining accurate effective models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. This research has important implications for the development of effective models for non-perturbative studies of quantum chromodynamics.
550	This research paper investigates the presence and behavior of driven localized excitations in small nonlinear macroscopic and microscopic lattices in the acoustic spectrum. The study employs numerical simulations and analytical methods to analyze the dependence of the excitation properties on the nonlinearity and size of the lattice. The results reveal that the driven localized excitations have a unique dependence on the nonlinearity of the lattice and the frequency of the driving force, which suggests potential applications in energy harvesting and wave propagation control. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of considering the lattice size in the analysis of driven localized excitations. Overall, this study offers critical insights into the behavior of driven localized excitations in small nonlinear lattices and its potential applications.
951	"Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated. In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition. The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification."
1485	"The research paper titled ""Fermions in the pseudoparticle approach"" focuses on a theoretical approach to study fermions, which are particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. The pseudoparticle approach involves representing fermions as a system of non-interacting particles, called pseudoparticles, that interact with an external field. The paper discusses the mathematical framework of this approach and its application to various physical systems, including condensed matter physics and high-energy physics. The paper also presents important results and conclusions, such as the prediction of new phases of matter and the study of the behavior of fermions in strong magnetic fields. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of the pseudoparticle approach as a powerful tool to study the properties of fermions in various physical systems."
1285	The diagram algebra introduced by Brauer that describes the centralizer algebra on tensor products of the natural representation of an orthogonal group has a presentation by generators and relations that only depends on the graph of type An on n nodes. Here we describe an algebra depending on an arbitrary graph of type M. We study its structure when the type is An, Dn, E6, E7, E8. We determine the representations and find the dimensions. The algebra is generically semisimple and contains the group algebra of the Coxeter type M as a subalgebra. It is a ring homomorphism of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of these types. This fact will be used in later work determining the structure of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras of simply laced spherical type.
8	The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks, here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.
1227	We conducted extensive numerical experiments of equal mass three-body systems until they became disrupted. The system lifetimes, as a bound triple, and the Lyapunov times show a correlation similarto what has been earlier obtained for small bodies in the Solar System. Numerical integrations of several sets of differently randomised initial conditions produced the same relationship of the instability time and Lyapunov time. Marginal probability densities of the various times in the three-body experiments are also discussed. Our high accuracy numerical method for three-body orbit computations and Lyapunov time determinations is concisely described.
2629	"Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk. We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of the ""Central Limit Theorem"" useful to study large portfolio losses. Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis."
3251	Bivariate linear mixed models are useful when analyzing longitudinal data of two associated markers. In this paper, we present a bivariate linear mixed model including random effects or first-order auto-regressive process and independent measurement error for both markers. Codes and tricks to fit these models using SAS Proc MIXED are provided. Limitations of this program are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown. Despite some limitations, SAS Proc MIXED is a useful tool that may be easily extendable to multivariate response in longitudinal studies.
840	The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level, where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups. Our findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under tension.
721	We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson loops.
109	"We first present a simple proof that for any bipartite lattice at half filling the RKKY interaction is antiferromagnetic between impurities on opposite (i.e., A and B) sublattices and is ferromagnetic between impurities on the same sublattices. This result is valid on all length scales. We then focus on the honeycomb lattice and examine the theorem in the long distance limit by performing the low energy calculation using Dirac electrons. To find the universal (cutoff free) result we perform the calculation in smooth cutoff schemes, as we show that the calculation based on a sharp cutoff leads to wrong results. We also find the long distance behavior of the RKKY interaction between ""plaquette"" impurities in both coherent and incoherent regimes."
2003	The problem of joint universal source coding and modeling, treated in the context of lossless codes by Rissanen, was recently generalized to fixed-rate lossy coding of finitely parametrized continuous-alphabet i.i.d. sources. We extend these results to variable-rate lossy block coding of stationary ergodic sources and show that, for bounded metric distortion measures, any finitely parametrized family of stationary sources satisfying suitable mixing, smoothness and Vapnik-Chervonenkis learnability conditions admits universal schemes for joint lossy source coding and identification. We also give several explicit examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions.
2775	This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission (PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.
3038	This research paper proposes an opportunistic relay selection scheme with limited feedback in a cooperative communication system. The main objective is to improve the system's performance by selecting the most suitable relay node to forward the information. The proposed scheme utilizes a feedback mechanism that reduces the amount of feedback required from the source node, thus conserving resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant performance gains compared to conventional schemes, particularly in scenarios with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The study concludes that the proposed scheme is an effective solution for improving the performance of cooperative communication systems with limited feedback.
1063	The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321. This class contains the freely-braided permutations and the fully-commutative permutations. In this work, we show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative pattern classes can be transformed to give generating functions for the corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes. Moreover, this transformation of generating functions is rational. As a result, we obtain enumerative formulas for the pattern classes mentioned above as well as the corresponding hexagon-avoiding pattern classes where the hexagon-avoiding permutations are characterized by avoiding 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, and 56781234.
131	For the study of crystal formation and dynamics we introduce a simple two-dimensional monatomic model system with a parametrized interaction potential. We find in molecular dynamics simulations that a surprising variety of crystals, a decagonal and a dodecagonal quasicrystal are self-assembled. In the case of the quasicrystals the particles reorder by phason flips at elevated temperatures. During annealing the entropically stabilized decagonal quasicrystal undergoes a reversible phase transition at 65% of the melting temperature into an approximant, which is monitored by the rotation of the de Bruijn surface in hyperspace.
3476	We present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of single-layer graphene crystals examined under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The samples, with lateral dimensions on the micron scale, were prepared on a silicon dioxide surface by direct exfoliation of single crystal graphite. The single-layer films were identified using Raman spectroscopy. Topographic images of single-layer samples display the honeycomb structure expected for the full hexagonal symmetry of an isolated graphene monolayer. The absence of observable defects in the STM images is indicative of the high quality of these films. Crystals comprised of a few layers of graphene were also examined. They exhibited dramatically different STM topography, displaying the reduced three-fold symmetry characteristic of the surface of bulk graphite.
D2-38	The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS .
1705	This research paper investigates the connection between star-forming galaxies, AGN host galaxies, and early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The primary objective is to understand how these different types of galaxies are related and how their properties differ. The study uses a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data to analyze the galaxies' characteristics, including their stellar populations, morphology, and star formation rates. The results show that there is a significant correlation between the presence of active galactic nuclei and the properties of their host galaxies, such as their mass and morphology. Additionally, the study finds that early-type galaxies are generally less likely to have active star formation compared to star-forming and AGN host galaxies. These findings provide insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies and their different types.
1976	We demonstrate that the strong anomalies in the high frequency LO-phonon spectrum in cuprate superconductors can in principle be explained by the enhanced electronic polarizability associated with the self-organized one dimensionality of metallic stripes. Contrary to the current interpretation in terms of transversal stripe fluctuations, the anomaly should occur at momenta parallel to the stripes. The doping dependence of the anomaly is naturally explained, and we predict that the phonon line-width and the spread of the anomaly in the transverse momentum decrease with increasing temperature while high resolution measurements should reveal a characteristic substructure to the anomaly.
2719	This research paper investigates the performance of sparse estimators and their ability to achieve the oracle property, a desirable property in statistical estimation that ensures optimal performance. Specifically, we focus on the return of Hodges' estimator and compare its performance to other commonly used sparse estimators. Through theoretical analysis and simulation studies, we find that Hodges' estimator outperforms other sparse estimators in terms of achieving the oracle property, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our results suggest that Hodges' estimator should be considered as a viable option for sparse estimation problems.
2321	We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state, the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.
1080	The paper focuses on developing an iterative method for computing the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. The sign function is an important mathematical concept in physics and engineering, and it is used in various applications, including the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical potential. The authors of the paper propose a new iterative algorithm based on polynomial approximations to efficiently compute the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical potential and analyzing the results. The paper concludes that the proposed iterative method is a promising approach for efficiently computing the sign function of non-Hermitian matrices in various applications.
1547	This research paper aims to investigate the properties and behavior of directed relativistic blast waves, which are powerful and highly energetic phenomena that occur in astrophysical environments such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The study will focus on analyzing the dynamics of these blast waves, including their formation, propagation, and interaction with surrounding matter. The research will employ numerical simulations and theoretical analysis to explore the physical mechanisms that govern the behavior of directed relativistic blast waves, and to identify the key factors that influence their evolution and impact. The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of the nature of astrophysical explosions and their effects on the surrounding environment, and may have implications for the development of models and simulations of these phenomena.
3492	We present a new interatomic potential for water captured in a charge-transfer embedded atom method (EAM) framework. The potential accounts for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms as a function of the local chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of water.
3270	NodeTrix is a novel hybrid representation for analyzing social networks that combines the strengths of both node-link and matrix representations. In this paper, we present the design principles and implementation details of NodeTrix, and evaluate its effectiveness in various tasks such as detecting community structures, identifying influential nodes, and exploring network evolution. Our experiments show that NodeTrix provides a more effective and efficient approach for visualizing and analyzing social networks compared to traditional representations. Overall, NodeTrix has the potential to improve the understanding of complex network structures and facilitate decision-making in various domains.
3198	This research paper investigates the effects of a confining potential on anisotropic brane gravity. The study shows that the confining potential leads to a non-linear dependence of the gravitational field on the brane's tension, resulting in a modified Friedmann equation that predicts a modified expansion history of the universe. The research also highlights the emergence of a cosmic bounce scenario, where the universe contracts and then expands again. The critical outcome of this study is the possibility of explaining the observed cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. The results of this research have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of the universe and may offer new insights into the nature of gravity.
3723	We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
3812	This research paper presents a comprehensive study of the IC 348 nebula using data obtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed census of the young stellar population within the nebula, with a focus on identifying protostars and young stellar objects. The paper discusses the methodology used to analyze the Spitzer data, including the identification of infrared-excess sources, and provides a detailed analysis of the resulting protostar and young stellar object populations. The study also investigates the spatial distribution and properties of the identified sources, shedding light on the formation and evolution of the IC 348 nebula. Ultimately, this research contributes to our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of stars and planets in young stellar clusters.
1721	"This research paper titled ""Fundamentalist physics: why Dark Energy is bad for Astronomy"" argues that the concept of Dark Energy, a theoretical form of energy that explains the accelerating expansion of the universe, is problematic for astronomy. The authors contend that the existence of Dark Energy is based on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, which may not be a valid assumption. They further argue that the use of Dark Energy as a fundamental concept in physics limits our ability to explore alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. The paper concludes that the field of astronomy needs to be more open to alternative theories and perspectives to advance our understanding of the universe."
2799	A new public conveyance model applicable to buses and trains is proposed in this paper by using stochastic cellular automaton. We have found the optimal density of vehicles, at which the average velocity becomes maximum, significantly depends on the number of stops and passengers behavior of getting on a vehicle at stops. The efficiency of the hail-and-ride system is also discussed by comparing the different behavior of passengers. Moreover, we have found that a big cluster of vehicles is divided into small clusters, by incorporating information of the number of vehicles between successive stops.
3818	The classification of superpotentials is a crucial topic in the field of mathematical physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of different types of superpotentials and their properties. We begin by introducing the concept of superpotentials and their role in the study of supersymmetry. We then classify superpotentials based on their symmetries and show how this classification can be used to derive important results in quantum mechanics and string theory. Our analysis also highlights the critical outcomes of our study, including the discovery of new classes of superpotentials and their potential applications in various areas of physics. Overall, our research provides significant insights into the classification of superpotentials and offers new perspectives for future research in this field.
D2-71	Metabolic engineering is the field of biotechnology that involves the modification of an organism’s metabolic pathways to enhance the production of desired products, such as chemicals, fuels, pharmaceuticals, or food ingredients. By altering or optimizing the flow of metabolites within cells, metabolic engineers aim to improve the efficiency and yield of biochemical processes. This is done through techniques like gene editing, overexpression of enzymes, and the introduction of new pathways. Metabolic engineering has applications in industrial biotechnology, where it enables the production of biofuels, antibiotics, and biodegradable plastics, and is also crucial for improving processes in medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
1799	A spectroscopic method for staggered fermions based on thermodynamical considerations is proposed. The canonical partition functions corresponding to the different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit as polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the zero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is successfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched results are presented showing good agreement with that of standard spectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon and dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations are practically unreachable.
3407	The two-dimensional ionic Hubbard model is a theoretical model used to study the behavior of electrons in materials with both ionic and metallic properties. In this study, the focus was on the metallic phase of the model, which describes the behavior of electrons in a material with metallic properties. The researchers used computer simulations to explore the behavior of electrons in the metallic phase of the model and found that the behavior was highly dependent on the strength of the ionic interactions. They also found that the metallic phase could exhibit a variety of different behaviors, including superconductivity and magnetic ordering. The study provides important insights into the behavior of electrons in materials with both metallic and ionic properties, which could have important implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic properties.
1215	We study the effect of mass imbalance on the phase diagram of a two-component fermionic mixture with attractive interactions in optical lattices. Using static and dynamical mean-field theories, we show that the pure superfluid phase is stable for all couplings when the mass imbalance is smaller than a limiting value. For larger imbalance, phase separation between a superfluid and a charge-density wave takes place when the coupling exceeds a critical strength. The harmonic trap induces a spatial segregation of the two phases, with a rapid variation of the density at the boundary.
928	This research paper presents the results of a study that measures the absolute proper motions of H2O masers in the NGC 281 superbubble region, away from the galactic plane, using the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy (VERA) telescope. The study reveals that the masers are moving at high velocities, suggesting that they are expanding. The results also show that the masers are likely associated with a young stellar object, indicating ongoing star formation activity in the region. These findings contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of star formation and the structure of the Milky Way.
619	This research paper focuses on the effective tuning of exciton polarization splitting in coupled quantum dots. The study aims to investigate the impact of external parameters such as electric field and temperature on the exciton polarization splitting in coupled quantum dots. To achieve this objective, the research team developed a theoretical model based on the configuration-interaction approach. The results reveal that the exciton polarization splitting can be effectively tuned by adjusting the external parameters. The findings of this study have significant implications for the design and optimization of quantum dot-based devices for various applications such as optoelectronics and quantum information processing.
490	The research paper presents a model of late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) that simulates memory maintenance. The model focuses on the role of protein synthesis in the maintenance of L-LTP and how it can be disrupted by inhibitors. The simulation results suggest that protein synthesis is a critical factor in memory maintenance. The study also highlights the importance of L-LTP in the formation of long-term memory and provides insight into potential therapeutic targets for memory disorders. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of memory and the potential for developing effective treatments for memory-related disorders.
1537	This research paper explores the relationship between sofic quantum dynamical systems and computational complexity. The authors define sofic quantum dynamical systems as a mathematical framework that represents the evolution of quantum systems over time. They then investigate the computational power of these systems, demonstrating that certain types of sofic quantum dynamical systems exhibit equivalent computational power to classical computers. The authors conclude that these findings have implications for the study of quantum computing and the development of quantum algorithms. Specifically, they suggest that the study of sofic quantum dynamical systems may provide a useful framework for understanding the limitations of quantum computers and for developing more efficient quantum algorithms.
3608	In this talk I have raised the question of how the future discovery of leptonic CP violation can be made robust even at accepting the rather large current experimental uncertainties in our knowledges of neutrino propagation in matter. To make progress toward answering the difficult question, I listed ways to proceed: (1) Obtain tighter constraints on the MSW theory by testing it by various neutrino experiments. (2) Measure the matter effect in situ, namely within the experiment for discovering CP violation itself. (3) Uncover leptonic CP violation in a matter effect free environment. I also reported a step made toward the above point (2) by taking neutrino factory as a concrete setting; An accurate in situ measurement of the matter effect looks promising.
3807	We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).
367	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of effective attraction induced by repulsive interaction in a spin-transfer system. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this counterintuitive behavior arises due to the interplay between spin-transfer torque and interparticle repulsion. Our results reveal that this effect can be leveraged to manipulate the dynamics of spin-transfer systems, leading to novel applications in spintronics and magnetic data storage. This study highlights the importance of considering repulsive interactions in understanding the behavior of spin-transfer systems and provides a new avenue for controlling their dynamics.
1116	An eleven channel digital asynchronous transceiver (DAT) employing parallel optical link technology has been developed for trigger signal distribution across the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Combinatorial logic functions are implemented in Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGAs, providing a versatile solution adaptable for use in future atmospheric Cerenkov detectors and other high-energy astroparticle experiments. The device is dead-time free and introduces a minimal skew of 1.6 ns between channels. The jitter on each DAT channel is less than 0.8 ns 95% of the time, allowing communication between telescopes and a central trigger system separated by hundreds of meters, without limiting array performance.
665	A recent, major, puzzle in the core-level photoemission spectra of doped manganites is the observation of a 1-2 eV wide shoulder with intensity varying with temperature T as the square of the magnetization over a T scale of order 200K, an order of magnitude less than electronic energies. This is addressed and resolved here, by extending a recently proposed two electron fluid l-b model for these systems to include core-hole effects. The shoulder arises from a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the highly localized (l) and band-like (b) states. Furthermore, our theory leads to a correspondence between spectral changes due to increasing doping and decreasing T, as experimentally observed.
3144	We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.
615	"The research paper titled ""An Integrated Human-Computer System for Controlling Interstate Disputes"" proposes a system that combines human judgment and computer algorithms to facilitate the resolution of interstate disputes. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns, which are then presented to human judges who use their expertise to make informed decisions. The authors argue that this approach could help to reduce bias and increase the efficiency of dispute resolution. The paper concludes that the proposed integrated system has the potential to significantly improve the process of resolving interstate disputes, particularly those that involve complex data sets. However, the authors note that further research and development is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of this approach."
2936	We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems. We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal. We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to present.
3338	"The research paper titled ""Bimodality in spectator fragmentation"" investigates the phenomenon of bimodal fragmentation in high-energy particle collisions. The study focuses on the primary theme of identifying the sources and characteristics of this phenomenon and its impact on particle physics research. Through extensive simulations and data analysis, the researchers found that bimodality in spectator fragmentation is a robust and common feature of high-energy collisions. The study also highlights the potential of bimodality as a tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions and have important implications for ongoing research in particle physics."
2562	We have discovered a long radio trail at 843 MHz which is apparently associated with middle age pulsar PSR J1509-5850. The radio trail has a length of ~7 arcmin. In X-rays, Chandra observations of PSR J1509-5850 reveal an associated X-ray trail which extends in the same orientation as the radio trail. Moreover, two clumpy structures are observed along the radio trail. The larger one is proposed to be the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate MSC 319.9-0.7. Faint X-ray enhancement at the position of the SNR candidate is found in the Chandra data.
197	The authors apply three methods of prospective modelling to high resolution georeferenced land cover data in a Mediterranean mountain area: GIS approach, non linear parametric model and neuronal network. Land cover prediction to the latest known date is used to validate the models. In the frame of spatial-temporal dynamics in open systems results are encouraging and comparable. Correct prediction scores are about 73 %. The results analysis focuses on geographic location, land cover categories and parametric distance to reality of the residues. Crossing the three models show the high degree of convergence and a relative similitude of the results obtained by the two statistic approaches compared to the GIS supervised model. Steps under work are the application of the models to other test areas and the identification of respective advantages to develop an integrated model.
D1-8	Thalidomide is a drug that was first developed in the 1950s as a sedative and later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. However, it caused severe birth defects, including missing or malformed limbs, when taken during pregnancy. The tragedy affected thousands of babies and led to stricter drug regulations worldwide. Despite its harmful past, thalidomide was later found to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Today, it is used under strict controls to treat multiple myeloma, leprosy-related inflammation, and some autoimmune diseases. Due to its risks, it is only prescribed under a controlled program to prevent use during pregnancy. Its history remains a major lesson in pharmaceutical safety.
1211	The proof of the fact that there are no nontrivial, consistent cross-couplings that can be added between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field is accomplished by means of a cohomological approach, based on the deformation of the solution to the master equation from the antifield-Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. The procedure developed here relies on the assumptions of locality, smoothness, (background) Lorentz invariance, Poincare invariance, and preservation of the number of derivatives with respect to each field (the last hypothesis was made only in antighost number zero).
3220	The article discusses the use of the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows to probe the structure of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. The author explains that the steep decay phase is caused by the interaction between the GRB jet and its surrounding medium, which can provide valuable information about the jet's properties. By analyzing the steep decay phase, researchers can determine the jet's collimation angle, energy, and magnetic field strength. The article also highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations in studying GRBs, as they provide a more complete picture of the event. The author concludes that studying the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows is a promising approach to understanding the structure and properties of GRB jets.
956	We introduce a special class of pairwise-independent self-joinings for a stationary process: Those for which one coordinate is a continuous function of the two others. We investigate which properties on the process the existence of such a joining entails. In particular, we prove that if the process is aperiodic, then it has positive entropy. Our other results suggest that such pairwise independent, non-independent self-joinings exist only in very specific situations: Essentially when the process is a subshift of finite type topologically conjugate to a full-shift. This provides an argument in favor of the conjecture that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold-mixing.
2780	The exact formula for the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with constant density, which was discovered by Kimura, Takamura and Yokomakura, has been applied mostly to the standard case with three flavor neutrino so far. In this paper applications of their formula to more general cases are discussed. It is shown that this formalism can be generalized to various cases where the matter potential have off-diagonal components, and the two non-trivial examples are given: the case with magnetic moments and a magnetic field and the case with non-standard interactions. It is pointed out that their formalism can be applied also to the case in the long baseline limit with matter whose density varies adiabatically as in the case of solar neutrino.
3644	This research paper investigates the application of quantum mechanics to polymer systems and its continuum limit. The study demonstrates the potential of quantum mechanics in predicting the properties and behavior of polymer materials at the molecular level. The research also explores the continuum limit of polymer systems, which is an essential concept in modeling polymers at a larger scale. The results suggest that the continuum limit can provide useful insights into the behavior of polymer materials and help in developing new materials with desired properties. Overall, this study highlights the significance of the intersection of quantum mechanics and polymer science and its potential impact on materials research and development.
1241	For general quantum systems the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions in relation to the ergodic properties of the underlying classical system is quite difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way, thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set of quantum limits in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as quantum limits, and examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely continuous ergodic measures can occur as quantum limits. The maps we quantise are obtained by cutting and stacking.
1258	This research paper delves into the study of photoelectric phenomena in structures composed of high-resistivity semiconductor crystals that have a thin insulator layer at the boundary between the semiconductor and metal.

The study aims to provide insights into the fundamental principles governing the photoelectric effect in these structures and to explore their potential applications in various fields. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with the fabrication and characterization of these structures and offers suggestions for future research in this area.
930	"The research paper ""Vocabulary growth in collaborative tagging systems"" examines how collaborative tagging systems contribute to the growth of vocabulary. The study analyzed a dataset of tags from Delicious, a social bookmarking platform, and found that new tags were more likely to be created by low-frequency taggers and that the vocabulary growth rate was higher in the early stages of the system's development. The study also found that the use of synonym tags decreased over time, indicating that users were converging on a shared vocabulary. The paper concludes that collaborative tagging systems are effective at facilitating vocabulary growth and can be a valuable resource for language learning and knowledge management."
52	This research paper presents a performance analysis for multichannel reception of Orthogonal Offset Frequency Shift Keying (OOFSK) signaling. The main theme of the study is to investigate the impact of the number of channels on the system's performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and throughput. The researchers conducted simulations using different numbers of channels and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The results show that increasing the number of channels improves the system's performance, particularly at low SNRs. However, the improvement in BER saturates beyond a certain number of channels. Furthermore, the study also reveals that increasing the number of channels may not necessarily lead to an increase in throughput. The research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of multichannel communication systems using OOFSK signaling.
3090	In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with the zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass of the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge couplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial deviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are suppressed by a factor \cos \theta_H from the values in the standard model, where \theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can be tested at LHC and ILC.
697	The manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising technique for a variety of applications ranging from laser cooling and trapping to coherent atom transport and matter wave interferometry. Optical fields have also been proposed as interesting tools for quantum information processing with cold atoms. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a cold 87Rb atomic cloud falling in the gravity field in the presence of two crossing dipole guides. The cloud is either deflected or split between the two branches of this guide. We explore the possibilities of optimization of this device and present preliminary results obtained in the case of zero-temperature dilute Bose-Einstein condensates.
2699	"The research paper titled ""Tiling models for metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants"" investigates the nature and behavior of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants using various tiling models.

It also demonstrates that the tiling models can provide insights into the structural and mechanical properties of the approximants, including the formation of shear bands and the deformation behavior under stress. The essential conclusion is that the tiling models are useful tools for understanding the complex nature of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants and can aid in the design of new materials with desired properties."
411	As information continues to proliferate on the Internet, individuals are faced with the challenge of effectively managing and preserving their personal digital archives. This research paper evaluates personal archiving strategies for Internet-based information, focusing on the effectiveness of various tools and techniques for capturing, organizing, and preserving digital content.

The results provide insights into the factors that influence the success of personal archiving, such as user motivation, technological capabilities, and risk assessment. The paper concludes with recommendations for individuals seeking to develop effective personal archiving strategies, as well as suggestions for future research in this area.

The paper provides an overview of the theoretical framework and mathematical models used to describe this phenomenon. The study also delves into the implications of Brane-world quantum gravity, including the potential for resolving the hierarchy problem and the prediction of extra dimensions that could be observed in experiments. The research concludes that Brane-world quantum gravity offers a promising avenue for further exploration and understanding of the fundamental nature of our universe.
3577	This research paper examines the optical variability of infrared power law-selected galaxies and X-ray sources in the GOODS-South Field. Using multi-epoch imaging data, we identify sources that show significant variability and study their properties. Our analysis reveals a diverse population of objects, including active galactic nuclei, star-forming galaxies, and transients. We find that optical variability is a useful tool for identifying and characterizing sources in the infrared and X-ray regimes. These results have important implications for our understanding of the physics of high-energy astrophysical sources and their evolution over time.

The main points covered include a review of the 3+1 formalism, a discussion on the different types of initial data, and a detailed explanation of the conformal transverse-traceless decomposition method. The paper also includes noteworthy findings, such as the importance of choosing suitable gauge conditions and the potential use of conformal techniques in constructing initial data for binary black hole simulations. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of accurate initial data in numerical relativity simulations and the potential impact on gravitational wave observations.
D2-14	Molecular data on relationships within angiosperms confirm the view that their increasing morphological diversity through the Cretaceous reflected their evolutionary radiation. Despite the early appearance of aquatics and groups with simple flowers, the record is consistent with inferences from molecular trees that the first angiosperms were woody plants with pinnately veined leaves, multiparted flowers, uniovulate ascidiate carpels, and columellar monosulcate pollen. Molecular data appear to refute the hypothesis based on morphology that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living relatives. Morphological analyses of living and fossil seed plants that assume molecular relationships identify glossopterids, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as angiosperm relatives; these results are consistent with proposed homologies between the cupule of glossopterids and Caytonia and the angiosperm bitegmic ovule.
1958	In this research paper, we present a groupoid approach to noncommutative T-duality, a fundamental concept in string theory. By introducing a new notion of groupoid action, we provide a unified framework that encompasses various noncommutative geometries. Our approach leads to a novel understanding of noncommutative T-duality and sheds light on its relation to the geometry of the target space. We also establish a concrete correspondence between certain noncommutative T-dual pairs. Our results suggest that groupoids provide a powerful tool for studying noncommutative geometry and its applications in theoretical physics.
2896	I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.
1339	We systematically evaluate the potential energy at the touching configuration for heavy-ion reactions using various potential models. We point out that the energy at the touching point, especially that estimated with the Krappe-Nix-Sierk (KNS) potential, strongly correlates with the threshold incident energy for steep fall-off of fusion cross sections observed recently for several systems at extremely low energies. This clearly indicates that the steep fall-off phenomenon can be attributed to the dynamics after the target and projectile touch with each other, e.g., the tunneling process and the nuclear saturation property in the overlap region.
666	The article discusses the unusual doping and temperature dependence of photoemission spectra from manganites, which are materials with interesting electronic and magnetic properties. The authors studied the photoemission spectra of manganites with different doping levels and temperatures and found that the spectra exhibited unexpected features.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of studying the electronic properties of complex materials to uncover new phenomena and potential applications.

Through observations of spectral lines, the ionization fraction of the cloud is estimated, and its impact on the formation of protostars and planets is explored. The results suggest that the ionization fraction plays a crucial role in the formation of these celestial bodies and may have significant implications for our understanding of the early stages of star and planet formation. The findings of this study have important implications for future research in astrophysics and planetary science.
3243	We introduce an approach to determining the required waveforms to coherently control the optical energy localization in plasmonic nanosystems. This approach is based on the impulsive localized excitation of the nanosystem and time reversal of the generated far-zone field at a single point with one polarization. Despite strong interaction and significant dephasing and dissipation in metal plasmonic systems, and incompleteness of this time reversal, the proposed approach proves to be very efficient in controlling the nanoscale optical fields. Possible applications include nanoscale spectroscopy and photomodification, ultradense memory, and information processing on the nanoscale.
3120	This research paper investigates the interactions, superconducting $T_c$, and fluctuation magnetization for two coupled quantum dots in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. The study shows that the coupling strength and the dot size have a significant impact on the superconducting $T_c$ and fluctuation magnetization. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of considering the interplay between quantum interference and Coulomb interactions in determining the properties of the system. Overall, the findings provide insights into the behavior of coupled quantum dots in the presence of superconductivity and magnetic fields.
39	This document reports on a series of experimental and theoretical studies conducted to assess the astro-particle physics potential of three future large-scale particle detectors proposed in Europe as next generation underground observatories. The proposed apparatus employ three different and, to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid Argon TPC), LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (\WC), based on the use of large mass of liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter instability, the detection of astrophysical- and geo-neutrinos and to the possible use of these detectors in future high-intensity neutrino beams.
3558	By using only combinatorial data on two posets X and Y, we construct a set of so-called formulas. A formula produces simultaneously, for any abelian category A, a functor between the categories of complexes of diagrams over X and Y with values in A. This functor induces a triangulated functor between the corresponding derived categories. This allows us to prove, for pairs X, Y of posets sharing certain common underlying combinatorial structure, that for any abelian category A, regardless of its nature, the categories of diagrams over X and Y with values in A are derived equivalent.
2082	We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive measure of azimuth structure.
D2-6	The active quest for extra-solar planets has opened a new chapter in the book of the search for extra-terrestrial life. This was already an active field of science with the exploration of the Solar System by means of space probes, which gave rise to a ‘space age’ from 1957 when Sputnik-1, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, was launched. Current technology allows us to land a robotic chemistry laboratory on other Solar System bodies, or return samples to Earth, the latter coming with the advantage of being able to adapt analysis strategies to unexpected findings. Based on our current understanding, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, if we consider life based on a liquid other than water, Titan are the most promising places.
1151	"The research paper titled ""Dual nature of improper ferroelectricity in a magnetoelectric multiferroic"" investigates the behavior of a material called BiFeO3, which exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic properties. The main focus of the study is to understand the relationship between these two properties and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications. The researchers found that the ferroelectric behavior in BiFeO3 is not purely intrinsic, but rather a result of a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. They also discovered that the magnetic behavior of the material can be controlled by an external electric field, opening up possibilities for new types of devices that combine magnetic and electric properties. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex behavior of multiferroic materials and their potential for technological applications."

The research concludes that the ERG method can be a powerful tool for studying quantum systems and provides a starting point for future research in this area.
3564	The non-Abelian feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results in the gluons losing more energy than quarks in the medium formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Experimental results in p+p collisions when compared to NLO pQCD calculations show that at high transverse momentum (pT) the produced protons+anti-protons are dominantly from gluon jets and charged pions have substantial contribution from quark jets. If such a scenario is applied to heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, one would expect the difference in quark and gluon energy loss to have an effect on measured observables, such as high pT pbar(p)/pi ratios and the nuclear modification factor for various particles species. We discuss the experimental results and some possible future measurements.
3086	A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. We present first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion path probability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result is then used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heat or entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the path uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.
1917	This research paper explores the application of a multi-agent approach to the self-organization of networks. Specifically, the paper examines how multiple agents can cooperate and adapt to create efficient and resilient network structures. The study uses a simulation model to test the effectiveness of the approach and analyzes the resulting network structures. The findings suggest that the multi-agent approach can lead to the creation of highly organized and robust networks. The paper concludes that this approach has great potential for improving network design and management in various domains.
416	This research paper investigates crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property. The Rokhlin property, a crucial concept in the theory of operator algebras, characterizes the existence of a certain type of projection in a crossed product. We analyze the conditions under which this property holds and provide examples of group actions that satisfy it. Our study yields significant consequences for the classification of operator algebras and the construction of non-commutative dynamical systems. In particular, we demonstrate that the Rokhlin property enables the decomposition of crossed products into simpler algebras, which facilitates their analysis and classification. Our findings contribute to the development of a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of operator algebras and have implications for various areas of mathematics and physics.
210	We report the first experimental demonstration of compensation of beam-beam interaction effects in high-energy particle collider by using space-charge forces of a low-energy electron beam. In our experiments, an electron lens, a novel instrument developed for the beam-beam compensation, was set on a 980-GeV proton bunch in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. The proton bunch losses due to its interaction with antiproton beam were reduced by a factor of 2 when the electron lens was operating. We describe the principle of electron lens operation and present experimental results.
3562	This paper explores a comparative study of both the linear and kernel implementations of three of the most popular Appearance-based Face Recognition projection classes, these being the methodologies of Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. The experimental procedure provides a platform of equal working conditions and examines the ten algorithms in the categories of expression, illumination, occlusion and temporal delay. The results are then evaluated based on a sequential combination of assessment tools that facilitate both intuitive and statistical decisiveness among the intra and interclass comparisons. The best categorical algorithms are then incorporated into a hybrid methodology, where the advantageous effects of fusion strategies are considered.
1320	This research paper explores the microscopic mechanism behind cold denaturation, the phenomenon where proteins lose their native structure and stability at low temperatures. Using computer simulations and theoretical models, the authors demonstrate that cold denaturation is caused by a decrease in protein solvation due to the formation of ice-like water structures around the protein. They also propose a new model for predicting the temperature at which cold denaturation occurs based on protein size and shape. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the physical principles that govern protein stability, which could have implications for fields such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.

The study reveals that coherent A1 phonons can be generated and controlled by tailored femtosecond pulses. The results provide important insights into the coherent dynamics of A1 phonons in Te, which can have significant implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
3433	Graphene nanoribbons are quasi-one-dimensional meterials with finite width. Characterizing a wide class of nanoribbons by edge shape and width, we make a systematic analysis of their electronic properties. The band gap structure of nanoribbons is shown to exhibit a valley structure with stream-like sequences of metallic or almost metallic nanoribbons. Among them, all zigzag nanoribbons are metallic, and armchair nanoribbons are metallic by period of 3. We find that these stream-like sequences correspond to equi-width curves, and that the band gap of chiral and armchair nanoribbons oscillate as a function of the width. Furthermore a possible application of nanoribbons to nanoelectronics is discussed.
2413	This research paper focuses on the study of flux line pinning in high-temperature superconducting thin films. The main objective of the study is to investigate the universal temperature scaling behavior of flux line pinning in these films. The researchers have conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of flux line pinning as a function of temperature. The crucial finding of the study is that the flux line pinning force scales with the temperature according to a universal power law. This behavior has been observed in various high-temperature superconducting thin films, and the researchers have concluded that it could be a general feature of these materials. These findings could have significant implications for the development of high-temperature superconducting devices and applications.

4030	This research paper investigates the possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03. The soft-excess emission has been observed in the X-ray spectrum of the cluster and is believed to be associated with the intracluster medium. The study aims to analyze the X-ray data to determine whether the soft-excess emission is of thermal or non-thermal origin. The research findings suggest that the soft-excess emission is likely non-thermal in nature, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the cluster's evolution and the physical processes that drive X-ray emission. The results of this study could help pave the way for future research in the field and provide new insights into the nature of galaxy clusters and their properties.

The survey will provide photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.
2667	This research paper presents a new method to reconstruct the intrinsic triaxial shape of the Virgo Cluster using the positions and velocities of its galaxies. The method involves the use of a triaxial model and Bayesian analysis to determine the most probable shape of the cluster. The results show that the Virgo Cluster is highly elongated with a triaxial ratio of 1:0.6:0.4. This finding is consistent with previous studies and provides further evidence for the importance of triaxiality in the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. Additionally, the method presented in this paper can be applied to other galaxy clusters to determine their intrinsic shapes and aid in the understanding of their formation and evolution.
768	This research paper explores the relationship between cosmology and semi-conservation of computations in the universe. The main focus is to investigate if the universe is capable of semi-conserving computations, which could have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe. The study employs both theoretical and empirical techniques to analyze this issue. It finds that the universe may indeed be semi-conserving computations, which could have significant consequences for our understanding of the universe's origin and evolution. The study highlights the need for further research in this area to fully comprehend the implications of these findings.
2876	The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well with a diluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation with an in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positively charged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fast oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing times up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole g factor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of hole localization at cryogenic temperatures.
204	This research paper investigates the resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom in multidimensional chaotic map dynamics, with the aim of establishing them as a basis for further analysis. The study employs a combination of numerical simulations and analytical techniques to identify and isolate the resonant modes of the system. Through this analysis, the authors demonstrate that these modes can be effectively controlled and manipulated through external forcing, leading to potentially significant applications in fields such as cryptography and secure communications. Ultimately, the findings of this research provide a valuable contribution to the ongoing study of chaotic systems and their potential for practical use.
D2-78	Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications. The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life.
1981	The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junctions (npn or pnp) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.
2214	As the likely birthplaces of planets and an essential conduit for the buildup of stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in star and planet formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest because of their ability to probe the dynamics, physical and chemical structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such studies to, e.g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks. Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the physical processes governing star and planet formation.
785	We analyse the static solutions of attractive Bose-Einstein condensates under transverse confinement, both with and without axial confinement. By full numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and variational methods we map out the condensate solutions, their energetic properties, and their critical points for instability. With no axial confinement a bright solitary wave solution will tend to decay by dispersion unless the interaction energy is close to the critical value for collapse. In contrast, with axial confinement the only decay mechanism is collapse. The stability of a bright solitary wave solution increases with higher radial confinement. Finally we consider the stability of dynamical states containing up to four solitons and find good agreement with recent experiments.
822	This research paper proposes a generalized stability condition for both generalized and doubly-generalized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. LDPC codes are widely used in communication systems and require a high degree of stability to ensure reliable transmission. The proposed stability condition is derived from a mathematical analysis of the LDPC code structure and provides a more comprehensive approach to stability analysis than previous methods. The effectiveness of the proposed stability condition is demonstrated through simulations, which show improved performance compared to existing stability conditions. The results of this study have significant implications for the design and implementation of LDPC codes in communication systems.
1524	First results of observations of the low mass X-ray binary Her X-1/HZ Her performed by the INTEGRAL satellite in July-August 2005 are presented. A significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a dynamical spin-up/spin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical observations of HZ Her are also discussed.
272	Temperature dependent structural phase transitions of SrRuO3 thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) single crystal substrates have been studied using high-resolution x-ray diffraction. In contrast to bulk SrRuO3, coherently strained epitaxial layers do not display cubic symmetry up to ~730 oC and remain tetragonal. Such behavior is believed to be induced by compressive strain between the SrRuO3 layer and SrTiO3 substrate due to lattice mismatch. The tetragonal symmetry during growth explains the single domain growth on miscut SrTiO3 substrates with step edges running along the [100] or [010] direction.
286	We elucidate how black holes form in trans-Planckian collisions. In the rest frame of one of the incident particles, the gravitational field of the other, which is rapidly moving, looks like a gravitational shock wave. The shock wave focuses the target particle down to a much smaller impact parameter. In turn, the gravitational field of the target particle captures the projectile when the resultant impact parameter is smaller than its own Schwarzschild radius, forming a black hole. One can deduce this by referring to the original argument of escape velocities exceeding the speed of light, which Michell and Laplace used to discover the existence of black holes.
3859	This research paper explores the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, with a focus on the case of weighted projective spaces. Abelian symplectic reductions are a powerful tool in algebraic geometry for studying symplectic quotients. The orbifold cohomology of these reductions is a topological invariant that captures the underlying geometric structure of the quotient space. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, and derive explicit formulas for the case of weighted projective spaces. Our results shed new light on the interplay between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry, and have potential applications in a wide range of fields, including mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology.
293	The method for determination of the Supernovae (SNe) explosions frequency distribution function based on the assumption of explosions independence are offered. The method is based on assumption that the sequence of SNe explosions in an individual galaxy is a Poisson sequence. The essence of the method is in the determination of statistical moments of the frequency of the SNe explosions and subsequent determination of distribution function . The program of numerical simulation has been developed for testing the efficiency of the method. Numerical simulations show that even for a small mean number of registered SNe explosions, method allows restoring initial distribution function. The results of numerical simulations are given.
3661	This research paper discusses the crystal channeling of forward protons in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with preserved distribution in phase space. The study focuses on the use of bent crystals to deflect proton beams, while preserving their momentum and transverse distribution. The results show that crystal channeling can be used to manipulate the trajectory of protons without significantly affecting their phase space distribution. This technique has potential applications in high-energy physics experiments, as well as in medical and industrial applications. The study concludes that crystal channeling is a promising tool for manipulating charged particle beams and that further research is needed to optimize the process for practical applications.
3392	The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be defined for each such manifestation.
793	The stock market has been known to form homogeneous stock groups with a higher correlation among different stocks according to common economic factors that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of common economic factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors.
D2-99	The main causes of lung cancer are multifaceted and involve a combination of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. The most significant risk factor is smoking, including both active smoking and secondhand exposure. Cigarettes release numerous harmful chemicals that damage lung cells over time, increasing the likelihood of cancer development. While not everyone who smokes develops lung cancer, the risk is considerably higher for smokers compared to non-smokers. Radon, a radioactive gas found in certain soil types, is another major contributor. It can accumulate in homes and buildings, posing a long-term health risk if exposure levels are high. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, such as emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, as well as cooking fumes from coal or wood.
953	This paper deals with sensors which compute and report linguistic assessments of their values.Such sensors, called symbolic sensors are a natural extension of smart ones when working with control systems which use artificial intelligence based technics. After having recalled the smart sensor concepts, this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones. Links between the physical world and the symbolic one are described. It is then shown how Zadeh's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors. Finally, since the symbolic sensor is a general component, a functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed.
143	We show that a quantum state may be represented as the sum of a joint probability and a complex quantum modification term. The joint probability and the modification term can both be observed in successive projective measurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurement disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part. This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as a nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significance of the Schwinger basis.
2310	The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.
2907	We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons which does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement of light emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomic ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in cells at room temperature.
1956	"The research paper titled ""Adiabatic quantum pumping at the Josephson frequency"" presents a theoretical analysis of the adiabatic quantum pumping of Cooper pairs in a superconducting circuit. The study focuses on the Josephson frequency and its effect on the pumping process. The research findings suggest that the Josephson frequency plays a crucial role in the quantum pumping of Cooper pairs, and the pumping efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing the frequency. The study provides important insights into the fundamental aspects of adiabatic quantum pumping and its potential applications in quantum devices."
1360	The research paper explores the use of the generator coordinate method (GCM) in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) to simplify the memory requirements of the theory. The GCM reduces the number of variables needed to describe the system, making it more computationally efficient. The authors present various applications of the GCM in TDDFT, including the calculation of response functions and the study of excitations in molecules and solids. The paper concludes that the GCM is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of TDDFT calculations while maintaining accuracy.
799	We construct and study a previously defined quantum holographic effective action whose critical equation implies the holographic loop equation of large-N QCD_4 for planar self-avoiding loops in a certain regularization scheme. We extract from the effective action the exact beta function in the given scheme. For the Wilsonean coupling constant the beta function is exacly one loop and the first coefficient agrees with its value in perturbation theory. For the canonical coupling constant the exact beta function has a NSVZ form and the first two coefficients agree with their value in perturbation theory.
274	We use continuum theory to show that chirality is a key thermodynamic control parameter for the aggregation of biopolymers: chirality produces a stable disperse phase of hexagonal bundles under moderately poor solvent conditions, as has been observed in {\it in-vitro} studies of F-actin [O. Pelletier {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 148102 (2003)]. The large characteristic radius of these chiral bundles is not determined by a mysterious long-range molecular interaction but by in-plane shear elastic stresses generated by the interplay between a chiral torque and an unusual, but universal, non-linear gauge term in the strain tensor of ordered chains that is imposed by rotational invariance.
3654	This research paper investigates the formation of quasi-solitons in transversely confined ferromagnetic film media. The authors conducted numerical simulations using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to show that the quasi-solitons are formed due to the interaction between the magnetization and the confinement potential. The study found that the size and shape of the confinement potential play an important role in the formation and dynamics of the quasi-solitons. The results of this study provide insights into the behavior of confined ferromagnetic films and may have potential applications in magnetic data storage and spintronics.
3625	It has long been known that once you cross the event horizon of a black hole, your destiny lies at the central singularity, irrespective of what you do. Furthermore, your demise will occur in a finite amount of proper time. In this paper, the use of rockets in extending the amount of time before the collision with the central singularity is examined. In general, the use of such rockets can increase your remaining time, but only up to a maximum value; this is at odds with the ``more you struggle, the less time you have'' statement that is sometimes discussed in relation to black holes. The derived equations are simple to solve numerically and the framework can be employed as a teaching tool for general relativity.
3996	This research paper explores the feedback from first radiation sources, specifically H- photodissociation. The primary theme is to understand the impact of H- photodissociation on the early universe and its subsequent evolution. The paper presents essential findings on the production of H atoms and the role of H- photodissociation in the formation of molecular hydrogen. The research also highlights the importance of this process in regulating the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the significant role of H- photodissociation in shaping the early universe and its subsequent evolution.
2913	"We report on the realization of a time-domain `St\""uckelberg interferometer', which is based on the internal state structure of ultracold Feshbach molecules. Two subsequent passages through a weak avoided crossing between two different orbital angular momentum states in combination with a variable hold time lead to high-contrast population oscillations. This allows for a precise determination of the energy difference between the two molecular states. We demonstrate a high degree of control over the interferometer dynamics. The interferometric scheme provides new possibilities for precision measurements with ultracold molecules."
2880	A recent polarized x-ray absorption experiment on the high temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 indicates the presence of broken parity symmetry below the temperature, T*, where a pseudogap appears in photoemission. We critically analyze the x-ray data, and conclude that a parity-breaking signal of the kind suggested is unlikely based on the crystal structures reported in the literature. Possible other origins of the observed dichroism signal are discussed. We propose x-ray scattering experiments that can be done in order to determine whether such alternative interpretations are valid or not.
3570	Presented in this paper is the kinematic analysis of a symmetrical three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator. In opposite to serial manipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This property produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility in trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of aspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on the notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse kinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular assembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel manipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle.
3158	Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of Al-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature in a wide range of strain rates where the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed. The experimental stress-time series data have been analyzed using the recurrence analysis technique based on the Recurrence Plot (RP) and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to study the change in the dynamical behavior of the PLC effect with the imposed strain rate. Our study revealed that the RQA is able to detect the unique crossover phenomenon in the PLC dynamics.
2089	This research paper investigates the resummed cross section for jet production at hadron colliders. The study aims to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions for jet production in high energy particle collisions. The research utilizes advanced calculations to resum the logarithmic contributions to the cross section, resulting in a more precise estimation of the jet production rates. The critical outcomes of this study include a reduction in theoretical uncertainties and an improved understanding of the underlying physics of jet production. The research suggests that the resummed cross section calculation can be used as a reliable tool for future experimental analyses. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex processes of jet production and paves the way for further advancements in high energy physics research.
453	Suppose that a target function is monotonic, namely, weakly increasing, and an original estimate of the target function is available, which is not weakly increasing. Many common estimation methods used in statistics produce such estimates. We show that these estimates can always be improved with no harm using rearrangement techniques: The rearrangement methods, univariate and multivariate, transform the original estimate to a monotonic estimate, and the resulting estimate is closer to the true curve in common metrics than the original estimate. We illustrate the results with a computational example and an empirical example dealing with age-height growth charts.
3162	We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system (atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.
1552	The alpha helix-coil phase transition is a fundamental phenomenon in protein folding and stability. In this paper, we present an analysis of ab initio theory predictions for this transition. Our study reveals that the ab initio method accurately predicts the structural changes during the transition, and provides insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the process. We also highlight the importance of the hydrogen bonding network in stabilizing the alpha helix structure. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of protein folding and have potential implications for drug design and protein engineering.
103	We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2) plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not observe the sustained growth.
967	This research paper focuses on the dynamics of a strongly interacting Fermi gas and examines the radial quadrupole mode of the gas. The authors use a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to study the behavior of the gas under different conditions. The findings suggest that the radial quadrupole mode can be used as a sensitive probe of the properties of the gas, including its temperature and interaction strength. The paper concludes that the radial quadrupole mode is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting Fermi gases and could have important applications in areas such as quantum computing and condensed matter physics.
3599	This research paper presents a study on the effects of avalanches on the flux injection into the central hole of a superconducting MgB2 ring. The authors utilize a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical simulations to investigate the behavior of the superconductor under different avalanche conditions. The results show that avalanches can significantly enhance the flux injection, leading to a faster recovery of the superconducting state after a magnetic field disturbance. These findings provide important insights into the dynamics of superconducting materials and have potential applications in various fields, including energy storage and transportation.
1805	We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types, through correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star formation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions, but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.
2955	This research paper presents the AKARI detection of B0104-72.3, an infrared-bright supernova remnant located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using data from the AKARI telescope, we constructed a spectral energy distribution of the remnant and found it to be consistent with a thermal emission model. We also estimated the physical parameters of the remnant, such as its temperature and mass, and compared them to other supernova remnants in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our results suggest that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged remnant with a relatively high temperature and mass, indicating a powerful explosion. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the study of supernova remnants and the evolution of massive stars.
692	This research paper investigates the magnetohydrostatic properties of solar prominences in near-potential coronal magnetic fields. The study utilizes a three-dimensional MHD model to simulate the equilibrium of the prominence plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. The results show that the prominence plasma is supported by the magnetic field, which controls the pressure balance and the plasma density distribution. The dynamics of the prominence plasma are found to be influenced by the interaction between the magnetic field and the gravity of the Sun. The study also reveals the presence of magnetic dips in the prominence plasma, which are responsible for the formation of filamentary structures. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of solar prominences and the role of magnetic fields in their dynamics.
266	This research paper explores the problem of lattice coarsening effects in Monte Carlo simulations, which can lead to inaccurate results. The authors propose a new method for removing these effects by adjusting the string tension parameter in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group algorithm. Using numerical simulations, they demonstrate that this method effectively eliminates lattice coarsening effects and leads to more accurate results. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future Monte Carlo simulations in condensed matter physics. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of carefully considering lattice coarsening effects in Monte Carlo simulations and provides a practical solution for addressing this issue.
2303	"The research paper titled ""Tait's conjectures and odd crossing number amphicheiral knots"" explores the properties of amphicheiral knots, which are mirror images of each other. The paper focuses on Tait's conjectures, which suggest that certain properties of a knot can be determined solely by its planar diagram. The authors provide new evidence for these conjectures by examining odd crossing number amphicheiral knots, and show that they satisfy Tait's conjectures. The paper also introduces new techniques for studying knots and provides insights into the symmetry and topology of amphicheiral knots. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of Tait's conjectures in understanding the properties of knots and sheds light on the fascinating world of knot theory."
1991	Improved actions in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theories are investigated with an emphasis on asymptotic scaling. A new scheme for tadpole improvement is proposed. The standard but heuristic tadpole improvement emerges from a mean field approximation from the new approach. Scaling is investigated by means of the large distance static quark potential. Both, the generic and the new tadpole scheme yield significant improvements on asymptotic scaling when compared with loop improved actions. A study of the rotational symmetry breaking terms, however, reveals that only the new improvement scheme efficiently eliminates the leading irrelevant term from the action.
4049	"Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two, W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2). An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the ""classical"" subsets answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2)."
2190	We investigate one of the consequences of the twisted Poincare symmetry. We derive the charge conservation law and show that the equivalence principle is satisfied in the canonical noncommutative spacetime. We applied the twisted Poincare symmetry to the Weinberg's analysis. To this end, we generalize our earlier construction of the twisted S matrix \cite{Bu}, which apply the noncommutativity to the fourier modes, to the massless fields of integer spins. The transformation formula for the twisted S matrix for the massless fields of integer spin has been obtained. For massless fields of spin 1, we obtain the conservation of charge, and the universality of coupling constant for massless fields of spin 2, which can be interpreted as the equality of gravitational mass and inertial mass, i.e., the equivalence principle.
2300	"The Schr{\""o}dinger-Robertson inequality generally provides a stronger bound on the product of uncertainties for two noncommuting observables than the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, and as such, it can yield a stricter separability condition in conjunction with partial transposition. In this paper, using the Schr{\""o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, the separability condition previously derived from the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra is made stricter and refined to a form invariant with respect to local phase shifts. Furthermore, a linear optical scheme is proposed to test this invariant separability condition."
1965	The research paper focuses on combining observational data from H(z), CMB shift, and SNIa to place constraints on cosmological models. The study aims to determine the best-fit values for the cosmological parameters and test the validity of the standard cosmological model. The results show that the combination of these three observational datasets can provide strong constraints on the cosmological parameters, indicating that the standard cosmological model is a good fit to the data. The paper concludes that future surveys with improved observational data can further enhance the accuracy of cosmological parameter estimation.
3413	This research paper proposes a Bayesian approach to Neuro-Rough models for effective classification and prediction in complex datasets. Neuro-Rough models combine the power of neural networks and rough sets to handle uncertainties and inconsistencies in data. However, selecting appropriate parameters and optimizing the model's performance remains a challenge. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides a probabilistic framework for model training, selection, and evaluation, offering a principled approach to address these issues. Our proposed Bayesian Neuro-Rough model shows promising results on benchmark datasets and demonstrates the potential to improve classification accuracy and interpretability in various applications.
3406	We investigate the phases of the ionic Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). At half-filling, when the interaction strength or the staggered potential dominate we find Mott and band insulators, respectively. When these two energies are of the same order we find a metallic region. Charge and magnetic structure factors demonstrate the presence of antiferromagnetism only in the Mott region, although the externally imposed density modulation is present everywhere in the phase diagram. Away from half-filling, other insulating phases are found. Kinetic energy correlations do not give clear signals for the existence of a bond-ordered phase.
244	"The research paper titled ""Correlators and fractional statistics in the quantum Hall bulk"" investigates the fractional statistics of particles in the quantum Hall effect. The authors use the Chern-Simons theory to model the behavior of these particles and calculate the correlators, or the statistical relationships between different particles. They find that these correlators exhibit fractional statistics, meaning that the particles behave as if they have a fractionally charged or fractional spin. The paper's crucial conclusion is that this fractional behavior arises from the topological properties of the system, rather than the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the exotic behavior of particles in the quantum Hall effect and sheds light on the fundamental properties of matter."
3898	We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
496	This research paper focuses on the absorption spectroscopy of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The paper presents a comprehensive study of the electronic properties and spectroscopic characteristics of individual SWCNTs, using a combination of optical spectroscopy and numerical simulations. The results reveal that the absorption spectra of SWCNTs are highly dependent on their diameter and chirality, and can be used as a powerful tool for their characterization and identification. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential applications of SWCNTs in various fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and biomedicine, and highlights the importance of understanding their optical properties for the development of novel technologies. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the absorption spectroscopy of individual SWCNTs and its implications for future research in this exciting field.
459	Following an approach based on generating function method phase space characteristics of Landau system are studied in the autonomous framework of deformation quantization. Coherent state property of generating functions is established and marginal probability densities along canonical coordinate lines are derived. Well defined analogs of inner product, Cauchy-Bunyakowsy-Schwarz inequality and state functional have been defined in phase space and they have been used in analyzing the uncertainty structures. The general form of the uncertainty relation for two real-valued functions is derived and uncertainty products are computed in states described by Wigner functions. Minimum uncertainty state property of the standard coherent states is presented and uncertainty structures in the case of phase space generalized coherent states are analyzed.
3298	This research paper presents a rigorous path integral approach to solve supersymmetric quantum mechanics problems and to calculate the heat kernel. The method is based on the supersymmetric extension of the Feynman-Kac formula and the associated bosonic and fermionic coherent states. The authors show that the path integral is well-defined and can be expressed in terms of the heat kernel. They also demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to a simple example of a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator and comparing the results with the standard supersymmetric algebraic method. This new path integral approach provides a powerful tool for solving supersymmetric quantum mechanics problems and exploring their physical implications.
1172	Recent experimental work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions have revealed quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization which is fractional in the bipolar regime and integer in the unipolar regime in terms of quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime the electron and hole modes can mix at the p-n boundary, leading to current partition and quantized shot noise plateaus similar to those of conductance, while in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle-hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.
564	We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the age of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the local universe may be genuinely young. Indeed, observational evidence for downsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with decreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational and theoretical viewpoints that metallicity is not an arrow of time. Consequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not necessarely young. Current observations suggest that an old stellar population is present in all metal-poor galaxies, although a couple of cases, e.g. IZw18, remain under debate. Further observations with more sentitive equipement should settle this question in the coming years.
1947	This research paper investigates the diffusion processes on small-world networks with distance-dependent random links. The study explores the effects of random links with distance-dependent probabilities on the dynamics of diffusion processes. The findings reveal that the distance-dependent random links can significantly affect the diffusion process, leading to faster or slower spreading rates depending on the network's parameters. The study suggests that incorporating distance-dependent random links in small-world networks can enhance our understanding of the dynamics of diffusion processes and the underlying mechanisms that control them.
396	The Tracy-Widom distribution functions involve integrals of a Painlev\'e II function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus infinity. There are two consequences of these new representations. The first is the evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of the asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the distribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of Deift, Its, and Krasovsky. The constant terms for the GOE and GSE Tracy-Widom distribution functions are new.
1075	In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.
941	This research paper investigates the relationship between groups of diffeomorphisms and geometric loops of manifolds over ultra-normed fields. We explore the properties of these groups and their interactions with geometric loops, focusing on the topological and geometric structures that emerge. Our approach involves deriving new mathematical frameworks to analyze the properties of these groups and their associated geometric loops, as well as developing novel techniques for characterizing the behavior of these structures. Ultimately, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between groups of diffeomorphisms and geometric loops of manifolds over ultra-normed fields, and to identify potential applications of these structures in various fields of mathematics and physics.
3048	Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.
2332	This research paper explores the use of universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations in general relativity and its application in understanding the evolutions of disk nebula. The study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the mathematical models and equations that are used in general relativity to describe the behavior of disk nebula.

1985	Average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions is proposed as a diagnostic probe of high density (saturation) physics. We show that by introducing and varying a transverse momentum cutoff in the definition of the average transverse momentum, one can eliminate the uncertainty in the overall magnitude of the leading order hadron production cross section in high energy collisions, and semi-quantitatively map the different dynamical regions predicted by the saturation physics. We discuss the applications of this method to pion production at RHIC and LHC and make quantitative predictions for the average transverse momentum of produced pions in the kinematics appropriate for the RHIC and LHC experiments.
85	In this article we calculate the electrical conductivity in QED using the 2PI effective action. We use a modified version of the usual 2PI effective action which is defined with respect to self-consistent solutions of the 2-point functions. We show that the green functions obtained from this modified effective action satisfy ward identities and that the conductivity obtained from the kubo relation is gauge invariant. We work to 3-loop order in the modified 2PI effective action and show explicitly that the resulting expression for the conductivity contains the square of the amplitude that corresponds to all binary collision and production processes.
1443	This research paper explores the superconducting state of an excitonic insulator, a material that exhibits both excitonic and superconducting properties. The central focus of the study is to understand the relationship between the excitonic and superconducting properties and the conditions required for the excitonic insulator to become a superconductor. The paper presents theoretical models and experimental evidence to support the existence of a superconducting state in the excitonic insulator, and proposes potential applications for this material in quantum computing and energy storage. The study concludes that the excitonic insulator is a promising candidate for developing new superconducting materials with unique properties.
3420	"The research paper titled ""Stability of Polytropes"" investigates the stability of polytropic gas spheres. The study focuses on the conditions under which the polytropes maintain their equilibrium and the factors that affect their stability. The paper presents numerical simulations of polytropes with different values of the polytropic index and discusses the impact of rotation and magnetic fields on their stability. The findings indicate that the stability of polytropes is mainly influenced by the polytropic index and rotation, while the magnetic field has a minor effect. The paper concludes that polytropes with higher values of the polytropic index and slower rotation tend to be more stable."
288	In this paper, we study the moduli space of toric vector bundles over a toric variety. We provide a detailed analysis of the geometry and topology of the moduli space, and establish several important results. Specifically, we show that the moduli space is smooth and projective, and that it admits a natural stratification by stability conditions. Additionally, we establish a connection between the moduli space and the combinatorial structure of the associated toric fan. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between geometry and combinatorics in the theory of toric varieties, and offer new insights into the properties of toric vector bundles.
3275	The Navier-Stokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder. This formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergence-free by construction, but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order, whose boundary conditions are coupled. The influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems. The magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior. The influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number.
2835	We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-length Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscattering interaction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function of the bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of the plasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with this picture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasing temperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because for coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the temperature is raised.
D1-26	"The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a ""soup"" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life."
2989	This research paper aims to quantify the evolution of social groups. The study is based on analyzing data from various social networks and online communities. The research uses network analysis and statistical modeling to identify the factors that contribute to the growth and decline of social groups over time. The critical outcomes of the research indicate that the size of a group, the frequency of interactions, and the diversity of members play a crucial role in the evolution of social groups. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering these factors when designing social networks and online communities. The conclusions of the research suggest that by understanding the evolution of social groups, we can create more effective social networks and communities that foster engagement and growth.
D2-74	Greenland is the world’s largest island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, and is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It is geographically part of North America but politically and historically connected to Europe. Greenland is known for its vast ice sheet, which covers about 80% of the island, making it a critical component of global climate systems. The island’s population is relatively small, primarily consisting of Inuit people. Its economy relies heavily on fishing, while tourism and mining are growing sectors. Greenland has significant natural resources, including minerals and oil, though environmental concerns and the impact of climate change, such as melting ice, are major issues. Greenland’s strategic location has also gained geopolitical importance in recent years.
2358	The nucleation of carbon nanotubes on small nickel clusters is studied using a tight binding model coupled to grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. This technique closely follows the conditions of the synthesis of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition. The possible formation of a carbon cap on the catalyst particle is studied as a function of the carbon chemical potential, for particles of different size, either crystalline or disordered. We show that these parameters strongly influence the structure of the cap/particle interface which in turn will have a strong effect on the control of the structure of the nanotube. In particular, we discuss the presence of carbon on surface or in subsurface layers.
3940	The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.

This technique has revealed new insights into protein dynamics, localization, and function, and has been instrumental in the development of new drugs and therapies. In this review, we summarize the key advances in single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and discuss its applications in the study of intracellular processes, protein-protein interactions, and disease mechanisms. We also highlight the challenges and future directions of this rapidly evolving field.
2650	An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.
2180	"The research paper titled ""Intrinsic ripples in graphene"" explores the intrinsic ripples that occur naturally in graphene sheets due to thermal fluctuations. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of graphene at different temperatures, and the results show that the ripples in graphene sheets are intrinsic and can significantly affect the material's mechanical properties. The study also finds that the ripples can lead to the opening of band gaps and the emergence of new electronic states, which can have important implications for graphene-based electronic devices. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic ripples in graphene when designing and fabricating graphene-based materials and devices."
D2-30	More than 1,900 species of edible insects are consumed worldwide. However, this number continues to increase as more studies are carried out on this issue. Most of these known species are collected directly from the natural environment, but available data on the amounts of insects that are ingested worldwide are scarce. In any case, there is agreement that of the hundreds of insect species used as human food worldwide, the most common can be encompassed into four groups: beetles; ants, bees and wasps; grasshoppers and crickets and, finally, moths, caterpillars, and butterflies. According to FAO, the most consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera, 31%), caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 18%) and bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera, 14%).
1408	This research paper delves into the 1874 controversy between the French mathematician Camille Jordan and the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker. At the heart of the debate was the question of the foundations of mathematics, specifically the use of infinite sets and their role in mathematical reasoning. Jordan argued for the validity of infinite sets and their importance in mathematical analysis, while Kronecker maintained that only finite sets and their operations should be considered legitimate in mathematics. The paper examines the arguments made by both mathematicians and the broader implications of this controversy for the development of mathematics in the late 19th century. Ultimately, the paper suggests that the debate between Jordan and Kronecker highlights the tension between the abstract and concrete approaches to mathematics, a tension that continues to shape mathematical inquiry today.

The conclusion drawn from this research is that the relativistic diffusion equation can be derived from the stochastic quantization method, which provides a new perspective on the formulation of the equation and its applications in various fields of physics.

The proposed method demonstrates a promising solution for enhancing video quality in various applications, including surveillance and aerial imaging.
3307	We investigate the possibility to localize scalar field configurations as a model for black hole accretion. We analyze and resolve difficulties encountered when localizing scalar fields in General Relativity. We illustrate this ability with a simple spherically symmetric model which can be used to study features of accreting shells around a black hole. This is accomplished by prescribing a scalar field with a coordinate dependent potential. Numerical solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations are shown, where a scalar filed is indeed confined within a region surrounding a black hole. The resulting spacetime can be described in terms of simple harmonic time dependence.

The authors find that the presence of Lorentz violation affects the energy spectrum and polarization of the emitted radiation. They also discuss the potential for using synchrotron radiation to test for Lorentz violation in the SME. Overall, the paper provides a theoretical framework for studying synchrotron radiation in the context of the SME and highlights the potential for using synchrotron radiation experiments to test for Lorentz violation.

Through a detailed analysis of existing literature and empirical evidence, the paper highlights the importance of non-coding DNA in the evolution of species. The findings suggest that non-coding DNA plays a crucial role in the expression of adaptation, and that its function is governed by a universal law that applies to all living organisms. Overall, this research provides important insights into the mechanisms of evolution and the role of non-coding DNA in shaping the diversity of life on Earth.

2483	A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the Hubble scale at the transition.

The authors present the results of their observations and data analysis, highlighting the importance of phase closure in improving the image fidelity and resolving power of submillimeter arrays. The critical outcome of the research is the demonstration of the feasibility of phase closure measurements at high frequencies and the potential for enhancing the capabilities of submillimeter astronomy in future studies. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications and future directions for research in this field.
2849	The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding, is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme, achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer considerable improvements over these existing results.
1538	We explore the main physical processes which potentially affect the topological signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for a range of toroidal universes. We consider specifically reionisation, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the size of the causal horizon, topological defects and primordial gravitational waves. We use three estimators: the information content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma ranges allowed by present data. We find that only Omega_Lambda, which influences both ISW and the size of the causal horizon, significantly alters the detection for all three estimators considered here.
1759	This research paper investigates the use of the sulphur lines in the near-infrared triplet at 1045 nm to determine sulphur abundances in stars. The study uses high-resolution spectra of a sample of stars to measure the equivalent widths of the sulphur lines and calculate the sulphur abundances. The results show that the SI triplet at 1045 nm is a reliable indicator of sulphur abundance in stars, and the method can be used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and other galaxies. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.
2567	This research paper discusses the interpretation of muon-spin-rotation experiments in the mixed state of type-II superconductors.

They find that the models agree well with the data, suggesting that SBF can be a reliable distance indicator for galaxies. The paper also discusses the potential applications of SBF in cosmology and galaxy evolution studies."
2199	This research paper examines the charges and near-horizon data of black rings, a class of black holes with non-spherical horizons. We provide comments on recent developments in the study of black rings, including various models for the black ring geometry and the use of holography to understand their properties. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the charges and near-horizon data of black rings for the AdS/CFT correspondence and other areas of theoretical physics. Our analysis suggests that black rings may provide important insights into the nature of gravity and the structure of spacetime.
2282	The mechanism of the shift, broadening and quenching of the ammonia inversion frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of the wavefunction.
1436	Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.
1832	"The research paper ""Trapping and Cooling a Mirror to its Quantum Mechanical Ground State"" discusses the experimental achievement of cooling a macroscopic mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state. The researchers used a cavity optomechanical system to trap and cool a mirror in a high-finesse optical cavity, allowing them to observe the quantum behavior of the mirror's motion. The experiment demonstrated the ability to prepare a macroscopic object in its lowest energy state, which has potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement. The paper concludes that this achievement opens up new possibilities for exploring the boundary between classical and quantum physics in macroscopic systems."
3330	We introduce a new spinfoam vertex to be used in models of 4d quantum gravity based on SU(2) and SO(4) BF theory plus constraints. It can be seen as the conventional vertex of SU(2) BF theory, the 15j symbol, in a particular basis constructed using SU(2) coherent states. This basis makes the geometric interpretation of the variables transparent: they are the vectors normal to the triangles within each tetrahedron. We study the condition under which these states can be considered semiclassical, and we show that the semiclassical ones dominate the evaluation of quantum correlations. Finally, we describe how the constraints reducing BF to gravity can be directly written in terms of the new variables, and how the semiclassicality of the states might improve understanding the correct way to implement the constraints.
635	The article describes a study of the open cluster M67 using a multisite campaign to detect Delta Scuti pulsations in blue stragglers, which are stars that appear younger than their surroundings. The study found that several blue stragglers in the cluster exhibit Delta Scuti pulsations, which can provide information about the internal structure and evolution of these stars. Additionally, the study found that the pulsation properties of the blue stragglers in M67 are similar to those observed in other open clusters, suggesting that these stars may have a common origin. Overall, the study provides insights into the properties and evolution of blue stragglers in open clusters, and highlights the importance of multisite campaigns in studying these objects.
3097	"The research paper ""On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants"" examines the possible causes of asymmetries observed in supernova remnants. Using computer simulations, the authors investigate the effects of the initial conditions of the supernova explosion, the shape of the progenitor star, and the surrounding environment on the resulting remnant. They find that a combination of these factors can lead to the observed asymmetries. Additionally, the authors suggest that observations of supernova remnants can provide valuable insights into the properties of the progenitor star and the surrounding environment."
3193	The effect of bias voltages on the statistical properties of rough surfaces has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique and its stochastic analysis. We have characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a rough surface by the stochastic parameters such as roughness exponent, level crossing, and drift and diffusion coefficients as a function of the applied bias voltage. It is shown that these statistical as well as microstructural parameters can also explain the macroscopic property of a surface. Furthermore, the tip convolution effect on the stochastic parameters has been examined.
2147	The Lifshitz-type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the van der Waals interaction between an atom (molecule) and a single-wall carbon nanotube are obtained. The single-wall nanotube is considered as a cylindrical sheet carrying a two-dimensional free electron gas with appropriate boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field. The obtained formulas are used to calculate the van der Waals free energy and force between a hydrogen atom (molecule) and single-wall carbon nanotubes of different radia. Comparison studies of the van der Waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom-nanotube separation distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls.
D1-9	Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery. In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.

The study focuses on the role of convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova core. The simulations reveal that convection plays a crucial role in redistributing energy and momentum in the supernova core. The advective-acoustic cycle, which is driven by convective motions, is found to be a key mechanism for the amplification and propagation of acoustic waves in the core. These findings provide new insights into the complex physical processes that govern supernova explosions.
738	This research paper examines the concept of multiple-event probability in general-relativistic quantum mechanics, and proposes a discrete model as a potential framework for understanding this complex phenomenon. By analyzing the underlying principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, the paper argues that a discrete model may provide a more accurate representation of multiple-event probability than existing continuous models. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the discrete model in predicting the probability of multiple events in complex systems. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and offers a promising avenue for further exploration of multiple-event probability in these fields.
862	We introduce the notion of Differential Sequences of ordinary differential equations. This is motivated by related studies based on evolution partial differential equations. We discuss the Riccati Sequence in terms of symmetry analysis, singularity analysis and identification of the complete symmetry group for each member of the Sequence. The singularity analysis reveals considerable structure for the values of the coefficients of the leading-order terms and resonances of the different principal branches. Full proofs of the symmetry properties are performed for differential equations defined by their recursion properties and not given in explicit form.

The findings suggest the potential use of spin waves as a means of information processing and transmission in future spintronic devices. Overall, the study offers new insights into the behavior of spin waves in ferromagnetic microstrips and their potential for spintronic applications.
1181	"The research paper titled ""Quantum Darwinism in quantum Brownian motion: the vacuum as a witness"" explores the concept of Quantum Darwinism, which suggests that the environment plays a crucial role in the emergence of classical reality from the quantum world. The paper uses the example of quantum Brownian motion to demonstrate how information about a quantum system can be conveyed to the environment, and how this information can be extracted by observers to obtain classical information. The researchers also propose that the vacuum can act as a witness to this process, providing a record of the quantum-to-classical transition. The paper concludes that Quantum Darwinism may provide a framework for understanding the emergence of classical reality, and could have implications for the development of quantum technologies."
1762	"We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr\""odinger equation."
1875	The Wess-Zumino consistency condition is a crucial tool for understanding the behavior of Weyl anomalies in conformal field theories. In this research paper, we explore the general solutions of this condition, which provide insights into the underlying structure of conformal field theories. Our findings reveal that the solutions can be expressed in terms of topological invariants and that they are closely related to the Schwinger terms in the effective action. We also show that the solutions can be used to obtain constraints on the central charges of the theory. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental properties of conformal field theories and has important implications for the broader field of theoretical physics.
2634	The research paper investigates the behavior of relativistic field theories in the presence of a strong background field, focusing on the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The authors develop a formalism for calculating the LLL spectrum and wave functions for various field theories, including QED and QCD, in a strong external magnetic field. They find that the LLL approximation is valid in the strong field regime and can be used to study the dynamics of particles in a magnetic field. The results have applications in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and astrophysics. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future experimental studies.
3233	We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates 0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously difficult to achieve.
3583	This research paper explores the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) for water demand time series forecasting. The study analyzes the performance of both techniques using real-world data from a water distribution system. The results show that both ANN and SVM models can effectively forecast water demand, with SVM outperforming ANN in terms of accuracy and model simplicity. The study also compares the performance of the models with traditional time series forecasting techniques and finds that both ANN and SVM outperform these methods. The study concludes that SVM is a promising technique for water demand forecasting and suggests that it should be further explored in future research.

The EXIT function is a crucial tool in analyzing the performance of iterative decoding algorithms in communication systems. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the existence of certain types of EXIT functions, including the polynomial and rational functions. The study also explores the relationship between the existence of these functions and the properties of the underlying communication channels. The findings reveal that the existence of certain types of EXIT functions is closely related to the characteristics of the channel, such as its capacity and noise characteristics. The research provides valuable insights into the fundamental properties of EXIT functions and their role in communication systems.
1887	This research paper presents an investigation of the Larkin-Imry-Ma (LIM) state in 3He-A confined in aerogel. The LIM state is a unique phase of matter that arises due to the interplay between superfluidity and disorder. Through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and ultrasound measurements, the authors explore the effects of aerogel on the LIM state and observe a reduction in the critical velocity for the onset of turbulence. This suggests that the presence of aerogel enhances the effects of disorder and weakens the superfluidity of 3He-A. These findings have implications for the understanding of superfluidity in disordered systems and may have practical applications in the design of new materials for quantum computing and other technologies.
2550	The research paper focuses on the entropy function and the attractor mechanism for spherically symmetric extremal black holes. It examines the relationship between the entropy function and the near horizon geometry of the black hole, and how it leads to the attractor mechanism. The paper also explores the implications of the attractor mechanism for understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy. The findings suggest that the attractor mechanism provides a powerful tool for studying the thermodynamics of black holes and may help uncover the underlying quantum theory that governs their behavior.
D2-51	"The Big Bang theory is the predominant scientific explanation for our universe's origin, describing not an explosion but rather how the universe expanded from an initial state of extreme density and temperature approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial state, called a singularity, contained all matter in an incredibly hot, dense point before expansion began. Proposed by physicist Georges Lemaître in 1927, the theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (essentially the Big Bang's ""afterglow"") and the abundance of light elements in the universe. Later refinements include cosmic inflation theory, suggesting that the early universe briefly expanded faster than light speed."
2653	This research paper investigates the impact of atomic interactions on quantum accelerator modes. The study utilizes numerical simulations to analyze the behavior of quantum systems under different atomic interaction strengths. The main focus is to understand how these interactions affect the stability and performance of quantum accelerator modes. The findings suggest that stronger atomic interactions lead to a decrease in the stability of these modes, which in turn affects the efficiency of quantum systems. The research also highlights the need for further studies to explore the potential of quantum accelerator modes in practical applications.
2748	"Kinetically constrained spin models are known to exhibit dynamical behavior mimicking that of glass forming systems. They are often understood as coarse-grained models of glass formers, in terms of some ""mobility"" field. The identity of this ""mobility"" field has remained elusive due to the lack of coarse-graining procedures to obtain these models from a more microscopic point of view. Here we exhibit a scheme to map the dynamics of a two-dimensional soft disc glass former onto a kinetically constrained spin model, providing an attempt at bridging these two approaches."
3384	We illustrate through numerical results a number of features of environment-induced decoherence under a broad class of apparatus-environment interactions in quantum measurements wherein the reduced system-apparatus density matrix evolves towards the nearest separable state and, in addition, there occurs a mixing in relevant groups of apparatus microstates (see below). The resulting final state is unique and correctly embodies the measurement statistics even in the absence of environment-induced superselection because of energy differences between these groups of states. The partial transpose remains non-positive throughout the process.
268	We study the multi-spin entanglement for the 1D anisotropic XY model concentrating on the simplest case of three-spin entanglement. As compared to the pairwise entanglement, three-party quantum correlations have a longer range and they are more robust on increasing the temperature. We find regions of the phase diagram of the system where bound entanglement occurs, both at zero and finite temperature. Bound entanglement in the ground state can be obtained by tuning the magnetic field. Thermal bound entanglement emerges naturally due to the effect of temperature on the free ground state entanglement.
1575	This research paper explores the potential of using permutation codes as a basis for constructing space-time codes. By leveraging the properties of permutation codes, we propose a novel construction method for space-time codes that offers improved performance and reduced complexity compared to traditional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and show that our proposed space-time codes outperform existing codes in terms of bit error rate and outage probability. Our findings suggest that permutation codes can serve as a promising foundation for the development of space-time codes and pave the way for further research in this area.
2368	Causality and stability in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics are important conceptual issues. We argue that causality is not restricted to hyperbolic set of differential equations. E.g. heat conduction equation can be causal considering the physical validity of the theory. Furthermore we propose a new concept of relativistic internal energy that clearly separates the dissipative and non-dissipative effects. We prove that with this choice we remove all known instabilities of the linear response approximation of viscous and heat conducting relativistic fluids. In this paper the Eckart choice of the velocity field is applied.
3443	Since S-parameter measurements without uncertainty cannot claim any credibility, the uncertainties in full two-port Vector Network Analyser (VNA) measurements were estimated using total complex differentials (Total Differential Errors). To express precisely a comparison relation between complex differential errors, their differential error regions (DERs) were used. To demonstrate the method in the most accurate case of a direct zero-length thru, practical results are presented for commonly used Z-parameters of a simple, two-port, DC resistive T-network, which was built and tested against frequency with a VNA measurement system extended by two lengthy transmission lines.
3285	We reveal the existence of systematic variations of isobaric fragility in different supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixtures by performing molecular dynamics simulations. The connection between fragility and local structures in the bulk is analyzed by means of a Voronoi construction. We find that clusters of particles belonging to locally preferred structures form slow, long-lived domains, whose spatial extension increases by decreasing temperature. As a general rule, a more rapid growth, upon supercooling, of such domains is associated to a more pronounced super-Arrhenius behavior, hence to a larger fragility.
2497	This research paper explores the concept of electroweak Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance. It presents the theoretical framework and mathematical models that explain the relationship between electroweak symmetry breaking and scale invariance. The paper also discusses the implications of this concept in the context of particle physics and the Standard Model. The main outcome of this research is the identification of the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, which plays a crucial role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The conclusion drawn from this study is that the Higgs boson is essential in providing mass to fundamental particles and that its discovery is a significant milestone in the field of particle physics.
1028	We study the electromagnetic field equations on an arbitrary quantum curved background in the semiclassical approximation of Loop Quantum Gravity. The effective interaction hamiltonian for the Maxwell and gravitational fields is obtained and the corresponding field equations, which can be expressed as a modified wave equation for the Maxwell potential, are derived. We use these results to analyze electromagnetic wave propagation on a quantum Robertson-Walker space time and show that Lorentz Invariance is not preserved. The formalism developed can be applied to the case where back reaction effects on the metric due to the electromagnetic field are taken into account, leading to non covariant field equations.
532	This research paper investigates the dynamics of geometry-induced asymmetric diffusion, where particles diffuse differently in confined geometries compared to unconfined environments. The primary focus is on the impact of geometric confinement on the diffusion of particles, and the results show that confinement alters the diffusion coefficients and generates asymmetric diffusion. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the degree of asymmetry is dependent on the geometry of the confining environment. The study concludes that geometry plays a crucial role in asymmetric diffusion and provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transport of particles in confined environments.
2980	We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss further checks that need to be performed.
3549	This research paper focuses on developing a variable-rate distributed source coding scheme that can effectively deal with Byzantine sensors in wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme employs a novel distortion metric to identify the faulty sensors and excludes them from the decoding process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in the reconstruction quality compared to existing methods. The findings of this research can lead to the development of more reliable and efficient distributed source coding schemes for wireless sensor networks in the presence of Byzantine sensors.
224	In the search for new spintronic materials with high spin-polarization at room-temperature, we have synthesized an osmium based double perovskite with a Curie-temperature of 725 K. Our combined experimental results confirm the existence of a sizable induced magnetic moment at the Os site, supported by band-structure calculations in agreement with a proposed kinetic energy driven mechanism of ferrimagnetism in these compounds. The intriguing property of Sr2CrOsO6 is that it is at the endpoint of a metal-insulator transition due to 5d band filling, and at the same time ferrimagnetism and high-spin polarization is preserved.
500	We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.
242	This research paper aims to investigate the shapes of molecular cloud cores in Orion, a star-forming region in the Milky Way. Using data from the Herschel Space Observatory, we analyze the distribution of dust emission in the cores and model their shapes using statistical methods. Our results show that the majority of the cores have elongated or irregular shapes, indicating the influence of external factors such as turbulence and magnetic fields on their formation. We also find evidence for a correlation between the shapes of the cores and their physical properties, such as mass and density. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex processes involved in the formation of stars and galaxies.
702	This paper investigates the non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles around rapidly rotating Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black holes. We analyze the behavior of test particles in the vicinity of these black holes and show that the presence of a negative cosmological constant can lead to a non-monotonic behavior in the velocity profile. We also examine the effects of the rotation parameter on the velocity profile and demonstrate that it can cause significant deviations from the monotonically increasing behavior observed in the case of non-rotating black holes. Our results have important implications for understanding the dynamics of objects in the vicinity of rapidly spinning black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant, and may have implications for astrophysical observations of these objects.
3677	This research paper focuses on the analysis of white dwarf binary systems using the first round Mock LISA Data Challenges datasets. The primary objective is to infer the physical parameters of these systems by performing Bayesian inference on the Mock LISA data. The study uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters, which include the masses, distances, and orbital parameters of the binary systems. The study finds that the Mock LISA data provides significant constraints on the physical parameters of the white dwarf binary systems. The results show that the inferred parameters are consistent with the known physical properties of these systems. The study concludes that the Mock LISA data is a powerful tool for studying white dwarf binary systems and provides valuable insights into their physical properties.
D1-3	Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.
270	The Sagnac effect is an important phase coherent effect in optical and atom interferometers where rotations of the interferometer with respect to an inertial reference frame result in a shift in the interference pattern proportional to the rotation rate. Here we analyze for the first time the Sagnac effect in a mesoscopic semiconductor electron interferometer. We include in our analysis Rashba spin-orbit interactions in the ring. Our results indicate that spin-orbit interactions increase the rotation induced phase shift. We discuss the potential experimental observability of the Sagnac phase shift in such mesoscopic systems.
3374	This research paper examines the energy distribution of a charged black hole with a minimally coupled scalar field. The study utilizes the Newman-Penrose formalism to derive the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field and investigates the energy distribution in the presence of a black hole charge. The results show that the presence of the charge significantly affects the energy distribution, leading to a shift in the location of the energy peak. Moreover, the study finds that the scalar field's energy density decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. These findings have significant implications for understanding the behavior of charged black holes and their interactions with scalar fields.
1235	We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.
1996	This research paper investigates the observational consequences of a hypothesized helium-rich stellar population in the Omega Centauri cluster. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster to identify potential helium-enriched stars. Our results suggest that such stars are present in the cluster and may be responsible for certain features in the cluster's chemical abundance patterns. Further studies of these stars could provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of Omega Centauri, as well as the broader context of galactic evolution.
53	In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered. For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities. It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy efficiency.
2083	This research paper investigates the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions, specifically the distribution of particles produced in the collision and their correlation with the orientation of the collision. Using experimental data from high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, we analyze the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production and identify various effects that contribute to the observed patterns. Our results suggest that the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions is a powerful tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter that existed in the early universe. Ultimately, this research contributes to our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and has implications for the study of heavy-ion collisions in astrophysics and cosmology.
1372	This research paper investigates the magnetic properties of Sm2Al, a rare earth compound with a unique electronic structure. Through experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that Sm2Al exhibits spin-orbital compensation, a phenomenon where the spin and orbital magnetic moments cancel out each other. This compensation leads to an overall weak ferromagnetic behavior in Sm2Al, which is unlike other known ferromagnets. Our findings provide further insights into the complex interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in rare earth materials and can potentially pave the way for the development of novel magnetic materials with tailored properties.
1377	We propose quantum dynamics for the dipole moving in cosmic string background and show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is still restored even in the presence of dipole moment of the particle. However, we show that the classical scale symmetry is broken due to inequivalent quantization of the the non-relativistic system. The consequence of this quantum anomaly is the formation of bound state in the interval \xi\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \Sigma. We show that within the interval \xi\in(-1,1), cosmic string with zero radius can bind the dipole and the dipole does not fall into the singularity.
3066	This research paper investigates the polarization properties of subwavelength hole arrays composed of rectangular holes. The study explores the effects of the angle of incidence and the dimensions of the holes on the transmission and polarization properties of the arrays. The results demonstrate that the polarization properties of the arrays are highly dependent on the shape and orientation of the holes. The study also suggests that subwavelength hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes can be utilized for controlling the polarization of light in a variety of optical devices. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of subwavelength hole arrays for applications in polarization-sensitive optical systems.
2376	Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin effects.
D2-53	"Lavoisier's Law, formally known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, is one of the fundamental principles in chemistry established by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century . The law states that In a closed system, matter is neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions or physical transformations . In simpler terms, the total mass of substances present before a chemical reaction equals the total mass after the reaction, even though the substances may change form. Lavoisier demonstrated this principle through meticulous experiments where he carefully measured the mass of reactants and products. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794), often called the ""father of modern chemistry,"" formulated this principle around 1774."
493	We study the growth of a directed transportation network, such as a food web, in which links carry resources. We propose a growth process in which new nodes (or species) preferentially attach to existing nodes with high indegree (in food-web language, number of prey) and low outdegree (or number of predators). This scheme, which we call inverse preferential attachment, is intended to maximize the amount of resources available to each new node. We show that the outdegree (predator) distribution decays at least exponentially fast for large outdegree and is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a delta function. The indegree (prey) distribution is poissonian in the large-network limit.
2524	"The research paper titled ""Elasticity with Arbitrarily Shaped Inhomogeneity"" explores the behavior of elasticity in materials that have arbitrary shapes of inhomogeneity. The main theme of the paper is to investigate how the shape, size, and orientation of the inhomogeneity affect the overall elasticity of the material. The study uses mathematical modeling and simulations to analyze the behavior of the material under various conditions. The research findings suggest that the shape and size of the inhomogeneity have a significant impact on the material's elasticity, and the orientation of the inhomogeneity can cause anisotropic behavior. The paper concludes that understanding the impact of inhomogeneity on elasticity is crucial in designing materials with desired properties and developing better models for predicting the behavior of materials."
D2-32	Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives over the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, 'green' means to fuel our cars and targeted therapies for attacking 'superbugs' and diseases, such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical applications. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago.
3970	We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.
2680	We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems: 1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative, with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.
693	Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology' approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger. I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of stability of biological order.
1071	A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom interactions.
3051	This research paper explores the occurrence and properties of chromospheric flares, which are sudden bursts of energy in the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere. The authors analyze data from various sources, including ground-based telescopes and space-based instruments, to better understand the physical mechanisms behind these events. They find that chromospheric flares are often associated with magnetic reconnection, a process by which magnetic fields in the sun's atmosphere release energy and produce high-energy particles. The authors conclude that studying chromospheric flares can provide insight into the dynamics of the sun's atmosphere and its impact on space weather.
3647	Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
3125	Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfully represented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complex number field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') are found for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictly or non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Lie algebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749; math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40, 113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independent invariants and their form, is corroborated.
D2-91	The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state known as a singularity. This singularity then rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, causing space itself to stretch exponentially in a fraction of a second. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing matter to form, leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and eventually the structure of the universe we observe today. Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes the cosmic microwave background radiation (a faint glow left over from the early universe), the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
1544	We prove that the open topological string partition function on a D-brane configuration in a Calabi-Yau manifold X takes the form of a closed topological string partition function on a different Calabi-Yau manifold X_b. This identification shows that the physics of D-branes in an arbitrary background X of topological string theory can be described either by open+closed string theory in X or by closed string theory in X_b. The physical interpretation of the ''bubbling'' Calabi-Yau X_b is as the space obtained by letting the D-branes in X undergo a geometric transition. This implies, in particular, that the partition function of closed topological string theory on certain bubbling Calabi-Yau manifolds are invariants of knots in the three-sphere.
2963	This research paper investigates the relationship between incommensurability and the unconventional superconductor to insulator transition in the Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of incommensurate charge order can lead to the suppression of superconductivity and the emergence of an insulating phase in the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we show that the bond-charge interaction plays a crucial role in the formation of incommensurate charge order and contributes to the suppression of superconductivity. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between charge order, superconductivity, and insulating behavior in strongly correlated electron systems.
1125	We present in this paper the changes in the room temperature magnetic property of ZnO on Mn doping prepared using solvo-thermal process. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation of undoped ZnO showed bifurcation and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. Upon Mn doping the magnetic hysteresis at room temperature and the bifurcation in ZFC-FC magnetization vanishes. The results seem to indicate that undoped ZnO is ferromagnetic while on the other hand the Mn doped ZnO is not a ferromagnetic system. We observe that on addition of Mn atoms the system shows antiferromagnetism with very giant magnetic moments.
3155	The separability criterion for multipartite pure states is an important problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a multipartite pure state can be written as a tensor product of individual states. We present a new separability criterion based on the concept of Schmidt rank and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for separability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our criterion by applying it to a number of examples of multipartite pure states. Our results provide a useful tool for analyzing the entanglement properties of multipartite pure states and have potential applications in quantum information processing.
1919	This research paper investigates the existence of periodic solutions for the Schroedinger equation in higher dimensions with nonlocal smoothing nonlinearities. Using variational techniques and critical point theory, we establish the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions for the equation. The main result is that the nonlocal smoothing nonlinearity promotes the existence of periodic solutions even in higher dimensions. This finding has significant implications for the study of nonlinear wave equations and their applications in physics and engineering. The results provide a deeper understanding of the rich dynamics of nonlinear wave equations with nonlocal smoothing nonlinearities.
2760	This research paper presents a comprehensive modeling of the solar chromosphere, a highly dynamic layer of the Sun's atmosphere, using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The study reveals that the chromosphere is influenced by various physical processes, including magnetic fields, shock waves, and turbulence. The simulations also suggest that the chromosphere plays a crucial role in the formation of the Sun's outer atmosphere and the initiation of space weather events. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex behavior of the Sun and its impact on the Earth's environment.
1718	Feedback from black hole activity is widely believed to play a key role in regulating star formation and black hole growth. A long-standing issue is the relation between the star formation and fueling the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation rates in circumnuclear regions (CNRs). Comparing with the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law, we find that the star formation rates in CNRs of most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to explain the suppressed star formation rates.
3858	These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
1438	We present calculations of the thermal and electric linear response in graphene, including disorder in the self-consistent t-matrix approximation. For strong impurity scattering, near the unitary limit, the formation of a band of impurity states near the Fermi level leads to that Mott's relation holds at low temperature. For higher temperatures, there are strong deviations due to the linear density of states. The low-temperature thermopower is proportional to the inverse of the impurity potential and the inverse of the impurity density. Information about impurity scattering in graphene can be extracted from the thermopower, either measured directly, or extracted via Mott's relation from the electron-density dependence of the electric conductivity.
1609	The research paper presents a new chaotic attractor in a multi-strain epidemiological model that incorporates temporary cross-immunity. The model considers the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of a disease in a population and the temporary immunity that arises from exposure to one strain. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the existence of a chaotic attractor in the model with temporary cross-immunity. The results show that the chaotic behavior can arise due to the interaction between the cross-immunity and the transmission dynamics of the disease. The study concludes that the new chaotic attractor has important implications for understanding the dynamics of multiple strains of a disease and highlights the need for further research in this area.
1232	"The research paper titled ""Electron-electron correlation in graphite"" studies the electronic properties of graphite using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The study finds significant electron-electron correlation effects in graphite, which cannot be accounted for by DFT alone. The researchers observe a strong correlation-induced narrowing of the valence band, which is consistent with many-body electronic interactions. They also find evidence of a correlation-induced bandgap opening in the graphite electronic structure, which had not previously been observed. These findings have implications for understanding the electronic properties of other materials with similar electronic structures."
133	Near-infrared photometry of transiting extrasolar planets can be of great scientific value. It is however not straightforward to reach the necessary millimagnitude precision. Here we report on our attempts to observe transits and secondary eclipses of several extrasolar planets at 2.2 micron. Best results have been obtained on OGLE-TR-113b using the SOFI near-infrared camera on ESO's New Technology Telescope. Its K-band transit shows a remarkably flat bottom indicating low stellar limb darkening. Secondary eclipse photometry has resulted in a formal 3 sigma detection, but residual systematic effects make this detection rather uncertain.
3880	"The research paper titled ""Epitaxial graphene"" discusses the growth and properties of graphene on various substrates using the epitaxial method. The paper highlights the advantages of epitaxial graphene, including high quality, large area, and tunable electronic properties. The paper also discusses the challenges and current progress in the growth of epitaxial graphene on different substrates. The researchers conclude that epitaxial graphene is a promising material for various applications, including electronics, energy devices, and sensors. However, further research is needed to optimize the growth and properties of epitaxial graphene for practical applications."
1691	The research paper explores the chaotic and complex behavior of quantum systems, focusing on the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of a quantum particle in a potential well, revealing the emergence of chaotic behavior as the system evolves. The paper concludes that the complexity of quantum motion is a fundamental property of the quantum world, and that classical mechanics cannot fully explain the behavior of quantum systems. The findings highlight the need for a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for future technological advancements.
20	The influence of a weak random potential on the collective modes of a trapped interacting Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature is calculated in the limit when the correlation length of the disorder is smaller than the healing length of the superfluid. The problem is solved in the Thomas-Fermi limit by generalizing the superfluid hydrodynamic equations to allow for the presence of weak disorder. We find that the disorder-induced frequency-shifts of the low-energy excitations can be of the same order of magnitude as the beyond mean-field corrections in the normal interaction recently observed experimentally.
1348	This research paper investigates the connection between the clump lifetimes and the initial mass function (IMF) of young stellar populations. The study employs numerical simulations of gas clouds collapsing and forming stars to demonstrate that clump lifetimes are directly related to the slope of the IMF. The results indicate that a steeper IMF leads to shorter clump lifetimes, which in turn affect the star formation rate and subsequent evolution of the stellar population. The findings suggest that the IMF plays a crucial role in determining the properties and evolution of young star clusters.
1760	A ToO observation of the TeV-emitting blazar Mrk 421 with INTEGRAL was triggered in June 2006 by an increase of the RXTE count rate to more than 30 mCrab. The source was then observed with all INTEGRAL instruments with the exception of the spectrometer SPI for a total exposure of 829 ks. During this time several outbursts were observed by IBIS and JEM-X. Multiwavelength observations were immediately triggered and the source was observed at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths up to TeV energies. The data obtained during these observations are analysed with respect to spectral evolution and correlated variability. Preliminary results of the analysis are presented in this poster.
3412	This paper proposes a neuro-rough model based on multi-layered perceptron and rough set. The neuro-rough model is then tested on modelling the risk of HIV from demographic data. The model is formulated using Bayesian framework and trained using Monte Carlo method and Metropolis criterion. When the model was tested to estimate the risk of HIV infection given the demographic data it was found to give the accuracy of 62%. The proposed model is able to combine the accuracy of the Bayesian MLP model and the transparency of Bayesian rough set model.
2320	This paper explores the effect of the spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers. By using numerical simulations, the researchers found that spin-flips can significantly impact the gravitational wave signature of the merger. The direction and magnitude of the spins of the black holes can alter the timing and amplitude of the gravitational waves, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of the data if not properly accounted for. The study emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling the spins of the black holes in future gravitational wave observations of supermassive black hole mergers.
1849	We study five-dimensional black holes obtained by compactifying M theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Recent progress in solving topological string theory on compact, one-parameter models allows us to test numerically various conjectures about these black holes. We give convincing evidence that a microscopic description based on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants accounts correctly for their macroscopic entropy, and we check that highly nontrivial cancellations -which seem necessary to resolve the so-called entropy enigma in the OSV conjecture- do in fact occur. We also study analytically small 5d black holes obtained by wrapping M2 branes in the fiber of K3 fibrations. By using heterotic/type II duality we obtain exact formulae for the microscopic degeneracies in various geometries, and we compute their asymptotic expansion for large charges.
3070	This research paper presents a study on the relationship between the transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant, and energy on locally compact spaces. The main objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of these three quantities under different conditions and to establish their interdependence. The research findings suggest that the transfinite diameter and Chebyshev constant are closely related, with the latter being an upper bound for the former. Additionally, the energy of a locally compact space was found to be directly proportional to the square of the Chebyshev constant. These results have important implications in the field of mathematical analysis and can be used to derive new theorems and formulas for various applications.
3889	We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.
1020	Let R be a commutative noetherian local ring and consider the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable totally reflexive R-modules. We prove that if this set is finite, then either it has exactly one element, represented by the rank 1 free module, or R is Gorenstein and an isolated singularity (if R is complete, then it is even a simple hypersurface singularity). The crux of our proof is to argue that if the residue field has a totally reflexive cover, then R is Gorenstein or every totally reflexive R-module is free.
3180	We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants. It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants. We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel conceptual proof.
1134	The research paper investigates advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in astrophysics, where the gas flow is dominated by advection instead of viscosity. The authors propose a model with causal viscosity, which considers the effects of thermal conduction and radiation on the gas flow. The study finds that the causal viscosity model can explain the observed properties of ADAFs, such as their low luminosity and weak X-ray emission. The findings suggest that the causal viscosity model can improve our understanding of the accretion processes around black holes and neutron stars.
3369	We briefly discuss our recent field-theoretic study of polyelectrolyte complexation, which occurs in solutions of two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Charged systems require theoretical methods beyond the mean-field (or self-consistent field) approximation; indeed, mean-field theory is qualitatively incorrect for such polyelectrolyte solutions. Both analytical (one-loop) and numerical (complex Langevin) methods to account for charge correlations are discussed. In particular, the first application of field-theoretic simulations to polyelectrolyte systems is reported. The polyelectrolyte charge-charge correlation length and a phase diagram are provided; effects of charge redistribution are qualitatively explored.
3591	The article discusses the design and development of a new three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism for use in milling machine applications. The mechanism is constructed using a combination of linear and rotational joints, which allows for greater precision and stability during milling operations. The study includes a detailed analysis of the mechanism's kinematics, dynamics, and performance characteristics, and concludes that the new mechanism is highly effective in reducing vibration and improving machining accuracy. The authors suggest that the new mechanism has potential for use in a wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the manufacturing of high-precision components.
2617	Microfluidic chips have been fabricated to study electrokinetic pumping generated by a low voltage AC signal applied to an asymmetric electrode array. A measurement procedure has been established and followed carefully resulting in a high degree of reproducibility of the measurements. Depending on the ionic concentration as well as the amplitude of the applied voltage, the observed direction of the DC flow component is either forward or reverse. The impedance spectrum has been thoroughly measured and analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit diagram. Our observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with theoretical models published in the literature.
371	This research paper explores the properties of optically thick radio cores in narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. The study used observational data from the Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to analyze the spectral energy distributions of these nebulae. The authors found that the radio emission in these objects is likely dominated by synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles. Additionally, the study suggests that these nebulae may be undergoing episodic mass-loss events, which could be responsible for their unique shape. Overall, this research provides important insights into the physical and dynamical processes at work in narrow-waist bipolar nebulae.

The study focuses on the photoisomerization behavior of these compounds in molecular junctions, utilizing theoretical computations and experimental measurements. The critical outcomes of the study show that the switching behavior of the molecular junctions is highly dependent on the substituent groups present in the diarylethene molecules. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of the electronic structure and the orientation of the molecules in the junctions. The research concludes that the switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular junctions can be effectively controlled by modifying the substituent groups present in the molecules. These findings have significant implications for the development of photochromic molecular devices and contribute to the understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the switching mechanism of molecular junctions.
3636	The paper presents a novel approach for designing parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) using Kinetostatic Performance Criteria (KPC) as the basis for design optimization. The KPC approach considers the dynamic performance of the machine tool, such as its stiffness, accuracy, and workspace, in addition to its kinematic performance. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the KPC approach through a case study involving the design of a 5-axis PKMT. The results show that the KPC approach can significantly improve the performance of PKMTs compared to traditional design approaches. The paper concludes that the KPC approach can provide a valuable tool for the design and optimization of PKMTs in various applications.
1062	The study of quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers is an area of active research due to its potential for detecting gravitational waves. In this paper, we investigate the existence of second and higher-order quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers using numerical simulations. Our results show that these modes do indeed exist, and that they can provide valuable information about the properties of the black holes involved in the merger. In particular, we find that the frequencies of these modes are sensitive to the spin of the black holes, providing a new avenue for studying these important astrophysical objects. These findings have important implications for the future detection and analysis of gravitational waves, as well as for our understanding of the dynamics of black hole mergers.
3297	"In a rigorous construction of the path integral for supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a Riemann manifold, based on B\""ar and Pf\""affle's use of piecewise geodesic paths, the kernel of the time evolution operator is the heat kernel for the Laplacian on forms. The path integral is approximated by the integral of a form on the space of piecewise geodesic paths which is the pullback by a natural section of Mathai and Quillen's Thom form of a bundle over this space. In the case of closed paths, the bundle is the tangent space to the space of geodesic paths, and the integral of this form passes in the limit to the supertrace of the heat kernel."
2081	This research paper presents a holographic formula for Q-curvature, a geometric quantity that characterizes the conformal geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The formula is derived using the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates conformal field theories to gravitational theories in anti-de Sitter space. The paper demonstrates that the holographic formula is consistent with known results for Q-curvature in two and four dimensions, and provides new insights into the behavior of Q-curvature in higher dimensions. Notably, the formula suggests that Q-curvature in even dimensions is related to the renormalized volume of the conformal boundary, while in odd dimensions it is related to the integral of the Weyl tensor.
3896	This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex. The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
2306	Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.
353	A comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for the pair-creation contact process is presented. In contrast to the ordinary contact process, whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation is added to the pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical series expansions which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process. Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations.
49	In this paper, pilot-assisted transmission over Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading channels is considered. A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is transmitted every T symbols and T-1 data symbols are transmitted in between the pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are optimized by maximizing this lower bound.
2762	The research paper discusses the discovery of a compact star that is rotating at a frequency of 1122 Hz. The authors explore the implications of this discovery, particularly in relation to the r-mode instability of compact stars. They suggest that this discovery provides evidence for the existence of r-mode oscillations in compact stars and that these oscillations may be responsible for the observed spin-down of some stars. The paper also discusses the potential implications of this discovery for our understanding of the properties of neutron stars and the physics of dense matter. Overall, the authors conclude that this discovery represents an important step forward in our understanding of compact stars and the astrophysical processes that govern their behavior.
1763	This research paper investigates the concept of scale invariance in quantum potential, which leads to the emergence of a globally self-trapped wave function in the Madelung fluid. By exploring the mathematical properties of the Schr dinger equation and analyzing the behavior of the wave function, the study reveals that the presence of a scale-invariant quantum potential allows for the formation of a stable and self-localized wave function that persists over time. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and could have potential applications in the development of new technologies such as quantum computing.
3776	"The research paper titled ""Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic shocks"" investigates the behavior of high-energy particles interacting with relativistic shocks. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate that particle acceleration and radiation losses are closely linked, resulting in a cut-off energy for the particles. The paper also shows that the cut-off energy is determined by the shock velocity and magnetic field strength. The research findings have implications for understanding the origin of cosmic rays and the acceleration of particles in astrophysical environments. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering radiative losses in modeling particle acceleration at relativistic shocks."

Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of numerical analysis and offers a promising approach for the computation of orthogonal rational functions.

Using observational data and numerical simulations, the authors investigate the physical processes that govern the evolution of these disks. They find that the presence of a magnetic field can significantly affect the dynamics and accretion rates of the gas, leading to the formation of spiral structures and the opening of gaps in the disk. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between magnetic fields, gas dynamics, and gravitational forces in shaping the structure and evolution of gaseous inner disks.
3988	Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field- emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field responsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the current-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a metallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a cylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.
3944	I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory of electron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of the electron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate parameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate superconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are examined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity. Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions and phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.
1926	The idea that substantial absorption in AGN could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of QSO evolution was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of X-ray absorbed AGN at z~1 to z~3, that have shown strong emission at 850 mkm. This strong emission is a signature of the copious star formation. In AGN evolution model, the main obscured growth phase of the QSO coincides with formation of the host galaxy spheroid, the completion of which indicates the beginning of the luminous, unobscured phase of the QSO's evolution. The verification of this model at redshifts up to z~6 appears possible via application of the gamma-ray resonant absorption method.
232	This paper presents a unified, purely affine theory of gravitation and electromagnetism, which extends the traditional Einstein-Cartan theory to include electromagnetic fields. The theory proposes a new Lagrangian density, which results in a set of field equations that unify the two fundamental forces. By applying the theory to various physical situations, we find that it accurately predicts the behavior of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The results suggest that a purely affine theory of gravity and electromagnetism can provide a more fundamental and comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of these forces.
2333	The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.
1877	This research paper provides an overview of conservation laws, their relation to the generation of physical fields, and the principles of field theories. The paper examines the significance of conservation laws in understanding the behavior of physical systems and the role they play in the generation of fields. The paper also discusses the principles of field theories, including the concept of symmetry, gauge invariance, and the quantization of fields. Through a comprehensive analysis of these concepts, the paper suggests that a deep understanding of conservation laws and field theories is essential for understanding the fundamental nature of physical phenomena. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of conservation laws and field theories in the development of modern physics and their potential application in future research and technology.
1430	This research paper discusses the use of effective field theory (EFT) in the context of extra dimensions and renormalizability. The authors demonstrate that EFT can be employed to study the effects of extra dimensions on low-energy physics and to investigate the renormalizability of such theories. They also demonstrate that the use of EFT leads to the discovery of new phenomena, such as the appearance of non-renormalizable operators and the need for additional counterterms. The authors conclude that EFT provides a powerful tool for studying theories with extra dimensions and for understanding the role of renormalizability in such theories.
18	We experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in superconducting phase qubits driven by microwave pulses. In a wide range of temperatures, we find that both the decay time and the amplitude of these coherent oscillations remain nearly unaffected by thermal fluctuations. The oscillations are observed well above the crossover temperature from thermally activated escape to quantum tunneling for undriven qubits. In the two-level limit, coherent qubit response rapidly vanishes as soon as the energy of thermal fluctuations kT becomes larger than the energy level spacing of the qubit. Our observations shed new light on the origin of decoherence in superconducting qubits. The experimental data suggest that, without degrading already achieved coherence times, phase qubits can be operated at temperatures much higher than those reported till now.
347	This research paper aims to investigate the domain imaging and domain wall propagation in (Ga,Mn)As thin films subjected to tensile strain. The study involves the use of magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy to observe the magnetic domain patterns and their evolution under applied strain. The focus is on understanding the effect of tensile strain on the magnetic properties of the thin film and the domain wall movement. The results provide insights into the potential applications of (Ga,Mn)As thin films in spintronic devices and offer a new approach to control and manipulate magnetic domains in thin films.
3468	Nuclear medicine (NM) images inherently suffer from large amounts of noise and blur. The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM images.
3205	"We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise."
734	We analyze supersymmetry breaking by anti-self-dual flux in the deformed conifold. This theory has been argued to be a dual realization of susy breaking by antibranes. As such, one might expect it to lead to a hierarchically small breaking scale, but only if the warp factor is taken into account. We verify this by explicitly computing the warp-modified moduli space metric. This leads to a new term, with a power-like divergence at the conifold point, which lowers the breaking scale. We finally point out various puzzles regarding the gauge theory interpretation of these results.
2359	This research paper aims to investigate the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes using a tight-binding grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation approach. The primary focus of the study is to understand the effect of the catalyst nanoparticles' size, type, and concentration on the growth of carbon nanotubes. The significant findings of the study indicate that the optimal catalyst size and concentration play a crucial role in the carbon nanotube's growth, which is consistent with experimental observations. The study also suggests that the use of a binary catalyst system can enhance the growth rate and length of carbon nanotubes. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes and can facilitate the design and optimization of nanotube synthesis techniques.
129	"It is shown that the the interference of above-threshold electron de Broglie waves, generated by an intense laser pulse at a metal surface yields attosecond electron pulses. This inerference is an analogon of the superposition of high harmonics generated from rare gas atoms, resulting in trains of attosecond light pulses.Owing to the inherent kinematic dispersion, the propagation of attosecond de Broglie waves in vacuum is very different from that of attosecond light pulses, which propagate without changing shape. Above the metal surface there are ""collaps bands"" and ""revival layers"" of the electron current even at macroscopic distances. In the range of parameters considered, the maximum value of the current densities of such ultrashort electron pulses has been estimated to be of order of couple of tenths of milliamps per square centimeters."
3480	We have investigated the flux transfer characteristics of a switchable flux transformer comprising a superconducting loop and a DC superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID). This system can be used to couple multiple flux qubits with a controllable coupling strength. Its characteristics were measured using a flux input coil and a DC-SQUID for readout coupled to the transformer loop in a dilution refrigerator. The observed characteristics are consistent with the calculation results. We have demonstrated the reversal of the slope of the characteristics and the complete switching off of the transformer, which are useful features for its application as a controllable coupler for flux qubits.
3986	Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
2847	We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuum process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC) layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold friction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves are obtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. The obtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growth temperature.
880	This research paper investigates the effect of beta-Dystroglycan (beta-DG) processing on Utrophin/DP116 anchorage in normal and MDX mouse Schwann cell membrane. The study found that beta-DG processing significantly affects the localization of Utrophin/DP116 in the Schwann cell membrane, leading to reduced membrane stabilization and increased susceptibility to damage. This suggests that beta-DG processing may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and highlights the potential of Utrophin/DP116 as a therapeutic target for this condition. Overall, these results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and have important implications for the development of novel therapies.
1167	This research paper investigates the cosmological evolution of the Universe, focusing on the transition between intermediate inflation and late-time acceleration. The study considers different inflationary scenarios and examines their impact on the evolution of the Universe.

The analysis is based on observational data from the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structures, and type Ia supernovae. The research aims to provide insights into the nature of the Universe and contribute to the understanding of its evolution. The results suggest that intermediate inflation and late-time acceleration are both viable scenarios, and the choice between them depends on the specific inflationary model and the gravitational theory considered.

Additionally, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of GLSMs in studying geometric properties of partial flag manifolds. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of GLSMs and their applications in algebraic geometry.
631	"The research paper titled ""A Unified Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Large CDMA Systems"" aims to develop a unified approach to power control in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems that can minimize energy consumption while maintaining a satisfactory quality of service (QoS). The approach is based on a joint optimization of power control and user scheduling, which can achieve significant energy savings without compromising the QoS. The research team conducted extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and found that it can achieve up to 50% energy savings compared to traditional power control methods. The notable conclusion of the study is that the proposed unified approach to energy-efficient power control can be a promising solution for large CDMA systems that require both high performance and energy efficiency."
276	We explore further the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions in terms of gauge-invariant matrix variables. Coupling to scalar matter fields is discussed in terms of gauge-invariant fields. We analyze how the screening of adjoint (and other screenable) representations can arise in this formalism. A Schrodinger equation is then derived for the gluelump states which are the daughter states when an adjoint string breaks. A variational solution of this Schrodinger equation leads to an analytic estimate of the string-breaking energy which is within 8.8% of the latest lattice estimates.
3589	This research paper explores the current landscape of supercritical string theory, a theoretical framework that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Through a thorough review of literature and analysis of recent developments in the field, we provide an overview of the key concepts and mathematical structures that underpin supercritical string theory. We also examine the challenges and open questions facing researchers in this area, including the role of supersymmetry, the nature of extra dimensions, and the relationship between string theory and other branches of physics. Our analysis sheds light on the current state of the field and provides a roadmap for future research in this exciting and rapidly evolving area of theoretical physics.
3151	This research paper explores the historical significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 in the development of the concept of gravitational lensing. Through a detailed analysis of historical records and scientific literature, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the observations and interpretations of the nova's behavior, which led to the groundbreaking proposal of the bending of light by gravity. The critical outcomes of this research affirm the significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 as a pivotal event in the history of astrophysics, as it initiated the theoretical framework for gravitational lensing, which has since been confirmed through numerous observations and experiments. This paper concludes that the discovery of Nova Geminorum 1912 and subsequent research in gravitational lensing have broadened our understanding of the universe and opened new avenues for scientific inquiry.
1083	We investigate the behavior of a circuit QED device when the resonator is initially populated with a mesoscopic coherent field. The strong coupling between the cavity and the qubit produces an entangled state involving mesoscopic quasi-pointer states with respect to cavity dissipation. The overlap of the associated field components results in collapse and revivals for the Rabi oscillation. Although qubit relaxation and dephasing do not preserve these states, a simple analytical description of the dissipative dynamics of the circuit QED device including cavity relaxation as well as qubit dissipation is obtained from the Monte-Carlo approach. Explicit predictions for the spontaneous and induced Rabi oscillation signals are derived and sucessfully compared with exact calculations. We show that these interesting effects could be observed with a 10 photon field in forthcoming circuit QED experiments.
3876	We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.
3186	Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of patterns is the delta function.
1357	We derive coupled-cluster equations for three-body Hamiltonians. The equations for the one- and two-body cluster amplitudes are presented in a factorized form that leads to an efficient numerical implementation. We employ low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions and calculate the binding energy of He-4. The results show that the main contribution of the three-nucleon interaction stems from its density-dependent zero-, one-, and two-body terms that result from the normal ordering of the Hamiltonian in coupled-cluster theory. The residual three-body terms that remain after normal ordering can be neglected.
487	We have measured the angular diameter of the transiting extrasolar planet host star HD 189733 using the CHARA O/IR interferometric array. Combining our new angular diameter of 0.377+/-0.024 mas with the Hipparcos parallax leads to a linear radius for the host star of 0.779+/-0.052 Rsol and a radius for the planet of 1.19+/-0.08 RJup. Adopting the mass of the planet as derived by its discoverers, we derive a mean density of the planet of 0.91+/-0.18 g cm-3. This is the first determination of the diameter of an extrasolar planet through purely direct means.
2535	We discuss exact solutions of three-parameter non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills model, which describe the wormholes of a new type. These wormholes are considered to be supported by SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills field, non-minimally coupled to gravity, the Wu-Yang ansatz for the gauge field being used. We distinguish between regular solutions, describing traversable non-minimal Wu-Yang wormholes, and black wormholes possessing one or two event horizons. The relation between the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang wormhole and its throat radius is analysed.
544	This research paper focuses on stochastic optimization algorithms and investigates their effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems. The primary focus is on comparing and analyzing the performance of three popular algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE). The study includes experiments on various benchmark functions and real-world problems. The results show that all three algorithms are capable of finding optimal solutions, but the performance varies depending on the problem type and size. Overall, the study concludes that PSO outperforms GA and DE in most cases and provides insights on the selection of appropriate algorithms for different optimization problems.
41	In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane, and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring, but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to have bound orbits that circle through the ring.
924	This research paper investigates the role of instantons in the construction of hypermultiplets in the heterotic string theory. The authors explore the connection between the instanton number and the dimension of the hypermultiplets, and demonstrate that the instanton number is related to the number of zero modes of the Dirac operator. They also show that certain hypermultiplets can be constructed through the use of instantons, and discuss the implications of these findings for the heterotic string theory. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the relationship between instantons, hypermultiplets, and the heterotic string, and sheds light on the underlying structure of this fundamental aspect of theoretical physics.
522	This research paper proposes a methodology for identifying network communities with high resolution, which captures their primary focus and important discoveries or conclusions. The proposed approach is based on a combination of clustering algorithms and community detection techniques that are optimized to identify the most relevant nodes and edges within the network. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel method that can be applied to a wide range of network structures, including social networks, biological networks, and technological networks. The results of empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying network communities with high precision and accuracy, thereby opening up new avenues for research in this field.
2737	"The research paper titled ""One-time pad booster for Internet"" proposes a novel approach to improve the security of Internet communication by introducing a one-time pad booster. The proposed technique utilizes a pseudo-random number generator and XOR operation to enhance the security of the traditional one-time pad. The experiments conducted on the proposed method demonstrate that it provides better security and confidentiality compared to the existing encryption algorithms. The findings of this research suggest that the one-time pad booster can be an effective solution to enhance the security of Internet communication."
1527	This research paper discusses the possibility of diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV being a trace of dark matter. Dark matter is believed to exist in the universe in large quantities, but its nature remains unknown. The paper analyzes satellite data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to investigate if the observed gamma-rays can be attributed to dark matter. The results show that it is possible that dark matter is responsible for the observed gamma-rays, but other sources cannot be ruled out. Further research is necessary to confirm the significance of the findings.
110	"The research paper titled ""RKKY in half-filled bipartite lattices: graphene as an example"" explores the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in half-filled bipartite lattices using graphene as an example. The study shows that the RKKY interaction in graphene depends on the relative position of the impurities and can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. The researchers also found that the RKKY interaction in graphene is tunable by doping and could be used in spintronics applications. The key conclusion of the study is that the RKKY interaction in half-filled bipartite lattices can be controlled and manipulated, making them potential candidates for future spintronics devices."
2681	This research paper explores the phenomenon of photo-assisted shot noise in Coulomb interacting systems. By using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study demonstrates that the interplay between Coulomb interactions and photo-assisted transport can lead to a non-trivial dependence of shot noise on the photo-excitation power. This effect is found to be robust against variations in system parameters and can be used as a tool to probe the underlying physics of the system. The results provide important insights into the behavior of correlated systems under external perturbations and have potential implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
1105	We present a comparative study of CoO2 layers in the Bi-misfit and NaxCoO2 cobaltates. Co NMR measures the intrinsic susceptibility of the Co layers and is not affected by spurious contributions. At low dopings where room-temperature thermopower (TEP) is large, Curie-Weiss susceptibilities are observed in both materials. But NMR and muSR experiments find neither charge nor spin order down to low temperatures in Bi-misfit, in contrast to the case of NaxCoO2. This demonstrates that metallicity, charge and magnetic orders are specific of the Na layers in NaxCoO2 whereas strong correlations are generic of the cobaltates physics and could explain the large TEP.
1027	"The research paper titled ""Large Nongaussianity from Nonlocal Inflation"" presents a new framework for inflationary models that can generate large non-Gaussianities. The authors propose a nonlocal model of inflation that incorporates higher derivative operators in the action and show that this can lead to a significant increase in the amplitude of non-Gaussianity. They derive the bispectrum and trispectrum of the primordial perturbations and find that the non-Gaussianity can be as large as the current observational bounds. The authors conclude that this new framework provides a promising avenue for future research in understanding the origin of primordial perturbations and the early universe."
3911	This research paper explores the probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations. Fractional diffusion equations have recently gained attention in various fields due to their ability to model anomalous diffusion processes. In this paper, we investigate the probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations and compare them to those generated by classical diffusion equations. We analyze the properties of these distributions and investigate the effects of the fractional order on their shape and moments. We also explore the application of these distributions in real-world problems, such as in finance and biology. Our findings reveal that fractional diffusion equations generate probability distributions that exhibit heavier tails and slower decay rates than those generated by classical diffusion equations, which has significant implications for risk management and decision-making in various fields.
1155	In this paper, a hierarchical cross-layer design approach is proposed to increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity. Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy consumption.
1828	We introduce a convenient parametrization of dark energy models that is general enough to include several modified gravity models and generalized forms of dark energy. In particular we take into account the linear perturbation growth factor, the anisotropic stress and the modified Poisson equation. We discuss the sensitivity of large scale weak lensing surveys like the proposed DUNE satellite to these parameters. We find that a large-scale weak-lensing tomographic survey is able to easily distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from LCDM and to determine the perturbation growth index to an absolute error of 0.02-0.03.
2837	Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.
1461	This research paper explores the states of low energy on Robertson-Walker spacetimes using techniques from quantum field theory. The central focus is on the identification and characterization of these states, which are important for understanding the behavior of quantum fields in cosmological settings. The key findings include the existence of a unique vacuum state that is invariant under the symmetries of the spacetime, as well as the construction of coherent states that provide a semiclassical description of the quantum field. These results have implications for the study of early universe cosmology and the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetimes.
1363	These are the notes for a set of lectures delivered by the two authors at the Les Houches Summer School on `Complex Systems' in July 2006. They provide an introduction to the basic concepts in modern (probabilistic) coding theory, highlighting connections with statistical mechanics. We also stress common concepts with other disciplines dealing with similar problems that can be generically referred to as `large graphical models'. While most of the lectures are devoted to the classical channel coding problem over simple memoryless channels, we present a discussion of more complex channel models. We conclude with an overview of the main open challenges in the field.
2616	This research paper explores the role of supersymmetry and gauge symmetry in the heterotic landscape. The heterotic string theory is a promising candidate for a unified theory of all fundamental forces, and the interplay between supersymmetry and gauge symmetry is crucial in understanding the physics of this theory. This paper investigates the impact of these symmetries on the potential vacua of the heterotic landscape and how they affect the predictions of the theory. We analyze various models of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories and compare their predictions with experimental data. Our findings suggest that while both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry are essential for the consistency of the heterotic string theory, their interplay has significant implications for the phenomenology of the theory.
3820	"This research paper explores the relationship between linkedness and ordered cycles in directed graphs (digraphs). The primary focus is on characterizing the minimum number of linked vertices required to contain all ordered cycles of a digraph. The authors introduce a concept called ""ordered cycle number"" to measure this quantity and provide upper and lower bounds for it. They also investigate the properties of digraphs with a small ordered cycle number and provide examples of digraphs with different ordered cycle numbers. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of the structure and complexity of digraphs by providing insights into the interplay between linkedness and ordered cycles."
2932	Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally. The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces, resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.
1276	J. G. Thompson showed that a finite group G is solvable if and only if every two -generated subgroup is solvable. Recently, Grunevald, Kunyavskii, Nikolova, and Plotkin have shown that the analogue holds for finite-dimensional Lie algebras over infinite fields of characteristic greater than 5. It is a natural question to ask to what extent the two-generated subalgebras determine the structure of the algebra. It is to this question that this paper is addressed. Here, we consider the classes of strongly-solvable and of supersolvable Lie algebras, and the property of triangulability.
4032	This research paper examines the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency potential. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the behavior of an atom subjected to a time-varying potential. The results show that the geometric phase of the atom is highly sensitive to the shape of the potential. Additionally, the study finds that the geometric phase can be used as a tool to manipulate the spin of the atom. Overall, the research highlights the importance of understanding the geometric phase in quantum systems and its potential applications in quantum information processing.
2242	We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by tens of thousands wavelengths.
225	Sr2CrOsO6 is a complex oxide with a unique electronic structure that results in a spin polarized metal-insulator transition. This transition is believed to be caused by the filling of 5d bands in the material. In this research paper, we investigate the electronic structure of Sr2CrOsO6 using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. Our results suggest that the spin polarized metal-insulator transition in this material is indeed driven by 5d band filling. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the development of new materials with similar electronic properties. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental physics behind the spin polarized metal-insulator transition in Sr2CrOsO6 and provides insights into the design of novel electronic materials.
2456	Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and statistics scale with various parameters.
2673	The Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface structure has been studied using a combination of quantitative LEED I-V and ab initio methods. The study focused on the missing half-order spots in the 3x1 diffraction pattern. The results showed that the surface reconstruction is caused by the formation of a Sm-Si dimer row, which creates a new surface unit cell. The missing half-order spots are explained by a symmetry reduction due to the formation of the Sm-Si dimers. The study provides a detailed understanding of the surface structure and the origin of the missing half-order spots, which has important implications for the development of semiconductor devices.
D2-41	Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are part of the Standard Model of particle physics and are classified as elementary particles, meaning they have no known substructure. Quarks come in six types, or flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. They always exist in groups, held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called gluons. The most common quarks in nature are up and down, which combine to form protons and neutrons. Quarks have fractional electric charges and cannot exist independently outside of bound states due to a phenomenon called color confinement.
502	This research paper focuses on the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study Reynolds dilatancy in the bulk of smooth granular flows. The study aims to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the behavior of granular materials, which are ubiquitous in various natural and industrial processes. The results demonstrate that MR imaging can effectively capture the dynamics of granular flow, including the evolution of porosity and velocity fields. The findings also reveal that Reynolds dilatancy plays a significant role in the formation of shear bands and the onset of instability in granular flows. Overall, this study highlights the potential of MR imaging as a powerful tool for investigating the complex behavior of granular materials and advancing our understanding of important physical phenomena.
1830	"We present Very Large Array observations at 7 millimeters wavelength that resolve the dust emission structure in the disk around the young star TW Hydrae at the scale of the ~4 AU (~0.16"") radius inner hole inferred from spectral energy distribution modeling. These high resolution data confirm directly the presence of an inner hole in the dust disk and reveal a high brightness ring that we associate with the directly illuminated inner edge of the disk. The clearing of the inner disk plausibly results from the dynamical effects of a giant planet in formation. In an appendix, we develop an analytical framework for the interpretation of visibility curves from power-law disk models with inner holes."
393	This research paper examines the fundamental parameters of He-weak and He-strong stars, with a focus on their chemical composition, evolution, and observational characteristics. The study uses a combination of theoretical models and observational data to investigate the physical properties of these stars, including their mass, radius, luminosity, and surface temperature. The analysis reveals important differences between He-weak and He-strong stars, including variations in their hydrogen and helium abundance, as well as differences in their evolutionary paths. The research also highlights the relevance of these parameters for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the Universe as a whole. Overall, the study sheds new light on the complex interplay between stellar physics, chemistry, and cosmology.
1095	We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of data warehouses. Benchmarking is useful either to system users for comparing the performances of different systems, or to system engineers for testing the effect of various design choices. While the TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council) standard benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the second one. Our Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized. However, two levels of parameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineering benchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and not a competitor. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management systems.
1208	Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory comprising a collection of BF models and a set of three-form gauge fields are constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based on specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of smooth, local, PT invariant, Lorentz covariant, and Poincare invariant interactions, supplemented with the requirement on the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that the deformation procedure modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations as well as the accompanying algebra.
1874	The general solutions of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for the conformal (or Weyl, or trace) anomalies are derived. The solutions are obtained, in arbitrary dimensions, by explicitly computing the cohomology of the corresponding Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin differential in the space of integrated local functions at ghost number unity. This provides a purely algebraic, regularization-independent classification of the Weyl anomalies in arbitrary dimensions. The so-called type-A anomaly is shown to satisfy a non-trivial descent of equations, similarly to the non-Abelian chiral anomaly in Yang-Mills theory.
2041	This research paper examines the stability properties of strongly magnetized spine sheath relativistic jets, with a primary focus on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Using numerical simulations, the authors find that the stability of the jet depends on the strength of the magnetic field, with weaker fields leading to more unstable jets. Furthermore, they find that the spine-sheath structure of the jet can enhance the stability of the jet by suppressing the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of astrophysical jets, such as those observed in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts.
2855	Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.
415	We prove that a number of classes of separable unital C*-algebras are closed under crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property, including: (1) AI algebras, AT algebras, and related classes characterized by direct limit decompositions using semiprojective building blocks. (2) Simple unital AH algebras with slow dimension growth and real rank zero. (3) C*-algebras with real rank zero or stable rank one. (4) C*-algebras whose quotients all satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Along the way, we give a systematic treatment of the derivation of direct limit decompositions from local approximation conditions by homomorphic images which are not necessarily injective.
3067	The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.
3246	This research paper presents a comprehensive quantum real-space simulation study of ballistic graphene nanoribbon MOSFETs. The simulation results reveal that the device performance is highly dependent on the width and edge configuration of the graphene nanoribbon. The study also highlights the potential of these devices for high-frequency applications due to their high carrier mobility. Additionally, the simulation results indicate the need for improved control over the doping level and edge roughness to optimize device performance. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of graphene nanoribbon MOSFETs for future electronic applications.
3804	Proteins are essential molecules that perform various biological functions in living organisms. Intricate knots in protein structures have recently been discovered and have sparked interest in studying their function and evolution. This research paper aims to explore the role of knots in proteins, including their mechanical stability and enzymatic activity. Additionally, the evolution of knotting in proteins will be investigated, including the possible advantages and disadvantages of having knots in protein structures. The paper will discuss various computational and experimental techniques used to analyze and predict knotting in proteins. Overall, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the functional and evolutionary significance of intricate knots in proteins.
2441	This research paper explores the behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in one dimension at a nonzero chemical potential. We investigate the phase structure of this system and analyze the effects of temperature and chemical potential on the system's properties. Our results show that the system exhibits a rich phase structure, including a chiral condensate phase and a superfluid phase. Moreover, we found that the phase structure is strongly influenced by the chemical potential, which has the potential to significantly impact the fundamental understanding of QCD. Our study has important implications for the study of QCD and sheds light on the possible behavior of this system in extreme conditions.
1617	This research paper explores the electronic structure of a graphene bilayer with a twist. Graphene has been extensively studied due to its unique electronic properties, but adding a twist to the bilayer structure introduces a new level of complexity. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how the twist affects the electronic band structure and density of states. We find that the twist introduces new states near the Fermi level, which could have potential applications in electronic devices. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the electronic properties of twisted graphene bilayers and pave the way for further exploration of their potential technological applications.
3440	This research paper proposes a new standard model for black hole accretion that accounts for the complex interplay between the accretion disk and the black hole's gravitational field. Using numerical simulations, the authors demonstrate that this model can explain a range of observed phenomena, including the production of jets and the variability of accretion disks. The proposed model also has important implications for our understanding of the growth and evolution of black holes. Overall, this research represents a significant step towards a more comprehensive understanding of black hole accretion.
2507	This research paper investigates the deviation of the vacuum refractive index induced by a static gravitational field. The study uses the framework of general relativity to derive the equation for the refractive index deviation and investigates its behavior in different conditions. The critical outcomes of the research show that the refractive index deviation is proportional to the gravitational field strength and the distance from the source of the field. The study also highlights the potential applications of the refractive index deviation in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. The conclusions of the research suggest that the refractive index deviation can be used as a tool for observing and analyzing the properties of gravitational fields and their effects on light propagation.
2486	This research paper explores the intriguing relationship between information, information processing, and gravity. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether gravity influences the processing of information and the communication of information between individuals. The study examines existing theories on the role of gravity in information processing and communication, and analyzes empirical evidence related to the topic. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods, to gather and analyze data. The findings suggest that gravity may influence information processing and communication, particularly in situations where there are significant changes in gravitational forces. The study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the relationship between information, information processing, and gravity and highlights the need for further research in this area.
2247	"The research paper ""Stars and the holographic upper bound on gravitational action"" explores the holographic principle and its implications for the gravitational action of stars. The authors propose a new holographic bound on the action of stars, which constrains the amount of information that can be contained within their gravitational fields. They apply this bound to several astrophysical systems, including neutron stars and black holes, and find that it is consistent with observational data. The authors conclude that the holographic principle provides a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental nature of gravity and the behavior of stars in the universe."
641	We present measurements of current noise in quantum point contacts as a function of source-drain bias, gate voltage, and in-plane magnetic field. At zero bias, Johnson noise provides a measure of the electron temperature. At finite bias, shot noise at zero field exhibits an asymmetry related to the 0.7 structure in conductance. The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field. Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus (where shot noise vanishes), agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron heating.
1713	This research paper investigates the impact of boundary effects on local inflation and the resulting spectrum of density perturbations. The main objectives of the study are to analyze how boundary conditions influence the behavior of scalar fields during inflation and to study the resulting effects on the spectrum of density perturbations. The paper uses numerical simulations to examine the behavior of scalar fields and the resulting perturbation spectrum in different boundary conditions. The key findings of the study suggest that boundary effects can significantly influence the spectrum of density perturbations, leading to deviations from the standard predictions of inflationary models. The study also highlights the importance of accurately accounting for boundary conditions in inflationary models to improve the accuracy of predictions for the early universe.
3831	A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.
946	The Kaluza-Klein excitations of the Higgs bosons of the universal extra dimension model are extremely challenging to detect. We discuss the production and possible detection mechanisms of such excited scalars at the LHC. The dominant production mechanism of such scalars is from the decay of the excited third generation quarks. In particular, the charged Higgs boson has a large production cross-section over most of the parameter space. We highlight how one may detect these excited scalars. We also comment on the production and detection of excited neutral scalars.
314	The research paper explores the problem of navigation on complex networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. The authors investigate various methods for mixing different types of navigation strategies, including random walks and personalized PageRank algorithms, to optimize efficiency and accuracy in reaching desired nodes on the network. The study concludes that a combination of these strategies can provide significant improvements in navigation performance, particularly in large and densely connected networks. The findings have implications for a wide range of applications, from search engines and social networks to transportation systems and disease control.
2690	We generalize the rotationally-invariant formulation of the slave-boson formalism to multiorbital models, with arbitrary interactions, crystal fields, and multiplet structure. This allows for the study of multiplet effects on the nature of low-energy quasiparticles. Non-diagonal components of the matrix of quasiparticle weights can be calculated within this framework. When combined with cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us to address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the superexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We illustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two coupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a two-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).
2312	The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton states in molecular complexes has been proposed.
2740	We study the superconducting state of the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model using Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory, with the Lanczos method as impurity solver. In the under-doped regime, we find a natural decomposition of the one-particle (photoemission) energy-gap into two components. The gap in the nodal regions, stemming from the anomalous self-energy, decreases with decreasing doping. The antinodal gap has an additional contribution from the normal component of the self-energy, inherited from the normal-state pseudogap, and it increases as the Mott insulating phase is approached.
3015	We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities, the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties are determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three- and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the four-particle ring exchange.

2071	For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner part of the disk is expected to make a transition from advection dominance to neutrino cooling. This transition is characterized by sharp changes of the disk properties. I argue here that during this transition, a modest increase of the accretion rate leads to powerful enhancement of the Poynting luminosity of the GRB flow and decrease of its baryon loading. These changes of the characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon energy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.
1409	"What did ""algebra"" mean before the development of the algebraic theories of the 20th century ? This paper stresses the identities taken by the algebraic practices developped during the century long discussion around the equation around the equation of secular inequalities (1766- 1874). In 1874, a strong controversy on the theory of bilinear and quadratic forms opposed Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker. The arithmetical ideal of Kronecker faced Jordan's claim for the simplicity of his algebraic canonical form. As the controversy combined mathematical and historical arguments, it gave rise to the writing of a history of the methods used by Lagrange, Laplace and Weierstrass in a century long mathematical discussion around the ""equation of secular inequalities""."
10	"It is proved that every knot in the major subfamilies of J. Berge's lens space surgery (i.e., knots yielding a lens space by Dehn surgery) is presented by an L-shaped (real) plane curve as a ""divide knot"" defined by N. A'Campo in the context of singularity theory of complex curves. For each knot given by Berge's parameters, the corresponding plane curve is constructed. The surgery coefficients are also considered. Such presentations support us to study each knot itself, and the relationship among the knots in the set of lens space surgeries."
D2-84	Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life, offering critical insights into Earth's history and evolution. They provide evidence of extinct species, helping scientists reconstruct past ecosystems and understand how life has changed over millions of years.

Fossils also provide clues about ancient climates and environmental conditions, helping researchers understand past climate changes and their impacts. By studying fossils, we gain a deeper understanding of life's diversity, the history of our planet.

2076	"The motivations to make ultraviolet (UV) studies of supernovae (SNe) are reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for ""dark energy"" that seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed."
600	In this paper we review the applicability of autofluorescent proteins for single-molecule imaging in biology. The photophysical characteristics of several mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and those of DsRed are compared and critically discussed for their use in cellular biology. The alternative use of two-photon excitation at the single-molecule level or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is envisaged for the study of individual autofluorescent proteins. Single-molecule experiments performed in live cells using eGFP and preferably eYFP fusion proteins are reviewed. Finally, the first use at the single-molecule level of citrine, a more photostable variant of the eYFP is reported when fused to a receptor for neurotransmitter in live cells.

1347	Recent studies of dense clumps/cores in a number of regions of low-mass star formation have shown that the mass distribution of these clumps closely resembles the initial mass function (IMF) of field stars. One possible interpretation of these observations is that we are witnessing the fragmentation of the clouds into the IMF, and the observed clumps are bound pre-stellar cores. In this paper, we highlight a potential difficulty in this interpretation, namely that clumps of varying mass are likely to have systematically varying lifetimes. This timescale problem can effectively destroy the similarity bewteen the clump and stellar mass functions, such that a stellar-like clump mass function (CMF) results in a much steeper stellar IMF. We also discuss some ways in which this problem may be avoided.

The authors conclude that a deeper understanding of the quantum group of isometries can lead to new insights in areas such as mathematical physics, differential geometry, and topology.
D2-72	Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology with engineering, technology, and computational science to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing natural biological systems for specific purposes. It involves advanced genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR for gene editing and synthetic DNA construction, alongside computational modeling and bioprinting. Applications span medicine, environmental science, and industry, including the development of organisms capable of producing medications, biofuels, or addressing environmental challenges.

2388	A combination of the memory function formalism and time-dependent density-functional theory is applied to transport in dilute magnetic semiconductors. The approach considers spin and charge disorder and electron-electron interaction on an equal footing. Within the weak disorder limit and using a simple parabolic approximation for the valence band we show that Coulomb and exchange scattering contributions to the resistivity in GaMnAs are of the same order of magnitude. The positional correlations of defects result in a significant increase of Coulomb scattering, while the suppression of localized spin fluctuations in the ferromagnetic phase contributes substantially to the experimentally observed drop of resistivity below T_c. A proper treatment of dynamical screening and collective excitations is essential for an accurate description of infrared absorption.

The authors use a variety of mathematical techniques to study the behavior of these tachyons, including conformal field theory and homotopy theory. The paper presents several key findings, including the existence of a universal tachyon potential and the emergence of a geometrical tachyon in certain brane configurations. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of tachyons and their role in string theory."
1106	This research paper investigates the interplay between magnetic properties and thermoelectricity in misfit and Na cobaltates. The study involved the synthesis and characterization of the cobaltates, including measuring their magnetic properties and thermoelectricity. The results indicate that the magnetic properties have a significant impact on the thermoelectric performance of the cobaltates. The misfit cobaltates exhibit higher thermoelectric performance than their Na counterparts due to their unique crystal structures and magnetic properties. The findings suggest that the magnetic properties of cobaltates can be tailored to improve their thermoelectric performance, which could have implications for developing more efficient thermoelectric materials.
731	We numerically study the dynamical excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) placed in periodic and quasi-periodic 2D optical lattice (OL). In case of the repulsive mean-field interaction the BEC quantum tunnelling leads to a progressive soliton's splitting and generating of secondary solitons, which migrate to closest trapping potential minima. A nontrivial soliton dynamics appears when a series of pi-pulses (phase kicks) are applied to the optical lattice. Such sudden perturbation produces a dynamic redistribution of the secondary solitons, leading to a formation of an artificial solitonic superlattice. Different geometries of OL are analyzed.

Additionally, the paper highlights the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of black holes and the broader field of physics. Overall, the research provides a valuable contribution to the field of black hole thermodynamics and sheds new light on the complex nature of these enigmatic objects.

Overall, the article highlights the need for new approaches to managing personal digital archives and proposes a potential solution to this increasingly important issue."
2819	Context. A derivation of a generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law for nonthermal collisional rates of excitation by charged perturbers is presented. Aims. Aim of this paper is to find a more general analytical expression for a surface value of the source function which can be used as an addtional tool for verification of the non-LTE radiative transfer codes. Methods. Under the impact approximation hypothesis, static, one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere, constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength and direction, two-level atom model with unpolarized lower level and stimulated emission neglected, we introduce the unphysical terms into the equations of statistical equilibrium and solve the appropriate non-LTE integral equations. Results. We derive a new analytical condition for the surface values of the source function components expressed in the basis of irreducible spherical tensors.
3918	A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.
730	This research paper explores non-Abelian plasma instabilities in two spatial dimensions and draws lessons from them. The study shows how these instabilities can lead to the formation of complex structures in the plasma, such as magnetic vortices and filaments. The findings suggest that these instabilities can play a crucial role in the dynamics of non-Abelian plasmas, and can have implications for a range of fields, including astrophysics and fusion energy research. Ultimately, the paper highlights the importance of further research into non-Abelian plasma instabilities to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of these complex systems.
3459	We apply a model for sand dunes to calculate formation of dunes on Mars under the present Martian atmospheric conditions. We find that different dune shapes as those imaged by Mars Global Surveyor could have been formed by the action of sand-moving winds occuring on today's Mars. Our calculations show, however, that Martian dunes could be only formed due to the higher efficiency of Martian winds in carrying grains into saltation. The model equations are solved to study saltation transport under different atmospheric conditions valid for Mars. We obtain an estimate for the wind speed and migration velocity of barchan dunes at different places on Mars. From comparison with the shape of bimodal sand dunes, we find an estimate for the timescale of the changes in Martian wind regimes.
2552	Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta. However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.
439	We discuss the possibility that the strain field introduced by the structural supermodulation in Bi-2212 and certain other cuprate materials may modulate the superconducting pairing interaction. We calculate the amplitude of this effect, visible in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and thereby relate a change in the local superconducting gap with the change in the local dopant displacements induced by the supermodulation. In principle, since this modulation is periodic, sufficiently accurate x-ray measurements or ab initio calculations should enable one to determine which atomic displacements enhance pairing and therefore T_c.
359	The Glassy Wormlike Chain is a fascinating physical phenomenon that arises when flexible polymers are densely packed in a confined space. In this research paper, we investigate the properties and behavior of this peculiar state of matter using a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental techniques. Our findings suggest that the Glassy Wormlike Chain exhibits both solid-like and liquid-like behavior, which has important implications for various applications in materials science and biophysics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Glassy Wormlike Chain can be used as a platform for studying the dynamics of complex fluids under extreme conditions. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental physics of soft matter and provides valuable insights into the design of novel materials with tailored properties.
3287	We numerically investigated the connection between isobaric fragility and the properties of high-order stationary points of the potential energy surface in different supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures. The increase of effective activation energies upon supercooling appears to be driven by the increase of average potential energy barriers measured by the energy dependence of the fraction of unstable modes. Such an increase is sharper, the more fragile is the mixture. Correlations between fragility and other properties of high-order stationary points, including the vibrational density of states and the localization features of unstable modes, are also discussed.
2164	We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions, that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells, are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar
335	The description of resources in game semantics has never achieved the simplicity and precision of linear logic, because of a misleading conception: the belief that linear logic is more primitive than game semantics. We advocate instead the contrary: that game semantics is conceptually more primitive than linear logic. Starting from this revised point of view, we design a categorical model of resources in game semantics, and construct an arena game model where the usual notion of bracketing is extended to multi- bracketing in order to capture various resource policies: linear, af&#64257;ne and exponential.
1994	This research paper explores the linkage between accretion disks and blazars, focusing on the primary theme of understanding the emission mechanisms of these astrophysical objects. The study utilized multi-wavelength observations and numerical simulations to investigate the physical processes involved in the accretion disk and jet formation, as well as the mechanisms that contribute to the observed variability in blazar emission. The findings suggest that the accretion disk plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of blazars, and that the jet launch and collimation are intimately linked to the disk structure and dynamics. The study highlights the importance of a comprehensive understanding of accretion disk physics for interpreting the observations of blazars and other active galactic nuclei.
995	The article discusses cooperative transmission protocols that achieve both high spectral efficiency and high diversity order using multiuser detection and network coding.

The article concludes that CMDNC is a promising protocol for improving the efficiency and reliability of cooperative transmission systems.
708	"The research paper titled ""Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward"" presents an analysis of the diversity performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multihop relay channels using the amplify-and-forward (AF) technique. The paper evaluates the impact of different relay paths and antenna configurations on the diversity gain achieved by the system. The results show that increasing the number of relay nodes and antennas can significantly improve the diversity gain, while the choice of relay path also plays a crucial role. The paper concludes that careful optimization of the relay node locations and antenna configurations can lead to improved diversity performance in MIMO AF multihop relay channels."

The proposed approach employs a hierarchical architecture, where nodes are grouped into clusters and power control is optimized at both cluster and individual node levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves significant energy savings, while maintaining network connectivity and throughput. The outcomes of this research can lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable ad hoc networks, with implications for various applications such as disaster response and military operations.
2697	This research paper investigates the property of kappa-deformed statistics for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. The study focuses on the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution. The main findings suggest that the kappa parameter has a significant impact on the thermodynamic properties of the system. Moreover, the kappa-distribution is shown to have a non-extensive nature, which implies that the system may not obey the standard statistical mechanics. The study concludes that the kappa-deformed statistics can be a useful tool for describing the properties of relativistic gases in electromagnetic fields.
2276	Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance. We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the Fermi velocity.
114	This research paper aims to propose a fault classification method for cylinders utilizing three machine learning techniques, namely Multilayer Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines, and Gaussian Mixture Models.

The proposed method can be useful for fault diagnosis in various industries, such as automotive and aerospace, ultimately leading to improved safety and reliability.
3208	This research paper investigates the particle number requirements for simulating bar-halo friction in galaxies. Bar-halo friction is a phenomenon in which the bar structure of a galaxy interacts with its dark matter halo, causing the rotation of the bar to slow down. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the effects of varying the number of particles in the simulation on the accuracy of the results. The results of the study suggest that a higher number of particles in the simulation is required to accurately capture the effects of bar-halo friction, particularly in galaxies with a low-mass halo. These findings have implications for future simulations of galaxy evolution and provide insight into the complex interactions between the various components of galaxies.
2213	This research paper presents simulations of the aging and plastic deformation of polymer glasses. The simulations show that polymer glasses undergo structural rearrangements during aging, leading to an increase in mechanical properties. Plastic deformation is also observed to occur via the formation of shear bands. The simulations suggest that the mechanical behavior of polymer glasses is strongly influenced by the aging process and the resulting structural changes. Noteworthy findings include the observation of a transition from brittle to ductile behavior with increasing aging time and the dependence of plastic deformation on the strain rate. Overall, the simulations provide insights into the complex mechanical behavior of polymer glasses and can help guide the design of more durable and reliable materials.

The paper highlights the advantages of using RNNs over traditional machine learning algorithms and presents a case study on predicting credit default risk. Through empirical analysis, the research demonstrates the superior accuracy and efficiency of RNN-based risk assessment algorithms. The findings of this study have significant implications for risk management in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
1000	"We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff of coherent time, frequency and time-frequency selective-fading MIMO channels and provide a code design criterion for DM-tradeoff optimality. Our results are based on the analysis of the ""Jensen channel"" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO channel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the mutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff and lends itself nicely to analytical treatment. Finally, as a consequence of our results, we find that the classical rank criterion for space-time code design (in selective-fading MIMO channels) ensures optimality in the sense of the DM-tradeoff."

Overall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of metric geometry and offers insights for further investigations into the structure of finite metric trees.
3841	We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.
2803	We propose a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes.
2652	We consider the influence of the inclusion of interatomic interactions on the delta-kicked accelerator model. Our analysis concerns in particular quantum accelerator modes, namely quantum ballistic transport near quantal resonances. The atomic interaction is modelled by a Gross-Pitaevskii cubic nonlinearity, and we address both attractive (focusing) and repulsive (defocusing) cases. The most remarkable effect is enhancement or damping of the accelerator modes, depending on the sign of the nonlinear parameter. We provide arguments showing that the effect persists beyond mean-field description, and lies within the experimentally accessible parameter range.
1140	We theoretically discuss how to tune the competition between Forster transfer and spontaneous emission in a continuous and nondestructive fashion. The proposed approach is especially suitable for delicate biological systems like light harvesting complexes and fluorescent protein oligomers. We demonstrate that the manipulation of the density of photonic states at the emission frequency of the energy donor results in a change of the quantum efficiencies of the competing energy transfer and spontaneous emission processes. This change will be manifested in a modification of the donor and acceptor emission intensities. Thus, by controlling the local density of photonic states Forster coupled systems can be manipulated and analyzed without the need to physically separate donor and acceptor chromophores for individual analysis, which is of interest, for example, for oligomeric reef coral fluorescent proteins.
2231	This research paper focuses on the order of the 2D polymer escape transition, which refers to the point at which a polymer chain escapes from a confining boundary. The study uses computer simulations to investigate the critical properties of the transition and the effects of various parameters, such as chain length and confinement size. The findings suggest that the order of the transition depends on the degree of confinement and that longer chains require larger confinements to exhibit a second-order transition. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the escape transition in various physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and biological membranes. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the fundamental properties of polymer chains in confined environments and has potential applications in materials science and biophysics.
2494	The high multiplicity of massive stars in dense, young clusters is established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.
789	We study the motion of small particles in a random turbulent flow assuming linear law of friction. We derive a symmetry relation obeyed by the large deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponents in the phase space. The relation applies when either the statistics of the strain matrix is invariant under the transposition or when it is time-reversible. We show that, as a result, the Lyapunov exponents come in pairs which sum is equal to minus the inverse relaxation time of the particles. We use the pairing to consider the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the particles attractor in the phase space. In particular, the results apply to case of the flow which is white noise in time.

The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of these findings for understanding the physics of accretion and the evolution of cataclysmic variables and other accretion systems.
D2-20	For a fossil to exist it needs to survive a long time. Many animals are active kills by predictors. In such cases one might find a few teeth but most bone and tissue is gone. In rain forests the amount of insects make finding anything unlikely. Any animal is quickly dissected. Bones often dissolve in the slightly acid rain. Good places to find fossils are hence riverbeds or banks where cold freezing water quickly kills the animal and sediments are readily available to bury the remains long enough to begin the next step in the fossilization process. Similarly lakes that break through a wall and empty might evaporate and have large amount of fish and other animals.
2286	We propose and analyze a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimator for the atomistic-continuum modeling error in the quasicontinuum method. Based on this error estimator, we develop an algorithm which adaptively determines the atomistic and continuum regions to compute a quantity of interest to within a given tolerance. We apply the algorithm to the computation of the structure of a crystallographic defect described by a Frenkel-Kontorova model and present the results of numerical experiments. The numerical results show that our method gives an efficient estimate of the error and a nearly optimal atomistic-continuum modeling strategy.
473	"In order to obtain more comprehensive information about an celestial object, the radio image must be identified with the optical one. Many years the identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria, which leads to abundant misidentifications and ""empty field"" in optics for the radio sources. For this reason significant part of radio sources do not have identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of radio sources if compared with the optical one. By taking into account the radio refraction, the major number of the radio sources can be successfully identified with the optical objects."
2205	The research paper discusses the concept of gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories. Gauge invariance is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the physical laws should remain the same even when the gauge is changed. The paper explores the impact of massive gauge fields on gauge invariance and the resulting gravitational interactions. The research concludes that gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories can be made gauge invariant by introducing a scalar field that couples to the gauge fields. This coupling allows for the existence of a mass term without breaking the gauge symmetry, leading to consistent gravitational interactions. The findings have important implications for the development of unified theories of fundamental interactions.
1342	"This research paper investigates the nature of ""EIT waves,"" a type of wave observed in the Sun's corona. Using observations from multiple spacecraft and simulations, the authors analyze the properties of these waves and compare them to theoretical models of fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The results suggest that ""EIT waves"" are indeed fast-mode MHD waves, providing important insights into the dynamics of the solar corona and the propagation of waves in a magnetized plasma. These findings have implications for understanding space weather and the potential impact of solar activity on Earth."
1950	This paper concludes our efforts in describing SU(3)-Yang-Mills theories at different couplings/temperatures in terms of effective Polyakov-loop models. The associated effective couplings are determined through an inverse Monte Carlo procedure based on novel Schwinger-Dyson equations that employ the symmetries of the Haar measure. Due to the first-order nature of the phase transition we encounter a fine-tuning problem in reproducing the correct behavior of the Polyakov-loop from the effective models. The problem remains under control as long as the number of effective couplings is sufficiently small.
1878	We report 10 successfully folding events of trpzip2 by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the trizip2 can fold into its native state through different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming hydrophobic core. We also find a very fast non-zipper pathway. This indicates that there may be no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms. These pathways occur with different probabilities. zip-out is the most probable one. This may explain the recent experiment that the turn formation is the rate-limiting step for beta-hairpin folding.
1661	We present the results of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for 18 elements in 31 nearby stars with planets. The resulting abundances are combined with other similar studies of nearby stars with planets and compared to a sample of nearby stars without detected planets. We find some evidence for abundance differences between these two samples for Al, Si and Ti. Some of our results are in conflict with a recent study of stars with planets in the SPOCS database. We encourage continued study of the abundance patterns of stars with planets to resolve these discrepancies.
144	"The research paper, titled ""Quantum Theory of Successive Projective Measurements,"" explores the theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems under multiple measurements. The paper proposes a mathematical model that takes into account the non-commutativity of quantum operators and the collapse of the wave function after each measurement. The results of the study suggest that the outcome of successive measurements is highly dependent on the initial state of the system and the order in which the measurements are performed. The paper concludes that a deeper understanding of successive projective measurements is crucial for the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum communication."
1218	This research paper explores the application of the equal dissipation rate principle to automatic generation of strut-and-tie models. The primary theme is to investigate the effectiveness of this principle in producing accurate and efficient models for complex structures. The study involves developing a new algorithm that automatically generates strut-and-tie models based on the equal dissipation rate principle. The findings suggest that this approach is a promising solution for generating models that satisfy equilibrium, compatibility, and force transfer requirements. The conclusions drawn from this research indicate that the equal dissipation rate principle can be a valuable tool for engineers in designing safe and reliable structures.
2910	The Mathematical Universe is a concept that suggests that mathematics is not just a human invention, but a fundamental aspect of the universe itself. This paper explores the idea that the universe is inherently mathematical, and that all physical phenomena can be explained through mathematical laws and principles. Through an analysis of various theories and observations, it is concluded that mathematics is indeed a universal language that can describe the fundamental nature of the universe. The implications of this idea are far-reaching, as it suggests that mathematics can be used to predict and understand phenomena that were previously thought to be beyond our comprehension. Ultimately, this paper argues that the Mathematical Universe is a powerful and compelling idea that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.
1439	This research paper investigates the role of impurity scattering in the electronic properties of graphene, using the well-known Mott's formula to analyze the scattering effect on the electrical conductivity. The study shows that impurity scattering can significantly modify the conductivity of graphene, leading to a decrease in the conductivity as the impurity concentration increases. Furthermore, the results suggest that the impurity scattering effect can be controlled by tuning the Fermi level of graphene. This work provides important insights into the fundamental electronic properties of graphene and has implications for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.
2601	Recent X-ray surveys have provided a large number of high-luminosity, obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the so-called Type 2 quasars. Despite the large amount of multi-wavelength supporting data, the main parameters related to the black holes harbored in such AGN are still poorly known. Here we present the results obtained for a sample of eight Type 2 quasars in the redshift range 0.9-2.1 selected from the HELLAS2XMM survey, for which we used Ks-band, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS data at 24 micron to estimate bolometric corrections, black hole masses, and Eddington ratios.
3862	We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions.
3041	Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems, called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium. In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type of objects will be presented.
2846	This research paper investigates the linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane. The Cremona group, which consists of birational transformations of the projective plane, is a fundamental object in algebraic geometry. In particular, we focus on the linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group, which has important implications for the study of algebraic surfaces and their automorphisms. We provide a comprehensive study of the linearisation of these subgroups and establish new results regarding their structure and properties. Our research has important applications in algebraic geometry, particularly in the study of algebraic surfaces, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the Cremona group and its subgroups.
756	This research paper investigates the role of entanglement, fidelity and topological entropy in a quantum phase transition to topological order. Through the use of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these measures can effectively capture the transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase. Our results indicate that the topological entropy is a robust measure that is able to detect the transition, while the fidelity enables us to pinpoint the critical point of the transition. Additionally, we show that the entanglement entropy can be used to characterize the different phases. These findings provide insights into the nature of quantum phase transitions and the role of entanglement in topological order.
373	Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe in graphene, at energies close to the Dirac point, is analyzed. It is shown that, in clean systems, the orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed, due to the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. In the presence of preexisting localized states at the Dirac energy, the orthogonality catastrophe shows similar features to those found in normal metals with a finite density of states at the Fermi level. The implications for the Kondo effect induced by magnetic impurities, and for the Fermi edge singularities in tunneling processes are also discussed.
90	"The research paper titled ""Brownian subordinators and fractional Cauchy problems"" studies the behavior of Brownian subordinators, which are stochastic processes that describe the distribution of waiting times between two events. The authors use these subordinators to solve fractional Cauchy problems, which are partial differential equations involving a fractional derivative. They show that the solution to these problems can be expressed in terms of the Laplace transform of the Brownian subordinator. The authors also provide numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of the solution in various scenarios. The key finding of the paper is that Brownian subordinators provide a useful tool for solving fractional Cauchy problems, which have important applications in physics, engineering, and finance."
1267	"We show that if a meromorphic function has a direct singularity over infinity, then the escaping set has an unbounded component and the intersection of the escaping set with the Julia set contains continua. This intersection has an unbounded component if and only if the function has no Baker wandering domains. We also give estimates of the Hausdorff dimension and the upper box dimension of the Julia set of a meromorphic function with a logarithmic singularity over infinity. The above theorems are deduced from more general results concerning functions which have ""direct or logarithmic tracts"", but which need not be meromorphic in the plane. These results are obtained by using a generalization of Wiman-Valiron theory. The method is also applied to complex differential equations."
2395	This research paper explores the dynamics of quintessence, a hypothetical form of dark energy that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The authors investigate the behavior of quintessence in various cosmological models and analyze its impact on the evolution of the universe. They find that quintessence can have a significant effect on the cosmic history and can potentially provide an explanation for the observed acceleration. The study also highlights the importance of considering both the dynamics and the properties of quintessence in order to better understand its role in the universe. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its impact on the evolution of the cosmos.
3442	The article discusses the monitoring of the neutron star 4U 1636-53 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. The study focuses on the long-term evolution of the system and the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in its X-ray emission. The authors analyze the data from RXTE observations spanning over a decade and conclude that the system's X-ray flux and kHz QPO properties undergo significant changes over time. They also suggest that the kHz QPOs might be associated with the accretion flow around the neutron star, and their evolution could provide insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring of X-ray binaries to understand their complex behavior and dynamics.
2469	Disk instability is an attractive yet controversial means for the rapid formation of giant planets in our solar system and elsewhere. Recent concerns regarding the first adiabatic exponent of molecular hydrogen gas are addressed and shown not to lead to spurious clump formation in the author's disk instability models. A number of disk instability models have been calculated in order to further test the robustness of the mechanism, exploring the effects of changing the pressure equation of state, the vertical temperature profile, and other parameters affecting the temperature distribution. Possible reasons for differences in results obtained by other workers are discussed. Disk instability remains as a plausible formation mechanism for giant planets.
1109	Face recognition is a widely researched topic, with neural networks (NNs) being one of the most effective methods for this task. In this paper, we compare the robustness of pairwise and multiclass NNs for face recognition. We evaluate the performance of both types of NNs on a large dataset of faces and compare their accuracy under various conditions, including changes in lighting, pose, and expression. Our results show that multiclass NNs outperform pairwise NNs in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially under challenging conditions. Furthermore, we find that multiclass NNs are more efficient in terms of memory and processing time, making them a better choice for real-time face recognition systems. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate and reliable face recognition systems using NNs.
7	This research paper delves into the area of algebraic topology, where we investigate the relationship between link concordance, homology cobordism, and Hirzebruch-type defects. We explore this relationship through the study of iterated p-covers and their associated groups. Our findings reveal a connection between these structures, with significant implications for our understanding of knot theory and the classification of 4-manifolds. Specifically, we show that the existence of Hirzebruch-type defects in iterated p-covers implies the non-triviality of link concordance classes, and we establish a new criterion for homology cobordism. Our research provides new insights into the interplay between topological invariants, paving the way for further exploration in this area.
3704	The research paper discusses the decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with any order and any number of independent variables. The paper emphasizes the importance of first integrals in understanding the behavior and solving PDEs, and presents a detailed algorithm for using the decomposition method and Maple procedure to find these integrals. The findings of the research show that the proposed method is effective and efficient in finding first integrals for a wide range of nonlinear PDEs, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of mathematical modeling.
D2-33	Computational systems biology is an emerging field in biological simulation that attempts to model or simulate intra- and intercellular events using data gathered from genomic, proteomic or metabolomic experiments. The need to model complex temporal and spatiotemporal processes at many different scales has led to the emergence of numerous techniques, including systems of differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata simulators, agent-based models and pi calculus. This review provides a brief summary and an assessment of most of these approaches. It also provides examples of how these methods are being used to facilitate drug discovery and development. Systems biology is a newly emerging, multi-disciplinary field that studies the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes by treating these processes as integrated systems.
1520	It is known that an explosive instability can occur when nonlinear waves propagate in certain media that admit 3-wave mixing. The purpose of this paper is to show that explosive instabilities can occur even in media that admit no 3-wave mixing. Instead, the instability is caused by 4-wave mixing: four resonantly interacting wavetrains gain energy from a background, and all blow up in a finite time. Unlike singularities associated with self-focussing, these singularities can occur with no spatial structure - the waves blow up everywhere in space, simultaneously.
3948	The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell's equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.
3648	Partial cubes are a class of graphs that have been studied extensively due to their applications in fields such as computer science and chemistry. In this paper, we explore the structure and characterization of partial cubes, as well as their constructions. We prove several important theorems, including a characterization of partial cubes based on their cut vertices, and a construction method for partial cubes based on their spanning trees. Additionally, we investigate the properties and applications of partial cubes in various contexts, such as graph coloring and graph isomorphism. Our results provide a deeper understanding of partial cubes and their significance in both theoretical and practical domains.
4048	This research paper investigates the vortex dynamics in superconductors with a fractal cluster structure at the initial stage of resistive transition. The primary theme is to understand the influence of the fractal dimension of the cluster structure on the vortex dynamics. The study finds that the fractal dimension affects the vortex motion and the critical current density of the superconductor at the initial stage of resistive transition. The results suggest that the fractal dimension can be used as a control parameter to optimize the properties of superconductors for various applications.
2245	This research paper presents a simulation study of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNRFETs) using a numerical device simulator. GNRFETs are a promising technology for building high-performance electronic devices due to their unique electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the performance of GNRFETs by analyzing the device characteristics such as the current-voltage (I-V) curves, the transconductance (gm), and the subthreshold swing (SS). We explore the impact of various parameters such as the channel length, the width, and the gate voltage on the device performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that the GNRFETs exhibit superior performance compared to conventional silicon-based field effect transistors. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of GNRFETs for future device applications.
1625	This research paper investigates the interaction between a high-intensity photon beam and a plasma, with a focus on its possible role in gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission mechanisms. The study uses a relativistic approach to model the interaction and examines the resulting dynamics and radiation emission. The research finds that the photon beam can generate a strong electric field in the plasma, leading to the acceleration of electrons and the production of high-energy photons. These processes can potentially explain some of the observed properties of GRBs, such as their high energy and short duration. The study highlights the importance of considering plasma effects in understanding the physics of GRBs.
2588	The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference, allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.
352	This research paper investigates the conserved charges of spacetimes in both asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter spaces in arbitrary dimensions. The study focuses on the behavior of the charges under diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. The authors develop a new method for computing the charges that is applicable in any dimension and prove that it is equivalent to the standard method used in four dimensions. They also explore the properties of the charges and their relation to symmetries of the spacetimes. This paper provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of conserved charges in higher-dimensional spacetimes and their applications in the study of gravity and gauge theories.
969	"The research paper titled ""Random walks of Wilson loops in the screening regime"" explores the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime using random walk models. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the dynamics of Wilson loops in the presence of heavy screening. The researchers found that the screening effect leads to a decrease in the typical size of the Wilson loops. They also observed that the distribution of Wilson loops becomes more Gaussian as the screening becomes stronger. The study concludes that random walk models can be used to understand the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime."
D2-52	Mainstream physicists treat “quarks” and “gluons” as real particles. However, the observational evidence disagrees with that conclusion. Whereas electron and protons exist for billions of years, “quarks” are only observed for less than billionths of a second. Gluons are not observed at all, but are only theorized. When “quarks” are “observed,” it is during a collision among protons and/or neutrons in an accelerator. After the collision, the “quarks” completely disappear and are never observed again. There has never been an observation of a “sea of quarks” among from which could be used to construct new protons or neutrons. “Quarks” are nothing more than debris from a collision; much like glass shards are debris from a glass striking a brick wall.
2758	This research paper presents HST/ACS coronagraphic observations of the circumstellar dust surrounding HD 100546. The primary focus of the study was to investigate the structure and composition of the dust disk. The authors found that the disk has a complex morphology with multiple dust components, including a bright inner disk and a faint outer halo. They also identified several features that may be indicative of planet formation, such as gaps and asymmetries in the disk. The study provides new insights into the early stages of planet formation and highlights the importance of high-resolution imaging for studying circumstellar disks.
1795	We investigate the mixing-demixing transition and the collapse in a quasi-two-dimensional degenerate boson-fermion mixture (DBFM) with a bosonic vortex. We solve numerically a quantum-hydrodynamic model based on a new density functional which accurately takes into account the dimensional crossover. It is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion, a mixed state of DBFM could turn into a demixed state. The system collapses for interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and demixed states of a DBFM could be experimentally realized by varying an external magnetic field near a boson-fermion Feshbach resonance, which will result in a continuous variation of interspecies interaction.
2119	This research paper explores the dynamics of dislocations in a crystal lattice using the Peierls-Nabarro model. The study focuses on the relief of the lattice and its impact on the movement of dislocations. By analyzing the interactions between dislocations and the lattice relief, the researchers were able to identify key factors that influence the behavior of dislocations. The study also suggests that the Peierls-Nabarro model provides an accurate representation of dislocation dynamics in crystal lattices. Overall, the research contributes to a better understanding of dislocation behavior in materials science and has potential applications in various fields such as engineering and nanotechnology.
1800	This research paper explores the use of canonical partition functions to study hadron spectroscopy. The main objective of the study is to investigate the properties of the hadron resonance spectrum and the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics. The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the canonical partition function to extract information about the hadron spectrum and study its behavior at different temperatures and chemical potentials. The key findings of the study include the identification of a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD and the prediction of new hadronic states that can be tested in future experiments. The authors conclude that the canonical partition function approach provides a powerful tool for studying the properties of the hadron spectrum and can contribute to our understanding of the fundamental forces in nature.
315	We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the radiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large anomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an extra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be generated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the conformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs mass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with the Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as the Z boson decay width.
3366	This paper presents a study on the spin-exchange collisions of submerged shell atoms below 1 Kelvin. We investigate the interaction between two atoms in a cold gas, focusing on the exchange of their magnetic moments. The experimental setup employs a magnetic trap to confine a cloud of ultracold atoms and a radio-frequency technique to measure the spin-exchange rates. Our results show that the spin-exchange cross-section decreases as the temperature decreases, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. We also observed that the collisional relaxation time increases as the density of the gas decreases. Our findings have important implications for the development of quantum computing and atomic clocks.
3234	This research paper presents a novel approach for designing rate-compatible low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that can be efficiently encoded. The proposed method utilizes the concept of puncturing and shortening to achieve rate compatibility. The main contribution of the paper is the development of an efficient algorithm for generating rate-compatible LDPC codes with good performance. The proposed codes are evaluated through simulations, and the results demonstrate that they achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art rate-compatible LDPC codes. The proposed methodology can be used for the design of efficient and flexible communication systems that can adapt to different channel conditions and data rates. Overall, the findings of this research provide insights into the development of rate-compatible LDPC codes that can be efficiently implemented in practical applications.
3639	Under the hypotheses of smoothness in the coupling constant, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, the consistent interactions between a single free massless tensor gauge field with the mixed symmetry of a two-column Young diagram of the type (3,1) and one Abelian vector field have been investigated. The computations are done with the help of the deformation theory based on a cohomological approach, in the context of the antifield-BRST formalism. The main result is that there exist nontrivial cross-couplings between these types of fields in five spatiotemporal dimensions, which break the PT invariance and allow for the deformation of the gauge transformations of the vector field, but not of the gauge algebra.
3160	Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to D2h then to C2h.
D2-18	Insects as food or edible insects are insect species used for human consumption. Over 2 billion people are estimated to eat insects on a daily basis. Globally, more than 2,000 insect species are considered edible, though far fewer are discussed for industrialized mass production and regionally authorized for use in food. Many insects are highly nutritious, though nutritional content depends on species and other factors such as diet and age. Insects offer a wide variety of flavors and are commonly consumed whole or pulverized for use in dishes and processed food products such as burger patties, pasta, or snacks. Like other foods, there can be risks associated with consuming insects, such as allergic reactions.
252	This research paper investigates the behavior of magneto-elastic waves in crystals of magnetic molecules. Through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, we identify the specific characteristics of these waves and their effect on the magnetic properties of the crystal. Our results reveal the crucial role of magneto-elastic coupling in the understanding of magnetic materials and provide insights into the potential applications of these waves in magneto-electronics and spintronics. Overall, this study highlights the significance of magneto-elastic waves in the field of condensed matter physics and serves as a vital step towards developing advanced magnetic materials and devices.
1383	One way to understand the nonthermal history of the universe is by establishing the origins of the unresolved and truly diffuse extragalactic gamma rays. Dim blazars and radio/gamma galaxies certainly make an important contribution to the galactic gamma-ray background given the EGRET discoveries, and previous treatments are reviewed and compared with a new analysis. Studies of the gamma-ray intensity from cosmic rays in star-forming galaxies and from structure formation shocks, as well as from dim GRBs, are briefly reviewed. A new hard gamma-ray source class seems required from the predicted aggregate intensity compared with the measured intensity.
4021	A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are discussed.
744	This research paper investigates the statistics of an unstable barotropic jet using a cumulant expansion. The main objective of this study is to understand the behavior of the jet's unstable modes and their impact on the statistical properties of the flow. The study shows that the barotropic jet's unstable modes play a critical role in determining its statistical properties, including the mean and variance of the velocity field. The researchers also find that the cumulant expansion provides an accurate representation of the flow statistics, even in the presence of strong instabilities. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of barotropic jets in the atmosphere and ocean, and for improving our ability to forecast their behavior.
607	This research paper investigates the impact of emission lines on UBVR photometry in astronomical observations. The study uses a combination of simulations and observations to understand the effects of emission lines on photometric measurements. The results indicate that emission lines can significantly affect photometric measurements, leading to errors in the determination of the intrinsic properties of astronomical objects. The research provides important insights into the factors that must be considered when analyzing photometric data and highlights the need for careful calibration and correction of data. Ultimately, this study contributes to our understanding of the complexities of astronomical observations and provides valuable information for future research in this field.
3615	This research paper presents a study on the use of optical dilution and feedback cooling to achieve ultra-low temperature in a gram-scale oscillator. The experiment involves the use of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator along with a high-power optical cavity to cool the oscillator down to 6.9 mK. The results show that the combined use of these techniques can provide a powerful tool for achieving extremely low temperatures in macroscopic systems. This research has significant implications for developing novel technologies that require ultra-cold temperatures, such as quantum computers and gravitational wave detectors.
81	An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th/0609202, and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in (2+1)-dimensional AdS.
792	This research paper explores the E_6/U(1)_N model and its implications for neutrino mass and dark matter. The authors use a two-loop calculation to determine the neutrino mass, finding that it is sensitive to the choice of parameters in the model. They also investigate the possibility of dark matter particles in the model, considering both a scalar and a fermionic candidate. The authors find that the scalar candidate is ruled out by current experimental limits, but the fermionic candidate remains a viable option. Overall, this research highlights the potential of the E_6/U(1)_N model in explaining both neutrino mass and dark matter, and provides insights into the properties of such particles.
327	We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this test are presented.
3512	In many real-world oscillator systems, the phase response curves are highly heterogeneous. However, dynamics of heterogeneous oscillator networks has not been seriously addressed. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze such a system by dealing explicitly with the heterogeneous phase response curves. We develop a novel method to solve the self-consistent equations for order parameters by using formal complex-valued phase variables, and apply our theory to networks of in vitro cortical neurons. We find a novel state transition that is not observed in previous oscillator network models.
346	We have performed spatially resolved Polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Microscopy measurements on as-grown and annealed Ga0.95Mn0.05As thin films with tensile strain. We find that the films exhibit very strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is increased upon annealing. During magnetic reversal, the domain walls propagate along the direction of surface ripples for the as-grown sample at low temperatures and along the [110] direction for the annealed sample. This indicates that the magnetic domain pattern during reversal is determined by a combination of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a distribution of pinning sites along the surface ripples that can be altered by annealing. These mechanisms could lead to an effective method of controlling domain wall propagation.
2066	This research paper investigates the collective excitations of hard-core bosons at half filling on square and triangular lattices. Using numerical simulations, the paper shows that as the strength of the interactions between the bosons is increased, a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum develops. The paper also finds that this roton minimum collapses at a critical interaction strength, leading to a breakdown of the superfluid state. Additionally, the paper compares the behavior of the bosons on square and triangular lattices, finding that the triangular lattice has a larger roton gap and a stronger tendency towards superfluidity. The results of this study have implications for understanding the behavior of strongly interacting bosons in condensed matter systems.
156	"The research paper titled ""Decoherence of Highly Mixed Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions"" discusses the phenomenon of decoherence in macroscopic quantum systems. The paper explores the effect of decoherence on highly mixed macroscopic quantum superpositions and how it leads to the collapse of the quantum state into a classical state. The authors conclude that the decoherence process is irreversible and that the loss of coherence in macroscopic systems is a fundamental limitation of quantum mechanics. The paper highlights the importance of understanding decoherence in macroscopic systems for the development of quantum technologies and the realization of quantum computing. Overall, the paper provides insights into the behavior of macroscopic quantum systems and the challenges faced in harnessing their full potential."
2504	We study the dynamical process of disentanglement of two qubits and two qutrits coupled to an Ising spin chain in a transverse field, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. We use the concurrence and negativity to quantify entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections between the concurrence (negativity) and the decoherence factors are given for two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner state. We find that the concurrence and negativity decay exponentially with fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental system.
4027	We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases accessible from it.
1143	This research paper investigates the impact of cosmic-ray events on the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) background. IACTs are used to detect very high-energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources, but they are also sensitive to cosmic-ray events that can mimic gamma-ray signals. The study uses Monte Carlo simulations to model the cosmic-ray background in IACTs and evaluates the impact of different analysis techniques and detector configurations. The results show that cosmic-ray events can significantly affect the sensitivity of IACTs to gamma rays, and that careful background modeling and analysis techniques are crucial for obtaining accurate gamma-ray measurements. The study highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of cosmic-ray background in IACT observations and provides useful insights for optimizing future gamma-ray telescope designs.
3232	"The research paper ""New Terms for the Compact Form of Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian"" presents a new approach to describing the interactions between the electroweak fields in a compact form. The authors introduce new terms into the chiral Lagrangian that allow for a more accurate description of the electroweak interactions. The paper also discusses the implications of these new terms for the Higgs boson and the electroweak phase transition. The results of the study suggest that the new terms improve the precision of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and provide a more complete picture of the electroweak interactions. The study's conclusions highlight the importance of continuing research in this area to better understand the fundamental forces of nature."
3161	This research paper investigates the anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon nanotubes. Through molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that the mode frequencies of tangential modes in carbon nanotubes shift unexpectedly with increasing pressure, contrary to the behavior of other types of modes. The cause of this phenomenon was traced to the lengthening of the carbon-carbon bonds in the nanotube due to pressure, which affects the effective spring constants of the tangential modes. The outcomes of this research provide new insights into the mechanical behavior of single-wall carbon nanotubes and have implications for their potential applications in nanoelectronics and nanomechanics.
1855	Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.) has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry of interaction model (context semantics).
310	"The paper titled ""Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB"" discusses the use of a combination of two wireless communication techniques, namely, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), for achieving high data rates in Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems. The paper proposes a novel UWB communication system that uses OFDM as the base modulation scheme and CDMA for spreading the data across different channels. The authors explain the benefits of using this combination, such as high spectral efficiency, improved data security, and low power consumption. They also present simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving high data rates. Overall, the paper concludes that the combination of OFDM and CDMA is a promising technique for achieving high data rates in UWB communication systems."
830	The paper presents a new numerical scheme called ECHO (Eulerian Conservative High Order) for simulating general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and magnetodynamics. This scheme is based on a conservative formulation of the equations and uses high-order accurate finite difference methods. The authors provide extensive testing of the scheme and compare it with other existing numerical schemes. They demonstrate that ECHO is more accurate and efficient for simulating astrophysical scenarios such as accretion disks and compact object mergers. The authors also discuss the physical implications of their simulations, such as the generation of magnetic fields and the formation of relativistic jets. Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of computational astrophysics and offers a new tool for studying complex phenomena in general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics.
2473	Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other dynamical processes in real network systems.
1013	This research paper investigates the dynamics of a phantom field in loop quantum cosmology, a theoretical framework that extends loop quantum gravity to the cosmological scale. Using numerical simulations, the study shows that the evolution of the phantom field is significantly affected by the quantum geometry of the universe, which leads to a modification of the classical dynamics. The results suggest that loop quantum cosmology could provide a viable alternative to the standard inflationary paradigm for explaining the early universe's dynamics. The study also highlights the importance of including quantum effects in cosmological models and opens up new avenues for exploring the interplay between quantum gravity and cosmology.
70	This research paper presents a generic test for modified gravity models that emulate dark matter. The study focuses on the galactic dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and utilizes the Jeans equation to derive the velocity dispersion profiles. The authors compare the predictions of modified gravity models to those of dark matter models and find that some modified gravity models can accurately reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profiles without the need for dark matter. However, the study also highlights the limitations of the generic test and emphasizes the need for further testing and refinement of modified gravity models. The results suggest that modified gravity models have the potential to provide an alternative explanation for the observed galactic dynamics, but more research is needed to fully understand their implications.
1299	We investigate the effects of a nearly uniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on the properties of immersed trapped impurity atoms. Using a weak-coupling expansion in the BEC-impurity interaction strength, we derive a model describing polarons, i.e., impurities dressed by a coherent state of Bogoliubov phonons, and apply it to ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We show that, with increasing BEC temperature, the transport properties of the impurities change from coherent to diffusive. Furthermore, stable polaron clusters are formed via a phonon-mediated off-site attraction.
2558	We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the Planck length.
770	This research paper focuses on the problem of detecting and identifying an unobservable change in the distribution of a random sequence. The joint detection and identification of such a change presents a challenging task due to the lack of prior information on the nature and timing of the change. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem using a Bayesian framework. We provide theoretical analysis and simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting and identifying the change points. Our findings have implications for various applications, such as signal processing and anomaly detection, where the ability to detect and identify changes in data distributions is critical.
1491	"The research paper titled ""The M33 Variable Star Population Revealed by Spitzer"" presents a comprehensive study of the variable star population in the M33 galaxy by analyzing data obtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the different types of variable stars, their properties, and their distribution within the galaxy. The paper presents various important findings, including the identification of new variable stars, the confirmation of previously known variables, and the characterization of the different types of variability. The conclusions drawn from the study provide insights into the evolution and properties of stars in the M33 galaxy and contribute to our understanding of the larger population of stars in the universe."
1944	Starting with an adjoint pair of operators, under suitable abstract versions of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl M-function of extensions of the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions and we establish results on the relationship between the M-function as an analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We also give an example where the M-function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to elliptic PDEs where the M-function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.
3546	Luttinger liquid behavior of one-dimensional correlated electron systems is characterized by power-law scaling of a variety of physical observables with exponents determined by a single interaction dependent parameter K. We suggest a setup to study Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires which allows to determine K from two independent measurements: resonant transport through a quantum dot embedded in the wire and the charge on the dot. Consistency of the two measured values of K for a single probe would provide strong experimental evidence for the Luttinger liquid paradigm.
2009	An interval coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring of E(G) by positive integers such that the colors on the edges incident to any vertex are consecutive. A (3,4)-biregular bigraph is a bipartite graph in which each vertex of one part has degree 3 and each vertex of the other has degree 4; it is unknown whether these all have interval colorings. We prove that G has an interval coloring using 6 colors when G is a (3,4)-biregular bigraph having a spanning subgraph whose components are paths with endpoints at 3-valent vertices and lengths in {2,4,6,8}. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a subgraph.
3197	We consider an anisotropic brane world with Bianchi type I and V geometries where the mechanism of confining the matter on the brane is through the use of a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the special case of a Bianchi type I the solutions of the field equations are obtained in an exact analytic form. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally important parameters.
329	It is widely acknowledged that good object clustering is critical to the performance of object-oriented databases. However, object clustering always involves some kind of overhead for the system. The aim of this paper is to propose a modelling methodology in order to evaluate the performances of different clustering policies. This methodology has been used to compare the performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering overhead.
3399	This research paper examines the use of core and half-mass radii ratios as a tool for identifying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in star clusters. Through simulations and statistical analyses, the study reveals that caution must be exercised when interpreting these ratios as indicators of IMBH presence. The paper highlights the importance of considering various factors, such as cluster size, age, and initial conditions, when interpreting observed ratios. The findings have significant implications for the search for IMBHs in star clusters and suggest that alternative methods may be necessary for their detection.
136	This research paper explores the connection between field theory and the equations for material systems. Specifically, the study investigates how field theory can be applied to understand the behavior of material systems and how this understanding can inform the design of new materials. The research draws on a range of theoretical and empirical literature to build a comprehensive picture of the relationship between field theory and material systems. The main conclusion of this paper is that field theory provides a valuable framework for understanding the behavior of material systems and can be a useful tool for designing new materials with desired properties. The findings of this study have important implications for materials science and engineering and suggest new avenues for research in this field.
661	Nucleon-ion and ion-ion collisions at non relativistic bombarding energies can be described by means of Monte Carlo approaches, such as those based on the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model. We have developed a QMD code, to simulate the fast stage of heavy-ion reactions, and we have coupled it to the de-excitation module available in the FLUKA Monte Carlo transport and interaction code. The results presented in this work span the projectile bombarding energy range within 200 - 600 MeV/A, allowing to investigate the capabilities and limits of our non-relativistic QMD approach.
936	This research paper proposes a generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation that can be applied to a variety of organisms. The mechanism involves the regulation of the cellular energy state via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which in turn affects growth rate through the TOR signaling pathway. The study found that this mechanism can explain the observed growth rate changes in response to nutrient availability and stress in both yeast and mammalian cells. The authors conclude that this mechanism may be a fundamental aspect of growth regulation in all organisms and could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as cancer.
3976	Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
2430	We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques. Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is estimated to be a few nK.
3192	Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.
181	Security of the three-party quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes based on entanglement and a collective eavesdropping check is analyzed in the case of considerable quantum channel losses. An opaque attack scheme is presented for the dishonest agent to eavesdrop the message obtained by the other agent freely, which reveals that these QSS schemes are insecure for transmission efficiencies lower than 50%, especially when they are used to share an unknown quantum state. Finally, we present a general way to improve the security of QSS schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state.
3960	"In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the exclusion principle ""Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential surface simultaneously"" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic energies."
2057	When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible with the Holographic Principle.
2444	A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm, significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and lower electronic noise.
2707	This research paper investigates the structural properties of harmonic and anharmonic Fibonacci chains through molecular dynamics simulations. The study focuses on the relationship between the structure factors and the anharmonicities of the chains. The results show that the anharmonicities significantly affect the structure factors, which can be used to distinguish between harmonic and anharmonic chains. The study also found that the anharmonic Fibonacci chains exhibit a higher degree of disorder than the harmonic chains. These findings provide valuable insights into the structural properties of Fibonacci chains and can contribute to the development of new materials with unique properties.
1952	Phenomenology of the notion of an unparticle U, recently perceived by Georgi, to describe a scale invariant sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point at a higher energy scale is explored in details. Behaving like a collection of d_U (the scale dimension of the unparticle operator O_U) invisible massless particles, this unparticle can be unveiled by measurements of various energy distributions for the processes Z to fermion pair + U and e-e+ to gamma U at e-e+ colliders, as well as mono-jet production at hadron colliders. We also study the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level process and the one-loop muon anomaly.
354	This research paper presents a comparative study of the pair-creation contact process using series expansions. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of the process in different scenarios and to compare the results obtained using different expansion techniques. The study shows that the behavior of the pair-creation contact process is highly dependent on the parameters of the system and the expansion technique used. The outcomes of this study provide insights into the behavior of the pair-creation contact process and can be used to improve the understanding of similar processes in different systems. Overall, the results suggest that the use of series expansions can be an effective tool for studying the behavior of complex systems and can provide valuable insights into their dynamics.
2806	This research paper discusses the use of triangular elements in the boundary element method (BEM) for achieving nearly exact solutions. The main theme is the exploration of different techniques for improving the accuracy of BEM solutions, particularly in cases where the geometry is complex or irregular. The paper presents noteworthy results, including comparisons between different triangular element formulations and their performance in different scenarios. The research concludes that the use of high-order triangular elements can significantly improve the accuracy of BEM solutions and offers a promising approach for future research in this area.
3891	"Moore introduced a class of real-valued ""recursive"" functions by analogy with Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his ""primitive recursive"" functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog computation, fails."
3075	For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an integrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, and also to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for software architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate several types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven approach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small example. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the generation of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to support the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical application domains.
3088	Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h), we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.
1231	The full three dimensional dispersion of the pi-bands, Fermi velocities and effective masses are measured with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and compared to first-principles calculations. The band structure by density-functional theory strongly underestimates the slope of the bands and the trigonal warping effect. Including electron-electron calculation on the level of the GW approximation, however, yields remarkable agreement in the vicinity of the Fermi level. This demonstrates the breakdown of the independent electron picture in semi-metallic graphite and points towards a pronounced role of electron correlation for the interpretation of transport experiments and double-resonant Raman scattering for a wide range of carbon based materials.
3397	This research paper investigates the effect of a fluctuating cutoff on the inflationary spectra. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the cutoff is subject to stochastic fluctuations that could introduce damped corrections to the spectra. We use the stochastic inflationary model to explore this scenario and derive the corresponding equations that govern the dynamics of the cutoff and the spectra. Our analysis shows that the fluctuations in the cutoff can indeed lead to damped corrections to the spectra, which could have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind these corrections and explore their dependence on the parameters of the model. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the cutoff fluctuations could help improve our ability to extract information about the early universe from observational data.
D2-88	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s Hydrogéologie (1802) proposed a holistic, steady-state geological model emphasizing uniformitarianism—the idea that gradual processes shape Earth’s surface over immense time. He theorized that continents erode eastward, with debris deposited westward via global currents, causing a slow continental migration. Lamarck integrated living organisms into Earth’s dynamics, arguing their metabolic activity drives the decomposition and recycling of materials, sustaining planetary equilibrium. This vision positioned biology as central to geology, pioneering ecological thinking by linking abiotic and biotic processes. However, his speculative approach—rooted in outdated four-element chemistry—drew criticism from contemporaries like Georges Cuvier and Antoine Lavoisier. Despite its flaws, Hydrogéologie laid groundwork for synthesizing Earth sciences, envisioning a unified “Physique terrestre” (terrestrial physics) combining meteorology, hydrogeology, and biology
3547	This research paper focuses on investigating the charging behavior of a quantum dot coupled to Luttinger liquid leads. The study employs a theoretical approach to analyze the electron transport properties of the system and explores the effects of Coulomb interactions on the charging dynamics. The results reveal that the charging energy of the quantum dot is significantly influenced by the coupling strength and the Luttinger parameter of the leads. Furthermore, the study indicates that the charging process can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage and the magnetic field. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the physics of charge transport in quantum dot systems and can be useful in the development of future quantum devices.
2051	In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons, forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.
2343	The analysis of databases of photographic images of the Sun (obtained in region of soft x-ray) by means of a method of multilevel dynamical contrasting, has shown presence of skeletal structures of the Sun as outside (chromo-sphere flashes and powerful coronal mass ejections) and on the Sun (structures in its atmosphere, protuberances and of solar a stains). Moreover the structures which radius of rotation is less than radius of a solar disk on breadth of their observation have been revealed. On the basis of the obtained results of this analysis, the author puts forward a hypothesis about an opportunity of existence of some filamentary matter as inside, so outside of the Sun.
423	In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry. We also consider possible improvements to existing text entry evaluation metrics, such as the minimum string distance error rate, keystrokes per character, cost per correction, and a unified approach proposed by MacKenzie, so they can accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese text. Current methods lack an integrated concern about both typing speed and accuracy for Chinese text entry evaluation. Our goal is to remove the bias that arises due to human factors. First, we propose a new metric, called the correction penalty (P), based on Fitts' law and Hick's law. Next, we transform it into the approximate amortized cost (AAC) of information theory. An analysis of the AAC of Chinese text input methods with different context lengths is also presented.
767	Resent works of Hawking and Susskind suggested that information is conserved in the universe. We extend this thesis and propose that dynamics of information - computations can conserve in Anti-de-Sitter cosmological model. Information geometry formalism is proposed to analyze information in dynamical systems. We consider entropy flow as a geometrical flow on statistical manifold and develop a Dynamic Cores model to analyze migration of information in dynamical systems. Geometrical flow on the statistical manifold was considered as a transition of local dynamical systems in original d+1-dim AdS space to their delocalized holographic representation in d-dim Conformal Field Theory (CFT). It was noted that geometrical flow related to renormalization group flow and provide semi-conservation of informational invariants. Those invariants interpreted as types of computations.
2489	The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.
1399	Current techniques for generating a knowledge space, such as QUERY, guarantees that the resulting structure is closed under union, but not that it satisfies wellgradedness, which is one of the defining conditions for a learning space. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the base of a union-closed set family that ensures that the family is well-graded. We consider two cases, depending on whether or not the family contains the empty set. We also provide algorithms for efficiently testing these conditions, and for augmenting a set family in a minimal way to one that satisfies these conditions.
1212	This research paper delves into the question of whether there are any cross-interactions between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field. The study uses mathematical models to explore the theoretical possibilities of such interactions and analyzes experimental data to determine if they exist in the physical world. The results of this research have implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature and provide insights into the behavior of quantum particles. Ultimately, this study sheds light on a complex and important topic in the field of physics and contributes to the ongoing quest for a unified theory of everything.
3692	Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
2881	This research paper focuses on the pseudogap phase of cuprates and the use of X-ray dichroism to study it. The central focus is on understanding the electronic properties of the pseudogap phase and how they relate to the superconducting state. The paper presents important outcomes such as the discovery of a dichroic effect that is sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the crystal axis. The conclusions suggest that X-ray dichroism can provide valuable insights into the pseudogap phase and its relationship to superconductivity in cuprates.
1587	The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes suggested in [1], and modified later in [2], is tested by computing the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is particularized for two important families of spacetimes, conformal to the previous ones: (standard) static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach essentially reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for multiple classical spacetimes: Reissner-Nordstrom (including Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.
3728	This paper presents a new approach to the study of infinite-dimensional zero-divisor spaces by introducing a bit-string-driven recipe theory. The theory is based on the notion of placeholder substructures, which provides a flexible framework for constructing and manipulating zero-divisor spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several examples of infinite-dimensional zero-divisor spaces, including those arising in algebraic geometry and functional analysis. Our results show that the bit-string-driven recipe theory provides a powerful tool for studying the properties of these spaces and offers insights into their underlying structures. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing research in the field of zero-divisor spaces and offers new avenues for future investigations.
D2-2	Spermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood.
D2-56	Metabolic engineering is a specialized field that focuses on optimizing metabolic pathways in organisms to enhance the production of desired products, such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. Applications include the development of microbes or cells capable of efficiently producing high-value compounds, improving the yield and sustainability of chemical manufacturing, and enhancing the production of bio-based materials. It also plays a key role in environmental biotechnology, such as detoxifying pollutants or remediating soil and water. Additionally, metabolic engineering is used to improve agricultural crops by enhancing their nutrient content, stress tolerance, or resistance to pests. By tailoring metabolic pathways, it enables the creation of novel therapeutic agents, advanced biofuels, and sustainable industrial processes.
603	The research paper explores the mechanisms involved in the trafficking of glutamate receptors, which are critical for synaptic transmission. The authors demonstrate that glutamate receptors are transported to synapses through multiple routes, including surface diffusion and membrane traffic. They also show that these routes work cooperatively to bring receptors to synapses. The study concludes that a combination of surface diffusion and membrane trafficking is necessary for efficient glutamate receptor trafficking and synaptic function. These findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the development of new therapies for neurological disorders.
D2-93	Metabolic engineering is not another form of classic manipulation of intermediary metabolism; rather, it is the purposeful design of metabolic networks. The metabolic engineering approach examines biochemical reactions in their entirety, rather than individually, and is concerned with the construction of novel pathways, the thermodynamic feasibility of pathways, and the location of limiting branch-point(s) and enzymatic reaction(s) in a reaction network. The ultimate goal is the construction of strains with superior yield and productivity obtained through a convergent evolutionary process. Progress has been made toward this objective within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis through the development of methodologies for the experimental determination of elasticities and flux control coefficients.
3702	This research paper investigates the coincidence of oscillations in the dipole transition and persistent current of narrow quantum rings that contain two electrons. By studying the dependence of the dipole transition and persistent current on the external magnetic field and the width of the ring, we show that the two oscillations occur simultaneously. We find that the frequency of the oscillations increases with the magnetic field, but the amplitude decreases with increasing ring width. Our results provide insight into the intricate interplay between the dipole transition and persistent current in narrow quantum rings, which could have implications for the design of future electronic devices.
D2-64	Spermidine synthase (SpdS) is an enzyme responsible for producing spermidine, a polyamine essential for cell growth and proliferation. It typically exists as a homodimer or monomer, depending on the species, and has a Rossmann-like fold common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The enzyme’s active site binds putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), with key aspartate and glutamate residues facilitating catalysis. During the reaction, SpdS transfers an aminopropyl group from dcSAM to putrescine, forming spermidine and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). This process plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis, stress response, and DNA stabilization. The enzyme ensures efficient polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular function and growth.
3655	We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
1774	In this paper we study the interaction between two-level atom and quantized single-mode field, namely, Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). The field and the atom are initially prepared in the binomial state and the excited atomic state, respectively. For this system we prove that the revival-collapse phenomenon exhibited in the atomic inversion of the standard JCM can be numerically (naturally) manifested in the evolution of the squeezing factor of the three-photon (standard) JCM provided that the initial photon-number distribution of the radiation has a smooth envelope.
2322	The research paper investigates the thermoelectric response of CeCoIn5 near a quantum critical point. The primary focus is on the effects of magnetic field and temperature on the thermoelectric properties of the material. The study reveals that the thermoelectric response near the quantum critical point is highly sensitive to both parameters. Additionally, the results suggest that the thermoelectric response is a useful probe for detecting quantum critical behavior in CeCoIn5. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the thermoelectric properties of quantum materials and their potential applications in quantum technologies.
498	In order to describe a nonuniform equilibrium mixture with an interface between two coexisting phases it is necessary to consider contributions to the Helmholtz energy which depend on the gradients of for instance the density. Van der Waals \cite{vdW/sg, vdW/translation} was the first to introduce such a term, which is very important in the interfacial region for a one-component system. Cahn & Hilliard \cite{cahnhilliard/fens/I} extended this analysis to a binary mixture by introducing gradient terms of the mol fraction. We give an systematic extension of the gradient theory to three-dimensional multi-component systems.
3211	Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3 film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite oxide hetero-interfaces.
86	This research paper presents a study of the electrical conductivity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) using the 2PI effective action. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the impact of the effective action on the electrical conductivity of QED. The paper shows that the 2PI effective action method provides a more accurate description of the electrical conductivity in QED than other traditional approaches. The significant findings of the study include the calculation of the electric conductivity for a wide range of temperatures and densities and the observation of a novel plasma mode. The research concludes that the 2PI effective action is a powerful tool for exploring the electrical conductivity of QED and can provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly interacting systems.
1297	A generalization of the Kauffman tangle algebra is given for Coxeter type Dn. The tangles involve a pole or order 2. The algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of the same type. This result extends the isomorphism between the two algebras in the classical case, which in our set-up, occurs when the Coxeter type is of type A with index n-1. The proof involves a diagrammatic version of the Brauer algebra of type Dn in which the Temperley-Lieb algebra of type Dn is a subalgebra.
2969	This research paper investigates the coupled electron and phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions. The interplay between electrons and phonons is crucial for the understanding of thermal and electrical conductance in nanostructures. We employ density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method to study the electron and phonon transport properties of atomic junctions. Our results reveal that the electron-phonon coupling strongly affects the transport properties in atomic junctions. Specifically, we find that the coupling between the electrons and phonons can lead to a reduction in the thermal conductance and an enhancement of the electrical conductance. These findings contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the transport properties of nanostructures, and provide insight for the design of future nanoelectronic devices.
2110	A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0.001.
2590	We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory. For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.
370	We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M 2-9 and may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.
1242	"The research paper titled ""Quantisations of piecewise affine maps on the torus and their quantum limits"" explores the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus. The paper focuses on the quantisation of these maps and their corresponding quantum limits. The authors establish a connection between the classical and quantum dynamics of these maps, using tools from algebraic geometry and quantum mechanics. They show that the quantum limits of these maps are determined by their classical dynamics and provide explicit examples to illustrate their results. Overall, the paper provides a framework for understanding the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus and sheds light on the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics."
4001	We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations. We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using a current with a one point support.
2651	This research paper explores the Mpemba effect and phase transitions in the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing. The Mpemba effect is a phenomenon where hot water freezes faster than cold water under certain conditions. Adiabatic cooling, on the other hand, is the cooling of a substance without heat transfer to or from the surroundings. This study investigates the relationship between these two phenomena by examining the phase transitions that occur during the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing. The paper presents experimental data and theoretical models to explain the Mpemba effect and the phase transitions that occur in water as it cools. The findings of this study may have implications for various fields, including materials science, thermodynamics, and climatology.
1798	This research paper explores power control algorithms for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, leveraging large system analysis techniques. The study investigates the design of power control algorithms that can enhance the network's capacity and improve its performance. The paper presents several novel algorithms, and their performance is evaluated through simulations and mathematical analyses, showing significant improvements compared to existing approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms effectively manage the interference and power allocation in CDMA networks, leading to higher spectral efficiency and better quality of service. Overall, this research highlights the potential of large system analysis in developing efficient power control algorithms for CDMA networks.
2420	We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the status of fundamental physics law.
572	A trapping mechanism is observed and proposed as the origin of the anomalous behavior recently discovered in transport properties of overdamped ratchets subject to external oscillatory drive in the presence of quenched noise. In particular, this mechanism is shown to appear whenever the quenched disorder strength is greater than a threshold value. The minimum disorder strength required for the existence of traps is determined by studying the trap structure in a disorder configuration space. An approximation to the trapping probability density function in a disordered region of finite length included in an otherwise perfect ratchet lattice is obtained. The mean velocity of the particles and the diffusion coefficient are found to have a non-monotonic dependence on the quenched noise strength due to the presence of the traps.
1681	This research paper explores the concept of squashed entanglement for multipartite quantum states and proposes a method for calculating entanglement measures based on the mixed convex roof. The research finds that squashed entanglement is a useful tool for characterizing the entanglement structure of multipartite systems and provides insight into the behavior of entanglement measures in different scenarios. Additionally, the proposed method for calculating entanglement measures based on the mixed convex roof is shown to be effective in producing accurate results. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of entanglement in multipartite quantum systems and provides a framework for future investigations into this field.
2336	This research paper examines the classical nucleation theory in ordering alloys precipitating with L12 structure. The study aims to understand the fundamental principles of nucleation and growth in these alloys through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations. The results show that the classical nucleation theory can accurately describe the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern the nucleation and growth of these materials. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the effects of lattice strain and chemical composition on the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and growth of L12 precipitates in ordering alloys.
1271	This research paper investigates the impact of measurement errors and biases on the white dwarf luminosity function. The study uses a sample of white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and analyzes the effects of observational uncertainties on the derived luminosity function. The results suggest that measurement errors can significantly affect the shape of the luminosity function, leading to biases in the estimates of the white dwarf space density and the age of the Galactic disk. The study highlights the importance of accounting for measurement errors in future analyses of the white dwarf population.
3813	We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.
1990	This research paper presents a detailed investigation of the molecular structure of water and its relation with translational and orientational order. Using neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations, the study reveals the quantitative relationship between the structure of the first and second neighbor shells of water molecules. The results show that the structure of the first shell is strongly correlated with translational order, while the second shell correlates with orientational order. Furthermore, the study provides insights into the hydrogen bond network and its impact on the local structure of water. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of water, which have important implications for numerous fields, including materials science, biology, and environmental science.
999	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of harmonic generation from laser-irradiated clusters. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the mechanisms underlying the generation of high-order harmonics in clusters exposed to intense laser fields. The results show that the harmonics are generated through a combination of multiple mechanisms, including ionization, recombination, and ponderomotive acceleration. The study also shows that the harmonic spectra exhibit strong dependence on the cluster size and laser intensity. The research provides insights into the fundamental physics of high-order harmonic generation in clusters and has potential applications in attosecond science and ultrafast spectroscopy.
906	"The detection and estimation of signals in noisy, limited data is a problem of interest to many scientific and engineering communities. We present a computationally simple, sample eigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise when there are relatively few samples. We highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based detection of weak high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size and discuss its implication for the detection of two closely spaced signals. This motivates our heuristic definition of the 'effective number of identifiable signals.' Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the consistency of the algorithm with respect to the effective number of signals and the superior performance of the algorithm with respect to Wax and Kailath's ""asymptotically consistent"" MDL based estimator."
3222	This research paper provides observations on degenerate saddle point problems. The main focus is to investigate the behavior of solutions when the saddle point degenerates. The study is conducted by analyzing two numerical models, which show that the degeneracy of saddle points leads to the emergence of singularities in the solutions. The critical outcomes of this study suggest that the singularities can have a significant impact on the accuracy of numerical approximations and can affect the stability of numerical methods. The research concludes that accurate numerical methods need to be developed to handle degenerate saddle point problems effectively.
2337	We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.
108	The study focuses on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars. The researchers used numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of these fields in different rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. They found that in some cases, the poloidal magnetic fields can become unstable and create toroidal magnetic fields, which can lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field from the star. This process is known as the Tayler instability. The researchers also found that the strength of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the poloidal magnetic field. The study's outcomes suggest that poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars can be unstable and lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field, which can have significant implications for star formation and evolution.
3225	This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth, but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic. Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit, closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a function of various system parameters.
3386	Using AdS/CFT correspondence and the Euclidean action formalism for black hole entropy Kraus and Larsen have argued that the entropy of a BTZ black hole in three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry does not receive any correction from higher derivative terms in the action. We argue that as a consequence of AdS/CFT correspondence the action of a three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry cannot receive any higher derivative correction except for those which can be removed by field redefinition. The non-renormalization of the entropy then follows as a consequence of this and the invariance of Wald's formula under a field redefinition.
1238	This research paper investigates the mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the quasi-periodic modulations that occur in radio supernovae. LBVs are massive stars that undergo sporadic eruptions, and the resulting mass loss can contribute to the formation of supernovae. The study uses radio observations of supernovae to explore the relationship between LBV mass loss and the modulation of radio emission from supernovae. The findings suggest that LBV mass loss can lead to quasi-periodic modulations in the radio emission from supernovae, providing insight into the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena. The research concludes that further studies of LBV mass loss and its effects on supernovae are necessary to fully understand the processes that lead to these events.
2557	This paper presents a study of the white dwarf binary system GD 362. Using high-resolution spectroscopy and photometric observations, we investigate the possibility of a merger event in the past of this system. We analyze the chemical composition and kinematics of the system and compare them with theoretical models of binary white dwarf mergers. Our results suggest that GD 362 is a product of a binary white dwarf merger, providing new evidence for the importance of these events in the formation and evolution of white dwarfs. The paper highlights the significance of studying binary white dwarf systems to further understand the astrophysical processes that govern the evolution of stars and the formation of compact objects.
398	The quiet Sun has been a topic of interest for solar physicists for decades. Recent studies have shown a discrepancy in G-band contrast measurements, indicating that the quiet Sun may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. In this research paper, we investigate this discrepancy in G-band contrast and explore possible explanations for the observed variations. Using high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyze G-band contrast in different regions of the quiet Sun. Our results suggest that the discrepancy in G-band contrast is related to the presence of small-scale magnetic fields and their interaction with convective motions. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the quiet Sun's magnetic field and its role in the Sun's activity cycle.
3049	This research paper explores the concept of braided quantum field theories and their symmetries. The main objective of this study is to investigate the mathematical structures of these theories and understand how their symmetries behave. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the braided quantum field theories and their relevant properties, including the braiding statistics of particles and their topological invariants. The study also explores the symmetries of these theories, such as their gauge symmetries and the relations between them. The key findings of this research paper suggest that braided quantum field theories possess rich mathematical structures, and their symmetries play a crucial role in understanding their properties. These findings could have significant implications for the development of new theoretical frameworks for describing complex physical phenomena in quantum systems.
1248	This research paper presents an ab initio density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic structure of barium titanate (BaTiO3). The study investigates the electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and electronic charge density distribution of BaTiO3. The results show that BaTiO3 has a direct band gap of 3.41 eV, and the electronic charge density is mainly distributed between the Ti and O atoms. The study also confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3, which can significantly affect its electronic properties. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of BaTiO3 and its potential applications in electronic devices.
1843	Considering a separable and purely kinetic 5D scalar field on a warped product metric background we propose a new and more general approach for inducing 4D scalar potentials on a 4D constant foliation of the 5D space-time. We obtain an induced potential for a true 4D scalar field instead of a potential for an effective 4D scalar field. In this formalism we can recover the usual 4D inflationary formalism with a geometrically induced inflationary potential. In addition the quantum confinement of the inflaton modes is obtained naturally from the model for at least a class of warping factors. Besides the 4D inflationary physics that results of this formalism is independent of the 4D-hypersurface chosen.
454	"The research paper titled ""Improving Estimates of Monotone Functions by Rearrangement"" presents a novel approach to improve the estimation of monotone functions in the presence of noise.

Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of function estimation and has important implications for various applications such as signal processing, machine learning, and finance."
1478	We study the magnetotransport in small hybrid junctions formed by high-mobility GaInAs/InP heterostructures coupled to superconducting (S) and normal metal (N) terminals. Highly transmissive superconducting contacts to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) located in a GaInAs/InP heterostructure are realized by using a Au/NbN layer system. The magnetoresistance of the S/2DEG/N structures is studied as a function of dc bias current and temperature. At bias currents below a critical value, the resistance of the S/2DEG/N structures develops a strong oscillatory dependence on the magnetic field, with an amplitude of the oscillations considerably larger than that of the reference N/2DEG/N structures. The experimental results are qualitatively explained by taking Andreev reflection in high magnetic fields into account.
105	It was presented by Cabello and Nakamura [A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 190401 (2003)], that the Kochen-Specker theorem applies to two dimensions if one uses Positive Operator-Valued Measures. We show that contextuality in their models is not of the Kochen-Specker type. It is rather the result of not keeping track of the whole system on which the measurement is performed. This is connected to the fact that there is no one-to-one correspondence between POVM elements and projectors on the extended Hilbert space and the same POVM element has to originate from two different projectors when used in Cabello's and Nakamura's models. Moreover, we propose a hidden-variable formulation of the above models.
D2-75	"The Big Bang theory is an effort to explain what happened at the very beginning of our universe. Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing; during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment. According to the standard theory, our universe sprang into existence as ""singularity"" around 13.7 billion years ago. What is a ""singularity"" and where does it come from? Well, Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of ""black holes."""
2439	This research paper explores the phenomenon of spherically symmetrical accretion in fractal media, which has been poorly understood until now. The primary theme of the research revolves around the mathematical analysis of accretion in fractal media and its implications for the evolution of astrophysical objects. The study finds that the fractal dimension of the medium plays a vital role in determining the accretion rate and the final mass of the accreting body. The research also provides insights into the dynamics of accretion disks and the formation of jets in fractal media. Overall, the study highlights the importance of fractal geometry in understanding accretion processes and suggests new avenues for future research.
3224	This research paper explores the challenges and potential solutions for finding fast paths in large-scale dynamic road networks. With the exponential growth of urban populations and increasing demand for efficient transportation, it has become critical to develop algorithms that can quickly calculate the fastest routes in dynamic road networks. The paper analyzes existing methods for fast pathfinding and proposes a novel approach that utilizes a combination of heuristics, machine learning, and real-time data processing. The proposed method is tested on real-world datasets and compared with existing approaches, demonstrating superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of more efficient transportation systems and could lead to improvements in traffic management and congestion reduction.
596	We present experimental results on the relaxation dynamics of vesicles subjected to a time-dependent elongation flow. We observed and characterized a new instability, which results in the formation of higher order modes of the vesicle shape (wrinkles), after a switch in the direction of the gradient of the velocity. This surprising generation of membrane wrinkles can be explained by the appearance of a negative surface tension during the vesicle deflation, due to compression in a sign-switching transient. Moreover, the formation of buds in the vesicle membrane has been observed in the vicinity of the dynamical transition point.
2884	We study birational maps with empty base locus defined by almost complete intersection ideals. Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality of two Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method of their calculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension two the structure of the irreducible ideals leads naturally to the calculation of Sylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 we produce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The results answer affirmatively some questions raised by D. Cox.
2203	This research paper focuses on the development of a transaction-oriented simulation model for ad hoc grids. The model is designed to simulate the behavior of transactions in the ad hoc grid environment and evaluate the performance of different scheduling algorithms. The results of the simulation indicate that a priority-based scheduling algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of transaction completion time, resource utilization, and fairness. Additionally, the simulation model provides a platform for further research on ad hoc grid scheduling algorithms and can help in the design and optimization of ad hoc grid systems.

It also presents recent advances in PLNC research, including the use of multiple antennas, cooperative relaying, and coding schemes. The paper concludes with a discussion on future research directions and challenges for the widespread adoption of PLNC in wireless networks. This research paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners interested in PLNC and its potential impact on wireless network performance.
D1-1	The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
1170	We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.
3904	A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.
2770	This research paper investigates Compton scattering of Fe K alpha lines in magnetic cataclysmic variables. The study utilizes observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze the Fe K alpha lines in these systems and determine their scattering properties. The results demonstrate that magnetic cataclysmic variables show a significant amount of Compton scattering, which can affect the observed spectra. This finding has important implications for understanding the physical processes occurring in these systems and interpreting their X-ray emission. The conclusions of this study highlight the need for more detailed modeling of Compton scattering in magnetic cataclysmic variables to accurately interpret X-ray observations.
3174	Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.
2618	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of reversed flow at low frequencies in a microfabricated AC electrokinetic pump. The study demonstrates that the flow reversal is a result of the interplay between the electroosmotic and induced-charge electroosmotic flows. The authors present experimental results and theoretical analysis to explain the underlying physics of the phenomenon. The research provides insights into the design and optimization of microfluidic devices that use AC electrokinetic pumping. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of the findings in areas such as drug delivery and lab-on-a-chip devices.
1808	Shear zone formation is investigated in slow 3D shear flows. We simulate the linear version of the split-bottom shear cell. It is shown that the same type of wide shear zones is achieved in the presence as well as in the absence of gravity. We investigate the relaxation of the material towards a stationary flow and analyze the stress and the velocity fields. We provide the functional form of the widening of the shear zone inside the bulk. We discuss the growth of the region where the material is in critical state. It is found that the growth of the critical zone is responsible for the initial transient of the shear zone.
2132	This paper investigates the spheroidal and torsional modes of quasistatic shear oscillations in solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics. The study utilizes mathematical models to analyze the behavior of these modes and their impact on the internal structure and dynamics of these systems. The research aims to provide a better understanding of the fundamental physical principles that govern these phenomena and their potential applications in the field of astrophysics. The findings offer insights into the behavior of shear oscillations and their role in the formation and evolution of pulsars and other celestial bodies.
2641	The time dependent entropy (or Leipnik's entropy) of harmonic and damped harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave function obtained by the Feynman path integral method. Our results for simple harmonic oscillator are in agrement with the literature. However, the joint entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the general properties of the envelop of the joint entropy curve for quantum systems.
3708	"The paper ""A Universality in PP-Waves"" explores the concept of universality in the context of particle scattering in plane wave backgrounds. The primary theme of the research is to investigate whether certain properties of particle scattering in plane wave backgrounds are universal across different theories. Through extensive calculations and analysis, the authors conclude that certain aspects of particle scattering in plane wave backgrounds are indeed universal, suggesting deeper underlying principles at play. This research sheds light on the fundamental nature of particle physics and has implications for future theoretical developments."
4011	We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.
555	The mechanics of cells is strongly affected by molecular motors that generate forces in the cellular cytoskeleton. We develop a model for cytoskeletal networks driven out of equilibrium by molecular motors exerting transient contractile stresses. Using this model we show how motor activity can dramatically increase the network's bulk elastic moduli. We also show how motor binding kinetics naturally leads to enhanced low-frequency stress fluctuations that result in non-equilibrium diffusive motion within an elastic network, as seen in recent \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo} experiments.
1402	"The research paper titled ""Solar Magnetic Tracking. I. Software Comparison and Recommended Practices"" discusses the comparison of various software programs used for tracking the movement of magnetic fields on the Sun's surface. The main objective of the study was to determine the best practices and techniques for accurately tracking the movement of these magnetic fields. The researchers found that the most accurate results were obtained when using a combination of software programs, including SSWIDL and IDL. They also recommended that users should perform regular calibration tests and adjust their tracking techniques as needed to maintain accuracy. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of using reliable software and following recommended practices for tracking solar magnetic fields."
2212	We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.
3472	The refractive index of a dielectric medium comprising both passive and inverted components in its permittivity was determined using two methods: (i) in the time domain, a finite-difference algorithm to compute the frequency-domain reflectance from reflection data for a pulsed plane wave that is normally incident on a dielectric half-space, and (ii) in the frequency domain, the deflection of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam on transmission through a dielectric slab. The dielectric medium was found to be an active medium with a negative real part for its refractive index. Thereby, a recent controversy in the scientific literature was resolved.
2642	This research paper aims to investigate the time dependence of joint entropy of oscillating quantum systems. The joint entropy is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in a system, and understanding its behavior over time is crucial for analyzing complex quantum systems. The study will utilize mathematical models to simulate the behavior of oscillating quantum systems and examine how the joint entropy evolves over time. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of quantum information theory and help to shed light on the dynamics of complex quantum systems.
883	This research paper explores the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which are solutions to Einstein's field equations and describe the expansion of the universe. The paper focuses on the mathematical properties of these static forms and derives the necessary conditions for their existence. The main conclusion of the paper is that the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes are limited to specific cases, and that the majority of these spacetimes are expanding or contracting. This research provides valuable insights into the nature of the universe and the mathematical structure of Einstein's theory of general relativity.
265	We study the computation of the static quark potential under decimations in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG). Employing a multi-representation plaquette action, we find that fine-tuning the decimation prescription so that the MCRG equilibrium self-consistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances. In particular, lattice coarsening (change of effective lattice spacing on action-generated lattices after decimation) is nearly eliminated. Failure to correctly tune the decimation, on the other hand, produces large coarsening effects, of order 50% or more, consistent with those seen in previous studies. We also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances, where no particular improvement is seen for this action.
3053	This research paper focuses on the photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5466, specifically on the characterization of its red giants and blue stragglers. Using data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster and identify the different populations of stars. Our results show a clear separation between the red giants and blue stragglers, with the latter being more concentrated towards the center of the cluster. We also investigate the possible formation mechanisms of these stars and discuss their implications for our understanding of globular cluster evolution. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the properties and dynamics of NGC 5466, and contributes to the broader field of stellar astrophysics.
3	The paper presents an efficient centralized binary multicast network coding algorithm for any cyclic network. The proposed algorithm aims to optimize network performance by minimizing the number of transmissions required for multicast messages to reach their intended destinations in a cyclic network. The algorithm employs network coding techniques that combine multiple packets into a single transmission, thereby reducing network congestion and improving bandwidth utilization. The proposed algorithm is designed to operate in a centralized manner, which enables network administrators to efficiently manage network resources. The algorithm is evaluated through simulations, and the results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solutions. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of the proposed algorithm for improving the efficiency and reliability of multicast communications in cyclic networks.
866	We survey the few exact results on the Stormer problem describing the dynamics of charged particles in the Earth magnetosphere. The analysis of this system leads to the the conclusion that charged particles are trapped in the Earth magnetosphere or escape to infinity, and the trapping region is bounded by a torus-like surface, the Van Allen inner radiation belt. In the trapping region, the motion of the charged particles can be periodic, quasi-period or chaotic. The three main effects observed in the Earth magnetosphere, radiation belts, radiation aurorae and South Atlantic anomaly, are described in the framework described here. We discuss some new mathematical problems suggested by the analysis of the Stormer problem.
D1-21	There are three major compounds of life: proteins; lipids and carbohydrates. The perception of sweet taste, mainly associated with advantageous food, has had an important evolutionary influence on different physiological regulation mechanisms. During human development, sugar was always luxury. In 1885 Constantin Fahlberg produced the first artificial sweetener, saccharin, and the scientific establishment was surprised by its extreme sweetness. Significant to this discovery was the fact that sweet taste became affordable to poor people. Following the commercial success of artificial sweeteners, a battle between the sugar and sweetener industries began. Saccharin was claimed to be carcinogenic in rats. However, it was later shown that saccharin is neither toxic nor carcinogenic in normal amounts, yet its reputation remains tarnished.
3687	This research paper aims to investigate the phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics. Gaussian-core models are commonly used in the study of liquid crystals and exhibit a unique range of behavior compared to typical hard sphere models. The paper utilizes computer simulations to examine the phase behavior of Gaussian-core nematics as a function of temperature and density. The results of the simulations demonstrate the existence of multiple phases, including nematic and smectic phases, and provide insight into the structural and dynamic properties of the system. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the behavior of Gaussian-core nematics and have important implications for the design and development of new liquid crystal materials.
1935	This research paper presents Swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, along with 1D hydrodynamical models of wind-driven shocks. The observations were conducted using the Swift satellite, and the models were developed to better understand the dynamics of the outburst. The results demonstrate that wind-driven shocks likely play a key role in the outburst of RS Ophiuchi, and that further studies of such shocks could lead to a better understanding of the physics of novae. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the Swift satellite is a valuable tool for studying novae and other astrophysical phenomena.
3085	This research paper proposes a hierarchical approach for dependability analysis of a commercial cache-based RAID storage architecture. The aim is to identify potential failures in the system and evaluate their impact on the overall performance of the storage system. The proposed approach involves the use of fault tree analysis and Markov models to analyze the system's dependability at different levels of abstraction. The results obtained from the analysis show that the proposed approach is effective in identifying potential failures and their impact on the system's performance. The approach can also be used to optimize the system's design and improve its overall dependability.
2626	"The research paper titled ""Comment on 'Mass and Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD'"" presents a critical analysis of a recent study on the properties of the lowest resonance in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The primary theme of the paper is to examine the methodology used in the original study and to provide alternative calculations to support or refute the findings. The authors conclude that while the original study provides interesting insights into the behavior of the resonance, there are limitations to the methodology used that need to be addressed. The paper highlights the importance of careful analysis and open discussion in advancing our understanding of QCD resonances."
908	"It is a common assumption that quantum systems with time reversal invariance and classically chaotic dynamics have energy spectra distributed according to GOE-type of statistics. Here we present a class of systems which fail to follow this rule. We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time reversal symmetry and ""almost"" chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution is of GUE-type. The effect is due to the lack of ergodicity in the ""momentum"" part of the phase space and, as we argue, is generic in two dimensions. Besides, we show that certain billiards of constant width in multiply connected domains are of interest in relation to the quantum ergodicity problem. These billiards are quantum ergodic, but not classically ergodic."
2153	This research paper investigates axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria with incompressible flows under side conditions. The study aims to explore the effects of side conditions on the stability of MHD equilibria. The research employs analytical and numerical methods to analyze the equilibrium equations.

The study also reveals that the incompressible flows play a crucial role in the formation and stability of MHD equilibria. The research provides valuable insights into the behavior of MHD equilibria and offers potential applications in plasma physics and astrophysics.
714	This research paper investigates the impact of external fields, hydrostatic pressure, and impurities on a rectangular potential barrier. The study employs theoretical analysis and simulations to assess the changes in the barrier's characteristics under varying conditions. The outcomes indicate that the barrier's height and width are significantly affected by the external fields and hydrostatic pressure, while impurities have a negligible impact. The study also highlights the potential use of these findings in developing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the fundamental physics of potential barriers and provides insights into their practical applications.
1708	In this paper we derive some new and practical results on testing and interval estimation problems for the population eigenvalues of a Wishart matrix based on the asymptotic theory for block-wise infinite dispersion of the population eigenvalues. This new type of asymptotic theory has been developed by the present authors in Takemura and Sheena (2005) and Sheena and Takemura (2007a,b) and in these papers it was applied to point estimation problem of population covariance matrix in a decision theoretic framework. In this paper we apply it to some testing and interval estimation problems. We show that the approximation based on this type of asymptotics is generally much better than the traditional large-sample asymptotics for the problems.
2068	This research paper investigates the temperature dependence of the electronic properties of a quasi-one-dimensional quarter-filled band system. The transition from the Wigner crystal phase to the Bond-Charge-Density wave phase is studied as a function of temperature using numerical simulations. The results suggest that the transition occurs at a critical temperature, which decreases with increasing system size. The paper provides insights into the underlying physics of the phase transition and its dependence on temperature and system size, which may have implications for the design of novel materials with tailored electronic properties.
1868	We find exact solutions to the Dirac equation in D-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Using these solutions we analytically calculate the de Sitter quasinormal (QN) frequencies of the Dirac field. For the massive Dirac field this computation is similar to that previously published for massive fields of half-integer spin moving in four dimensions. However to calculate the QN frequencies of the massless Dirac field we must use distinct methods in odd and even dimensions, therefore the computation is different from that already known for other massless fields of integer spin.
1856	This research paper explores the concept of light logics and optimal reduction in the context of propositional logic. The authors investigate the completeness and complexity of these logics and their reduction techniques. They prove that light logics are complete with respect to polynomial time reductions, and that optimal reductions can be computed in polynomial time. The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of light logics and optimal reductions, showing that they are both NP-complete. These results have significant implications for the development of efficient algorithms for propositional logic and related fields.
3334	A complete thermodynamical analysis of the 2+1 dimensional massless Gross-Neveu model is performed using the optimized perturbation theory. This is a non-perturbative method that allows us to go beyond the known large-N results already at lowest order. Our results, for a finite number of fermion species, N, show the existence of a tricritical point in the temperature and chemical potential phase diagram for discrete chiral phase transition allowing us to precisely to locate it. By studying the phase diagram in the pressure and inverse density plane, we also show the existence of a liquid-gas phase, which, so far, was unknown to exist in this model. Finally, we also derive N dependent analytical expressions for the fermionic mass, critical temperature and critical chemical potential.
3770	Soft modes and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in Zn(CN)2 have been investigated using Raman spectroscopy and first principles calculations. The results show that Zn(CN)2 exhibits anisotropic NTE, which is attributed to the softening of specific phonon modes. Theoretical calculations and Raman spectroscopy provide complementary evidence for the existence of these soft modes. The study also highlights the importance of considering crystal anisotropy in understanding NTE in Zn(CN)2. These findings provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of NTE in molecular materials and offer potential applications in thermal management.
4052	This research paper investigates the fusion process using preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The study focuses on the dynamics of nuclear collisions and the role of the preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in the fusion process. The theoretical framework of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory is used to analyze the time evolution of the nuclear system during the fusion process. Results obtained from this study provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the fusion process and can contribute to the development of more accurate models for predicting fusion cross-sections in nuclear reactions.
3501	"The research paper ""Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking"" focuses on exploring the effects of D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking scenarios. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the resulting mass spectra for both the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and identifies the regions of parameter space where the D-term contributions are significant. The remarkable finding of the study is that D-term SUSY breaking can significantly alter the mass spectra of the MSSM, leading to non-standard phenomenology that can be probed at future collider experiments. The study concludes that incorporating D-term SUSY breaking in gauge mediation scenarios can lead to a richer and more diverse set of phenomenological signatures that can shed light on the fundamental nature of supersymmetry."
713	In this work the influence of the electric and magnetic fields over a tunneling particle in a rectangular potential barrier is shown, we have taken into account the presence of an impurity at the barrier center and the effects of a hydrostatic pressure parallel to the barrier height considering the BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions. Given that the particle is moving inside a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heterostructures it is evident a change in the transmission coefficient due to the impurity concentration and the presence of the hydrostatic pressure. The potential due to the presence of the impurity is approximate with a second degree polynomial function that resolves the discontinuity generated by heavily modifying the transmission coefficient.
950	Quantum coherence is the foundation of quantum computing, but it is easily destroyed by environmental noise. Decoherence control is a critical issue in quantum information processing. In this research paper, we propose a universal dynamical decoherence control scheme for both single-qubit and multi-qubit systems. We use a combination of dynamical decoupling and error-correcting codes to mitigate the effects of noise. Our results show that our scheme can effectively enhance the coherence of quantum systems, even in the presence of strong noise. This approach has broad applicability and can be used for a wide range of qubit systems. Our research demonstrates the promise of dynamical decoherence control for quantum information processing and paves the way for practical quantum computing applications.
231	In the purely affine formulation of gravity, the gravitational field is represented by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor of the affine connection. The classical electromagnetic field can be represented in this formulation by the second Ricci tensor of the connection. Such a construction is dynamically equivalent to the sourceless Einstein-Maxwell equations. We generalize this construction to the case with sources, represented by the derivative of the affine Lagrangian density with respect to the connection. We show that the Maxwell equations with sources emerge for the simplest affine Lagrangian for matter, while the Einstein and Lorentz equations arise if mass has electromagnetic origin. We also show that the Maxwell equations replace the unphysical constraint imposed by the projective invariance of purely affine Lagrangians that depend explicitly on the connection.
2604	The study focuses on the SW Sex-type nova-like BH Lyncis in its high state using photometry techniques. The main objective is to investigate the nature and behavior of this star system during its high state. The study found that the light curve of BH Lyncis shows a distinct double-wave modulation with a period of 0.062 days and an amplitude of 0.193 mag. The authors also observed significant variability in the system's brightness during the observation period and suggest that the variability may be caused by mass transfer between the two stars in the system. Overall, the study provides insight into the behavior of SW Sex-type nova-like systems and the mechanisms driving their variability.
187	"The research paper titled ""Projecting Massive Scalar Fields to Null Infinity"" presents a mathematical framework for studying the behavior of massive scalar fields in the vicinity of null infinity. The study is motivated by the need to understand the gravitational waves emitted by black hole mergers. The authors develop a formalism for projecting the scalar field onto null infinity and use it to study the asymptotic behavior of the field. They find that the field decays as a power law and identify the exponent as a function of the mass of the scalar. The results have implications for the detection of gravitational waves and the study of black hole dynamics."
2892	Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities. Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D, to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli exactly equal to seven.
262	"The research paper titled ""HD 98800: A 10-Myr-Old Transition Disk"" investigates the properties of a young star system. The main theme of the paper is to understand the evolution and properties of transition disks, which are disks of gas and dust around young stars that are thought to be in the process of forming planets. The researchers used several telescopes and instruments to study the star system HD 98800 and found that it has a transition disk that is likely around 10 million years old. The paper discusses the properties of the disk, including its size, temperature, and composition, and the implications for the formation of planets. The researchers conclude that understanding the properties of transition disks like the one around HD 98800 is critical to understanding the early stages of planet formation."
D2-54	Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations the behavior of quark and gluon propagators is studied in the Landau gauge for momenta from the deep Euclidean to the confinement regime. We find that while at short distances quarks and gluons propagate like free particles, over longer distances, of the order of a fermi, the gluon propagator is greatly enhanced as are the triple-gluon and quark-gluon couplings. These in turn suppress the propagation of massless quarks over long distances to such an extent that they have no physical particle pole, exactly as expected of a confining theory. We study the way the world changes as the number of massless flavors of quark is increased from zero.
2397	This research paper focuses on the lower bounds for the communication capacities of two-qudit unitary operations. The communication capacity of a quantum channel determines the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through the channel. In this work, we investigate the lower bounds for the communication capacity of two-qudit unitary operations, which are essential building blocks in quantum communication and computing. We provide a rigorous analysis of the lower bounds using a combination of information-theoretic and algebraic techniques. Our results shed new light on the fundamental limits of quantum communication and may have practical implications for the design of quantum communication protocols.
750	"The research paper titled ""Checking Equivalence of Quantum Circuits and States"" focuses on the problem of checking whether two given quantum circuits or states are equivalent. The authors propose a novel method called the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which can efficiently approximate any quantum circuit or state using a finite set of elementary gates. The algorithm is then used to check the equivalence of two circuits or states by comparing their approximations. The authors also provide a proof of the algorithm's correctness and analyze its time complexity. The main conclusion of the paper is that the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is an effective tool for checking the equivalence of quantum circuits and states, and can be used in a variety of applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing."
1338	The research paper presents the results of a study of the topology of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The authors use HI data from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) to create a three-dimensional map of the LMC's HI distribution and analyze its topology using methods from algebraic topology. The main findings of the study include the identification of large-scale voids and filaments in the LMC's HI distribution and the detection of topological features such as tunnels and loops. The authors conclude that the LMC's HI distribution is consistent with a hierarchical structure formed by gravitational collapse and that the topological analysis provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies.

This paper's critical outcome is the discovery of new ultra-hyperbolic metrics, which can aid in the development of new mathematical models in physics and mathematics.
2943	Photon splitting is a phenomenon that occurs in the presence of a strong laser field. In this process, a single photon is split into two photons with lower energies. The study of this process is of great interest in the field of quantum optics and has potential applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we investigate the conditions required for photon splitting to occur and the resulting properties of the split photons. We also discuss the potential applications of this process in the development of quantum technologies. Our findings suggest that photon splitting may be a promising avenue for the creation of entangled photon pairs and the generation of non-classical states of light.

The paper proposes a novel approach to determining the deterministic behavior of stochastic genetic circuits based on the analysis of the circuit's underlying structure. The study found that the deterministic behavior of stochastic genetic circuits can be predicted based on the topology of the circuit. The results suggest that the proposed approach can be used to design more robust genetic circuits that have predictable behavior. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of understanding the deterministic behavior of stochastic genetic circuits for the development of effective synthetic biology applications.
559	This research paper focuses on the origin of the work function, which is a fundamental concept in the field of solid-state physics. The work function is the energy required to remove an electron from a solid material, and its value plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of electronic devices. The paper reviews the historical development of the concept of work function and discusses various theories that have been proposed to explain its origin. The authors argue that the work function is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors such as the electronic structure of the material, its surface characteristics, and the presence of impurities. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the origin of the work function in designing and optimizing electronic devices.
2671	This research paper explores the preparation and detection of magnetic quantum phases in optical superlattices. The authors investigate the behavior of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice that is generated by interfering laser beams. Using a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, they demonstrate the emergence of a magnetic quantum phase with long-range order in the lattice. This phase is characterized by the appearance of a spin density wave, which can be detected using a variety of techniques. The authors conclude that optical superlattices offer a promising platform for studying magnetic quantum phases and could have potential applications in quantum information processing and sensing.
D2-25	"Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, both essential to our understanding of strong nuclear forces, yet they differ in several key ways. Fundamental Nature Quarks are elementary fermions that serve as the building blocks of hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other composite particles). Six ""flavors"" exist: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. In contrast, gluons are gauge bosons that mediate the strong force between quarks, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. Properties Quarks possess fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3), mass, spin-1/2, and color charge. Gluons are massless, have spin-1, carry no electric charge, but uniquely possess both color and anticolor charges."
3004	"The research paper titled ""Coherent control of atomic tunneling"" explores the concept of controlling the quantum tunneling of atoms using coherent light. The central theme of the paper is to investigate the ability to manipulate the tunneling rate of an atom by applying an external electromagnetic field. The study found that by applying an oscillating field, the tunneling rate of the atom could be significantly altered. The authors also discovered that by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of the field, they could control the direction and speed of the tunneling process. The paper concludes that this technique could have significant implications for future quantum computing and for the development of new technologies in the field of atomic physics."
1152	We provide an epistemological analysis of the developments of relativistic cosmology from 1917 to 2006, based on the seminal articles by Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lemaitre, Hubble, Gamow and other main historical figures of the field. It appears that most of the ingredients of the present-day standard cosmological model, such as the accelation of the expansion due to a repulsive dark energy, the interpretation of the cosmological constant as vacuum energy or the possible non-trivial topology of space, had been anticipated by Lemaitre, although his papers remain desperately unquoted.
D1-25	Although the earliest life seems to have arisen quite soon in Earth’s history, less than 800 million years after its formation, simple forms continued for 1.6 billion years until the multicellular Francevillian biota developed and quickly died out about 2.1 billion years ago. After that, although multicellular forms were in existence from about 1.7 billion years ago, it was not until the Cambrian ‘explosion’ from 540–500 million years ago that multicellular life expanded and prospered. This is essentially what we know. But fossilisation is rare and early life has resulted in tiny traces  difficult to interpret. At present there are believed to be about one trillion species on Earth, less than one per cent of those which have ever lived.
3688	We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.
D2-4	Many cross sectional and prospective studies have confirmed the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese: more than 85% of people with type 2 diabetes in southeast Scotland in 2005 had a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared) of over 25. Recent evidence indicates that high waist circumference may be an even better indicator than body mass index (BMI) of increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes over a 14 year follow-up period in the nurses' health study was 49 times higher among women whose baseline BMI was >35 than among women whose baseline BMI was <22.
118	This research paper introduces a novel algorithm called the Parameter-Less Self-Organizing Map (PLSOM) that eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning in self-organizing maps (SOMs). The PLSOM algorithm utilizes a dynamic learning rate and neighborhood function to adapt to the data distribution and achieve superior performance compared to traditional SOMs. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PLSOM algorithm in preserving the topology of high-dimensional data. The study concludes that PLSOM can serve as a promising tool for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
3746	This research paper investigates the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and star formation in the host galaxy of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf quasar. Using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, the study found a strong correlation between PAH emission and star formation rate. The results also suggest that the Cloverleaf quasar s host galaxy is undergoing a phase of intense star formation, which is likely triggered by mergers or interactions with neighboring galaxies. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between quasar activity and star formation in distant galaxies.
872	Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can send signals over more than 100 km standard optical fiber and are widely believed to be secure. Here, we show experimentally for the first time a technologically feasible attack, namely the time-shift attack, against a commercial QKD system. Our result shows that, contrary to popular belief, an eavesdropper, Eve, has a non-negligible probability (~4%) to break the security of the system. Eve's success is due to the well-known detection efficiency loophole in the experimental testing of Bell inequalities. Therefore, the detection efficiency loophole plays a key role not only in fundamental physics, but also in technological applications such as QKD.
D2-9	There are two types of diabetes: type 1, where your body is unable to make insulin; and type 2, where your body is unable to properly use the insulin it makes. When your body doesn't have enough insulin, you can't move glucose from your blood to the cells, and then you don't get the nutrients your body needs for energy. Type 2 diabetes is also often genetic, as in my case. The fact that there's no break from the disease. I have diabetes 24/7, 365 days a year. Managing what I eat is a constant challenge, especially when there are potato chips nearby. And honestly, I hate cooking and I'm always looking for easy recipes.
1656	"Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual lenses to characterize what is important in mathematics. Originally the main lenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our focus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory is laid by first showing that the object-to-object ""heteromorphisms"" between the objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to group map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic theory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the heteromorphisms between the objects of different categories."
1584	Charge redistribution at interfaces is crucial for electronic applications of high-Tc superconductors, since the band structure is modified on a local scale. We address the normal-state electronic structure of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) at an YBCO-metal contact by first principles calculations for prototypical interface configurations. We derive quantitative results for the intrinsic doping of the superconducting CuO2 planes due to the metal contact. Our findings can be explained in terms of a band-bending mechanism, complemented by local screening effects. We determine a net charge transfer of 0.09 to 0.13 electrons in favour of the intraplane Cu sites, depending on the interface orientation.
2042	Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course, we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices (ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.
3774	"The research paper ""Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data"" presents a method to construct effective interatomic potentials for quasicrystals using ab-initio data. The main theme of the paper is to provide a practical approach for the study of quasicrystals by developing simplified models that can be used to accurately predict their properties and behavior. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing the results of simulations using the effective potentials to those obtained from the ab-initio calculations. They conclude that their method is a promising tool for the study of quasicrystals and can lead to a better understanding of their unique properties."
1189	"The research paper titled ""Predicting the connectivity of primate cortical networks from topological and spatial node properties"" focuses on understanding the patterns of connectivity in primate cortical networks. The study found that there is a strong relationship between the spatial location of cortical nodes and their connectivity patterns, with nodes that are closer together tending to have more connections. Additionally, the study found that certain topological features of the network, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, were also predictive of connectivity patterns. Overall, the study suggests that both spatial and topological properties are important in understanding the organization of primate cortical networks and may have implications for understanding brain function and dysfunction."
D2-15	There are an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the known Universe, some will hold millions and others will hold billions of stars. Most of the stars will have various amounts of planets in orbit around them and trillions of those planets will be in the Goldilocks Zone, which is an area in space that has the right conditions for liquid water to exist. So the logical thing you might say is “There must be life on some of them”. Maybe some other intelligent life form on a faraway world is asking that same question. If we are alone that would make us more special and unique than we could ever imagine.
D2-79	Greenland is as old as the rest of the earth. And it has no other name than Grønland or Grœnland both of which translate and even sound close to Greenland. The very first humans there were Vikings or Norse, which as government evolved became Denmark. Norway and Denmark, Iceland and Faroe Islands, even areas of England and Scotland ruled by Vikings came under a united Denmark. The story is Ingólgur Arnason wanted to discourage more people coming so named his discovery Iceland, but Eric the Red wanting to encourage settlers named his discovery Greenland although Greenland is more appropriate for Iceland and Iceland more appropriate for Greenland. Just consider them early examples of 5th Avenue Advertizing.
1610	Coupled-mode systems are used in physical literature to simplify the nonlinear Maxwell and Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a small periodic potential and to approximate localized solutions called gap solitons by analytical expressions involving hyperbolic functions. We justify the use of the one-dimensional stationary coupled-mode system for a relevant elliptic problem by employing the method of Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions in Fourier space. In particular, existence of periodic/anti-periodic and decaying solutions is proved and the error terms are controlled in suitable norms. The use of multi-dimensional stationary coupled-mode systems is justified for analysis of bifurcations of periodic/anti-periodic solutions in a small multi-dimensional periodic potential.
3997	"Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature. The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer theories. They have then listed 9 ""absolute discrepancies"" for such cancer theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out."
2912	This research paper proposes a neurodynamical model that explains the behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli. The model takes into account the interaction between brain regions and the influence of neurotransmitters. Through simulations and empirical evidence, the study shows that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex play important roles in processing aversive stimuli and regulating behavioral responses. The model also suggests that individual differences in neurotransmitter levels can modulate the behavioral response to aversive stimuli. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying aversion and suggests potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
56	The effective Lagrangian at cubic order in electromagnetic fields and vacuum birefringence is a topic of significant interest in the field of quantum electrodynamics. This research paper aims to explore the theoretical framework for deriving the effective Lagrangian at cubic order and its implications for the phenomenon of vacuum birefringence. The paper will provide a detailed analysis of the relevant mathematical and physical concepts, including the use of Feynman diagrams and perturbative expansions. The paper will also discuss the experimental evidence for vacuum birefringence and its potential applications in testing fundamental physics theories. Overall, this research paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to understand the fundamental properties of the universe through the study of quantum electrodynamics.
701	It has been recently demonstrated that the orbital velocity profile around Kerr black holes in the equatorial plane as observed in the locally non-rotating frame exhibits a non-monotonic radial behaviour. We show here that this unexpected minimum-maximum feature of the orbital velocity remains if the Kerr vacuum is generalized to the Kerr-de Sitter or Kerr-anti-de Sitter metric. This is a new general relativity effect in Kerr spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant. Assuming that the profile of the orbital velocity is known, this effect constrains the spacetime parameters.
4042	Globular clusters (GCs) are spherical groups of stars that orbit around the galactic center. The horizontal branch (HB) is a region in the HR diagram where stars are burning helium in their cores. In this study, we investigate the kinematic properties of GCs with extended HBs, using data from the Gaia mission. We discover that these GCs exhibit a kinematic decoupling, with their cores moving differently from their outer regions. We propose that this decoupling is due to the presence of multiple stellar populations with different ages and metallicities. Our results suggest that the formation and evolution of GCs are more complex than previously thought, and that the extended HB is a useful tracer of their kinematic properties.
1900	We investigate the dimerization and fusion of C60 molecules to form various C60 dimers when pushed against each other at several inter-molecular distances. We study the stability of this dimerized C60 molecule based on its binding strength provided by intramolecular interactions. Tersoff potential, which is considered to represent intramolecular interactions well, has been used to calculate potential energy at these distances of separation and for all possible orientations of the molecules. We observe that several minimum energy configurations exist at various distances between the C60 molecules. Our calculation shows that apart from the dumbbell structures, many interesting composite phases also result, such as fused, peanut and carbon nanotubes of geometry (5,5) and (10,0) of certain specific length.
1822	One of the problems concerning entanglement witnesses (EWs) is the construction of them by a given set of operators. Here several multi-qubit EWs called stabilizer EWs are constructed by using the stabilizer operators of some given multi-qubit states such as GHZ, cluster and exceptional states. The general approach to manipulate the multi-qubit stabilizer EWs by exact(approximate) linear programming (LP) method is described and it is shown that the Clifford group play a crucial role in finding the hyper-planes encircling the feasible region. The optimality, decomposability and non-decomposability of constructed stabilizer EWs are discussed.
2027	We consider a two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The variational approximation (VA) predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of 2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.
841	In this research paper, we investigate the coupling of transverse and longitudinal responses in stiff polymers using molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that this coupling is strongly influenced by the polymer's stiffness and can result in significant changes in the polymer's mechanical properties. Specifically, we show that the coupling between transverse and longitudinal responses can result in increased stiffness and strength in the polymer, which has important implications for the design of high-performance materials. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering the coupling of different response modes in the mechanical behavior of stiff polymers.
654	This research paper explores the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as a means of achieving ensemble learning for free. The study investigates several different EA-based approaches to ensemble learning, comparing their performance with traditional ensemble learning methods and analyzing the impact of various factors on their effectiveness. The results of the study show that EA-based ensemble learning can be a powerful tool for improving classification accuracy, particularly when used in conjunction with other optimization techniques. The paper concludes that EA-based ensemble learning is a promising approach for achieving improved classification accuracy in a wide range of applications.
4035	We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions. Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the driving fields.
1930	The Extended BP (EBP) Generalized EXIT (GEXIT) function introduced in \cite{MMRU05} plays a fundamental role in the asymptotic analysis of sparse graph codes. For transmission over the binary erasure channel (BEC) the analytic properties of the EBP GEXIT function are relatively simple and well understood. The general case is much harder and even the existence of the curve is not known in general. We introduce some tools from non-linear analysis which can be useful to prove the existence of EXIT like curves in some cases. The main tool is the Krasnoselskii-Rabinowitz (KR) bifurcation theorem.
1175	The d-wave pairing state is a well-known phenomenon in high-temperature superconductivity, but its microscopic origin is still a subject of intense research. In this paper, we explore the possibility of describing the d-wave pairing state in terms of Zhang-Rice singlets, which are local electronic states in transition metal oxides. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that the d-wave pairing state can indeed be understood in terms of Zhang-Rice singlets, and we discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. Our results shed light on the complex interplay between local electronic states and long-range quantum entanglement in strongly correlated systems.
248	This research paper investigates the existence and properties of symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in optical lattices. The theoretical analysis is based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the numerical simulations are performed using the split-step Fourier method. We demonstrate that symmetric solitons can exist in BECs with equal coupling strengths, while asymmetric solitons can appear in BECs with unequal coupling strengths. The stability of the solitons is also analyzed and it is found that the symmetric solitons are more stable than the asymmetric ones. Additionally, the influence of the lattice depth on the soliton properties is investigated. Our findings can be used to design and control soliton dynamics in BEC systems, which have potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurements.
126	"The research paper titled ""Support Vector Machine for Functional Data Classification"" presents a novel approach for classifying functional data. The authors propose the use of support vector machines (SVMs) as a powerful and flexible tool for functional data analysis. The paper provides a detailed description of the SVM algorithm and its application to functional data classification. The authors also compare the performance of SVMs with other classification methods commonly used in functional data analysis. The results show that SVMs outperform other methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. The paper concludes that SVMs are a promising tool for functional data classification and have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications."
2099	This research paper investigates the molecular environment of massive star forming cores that are associated with Class II methanol maser emission. The study employs observational data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to analyze the physical and chemical properties of these sources. The results suggest that the methanol maser emission is produced in dense and warm gas environments, and is likely linked to the presence of young and massive stars. The study also identifies several molecular tracers that can be used to probe the physical conditions and chemical evolution of these regions. Overall, the findings shed light on the complex processes involved in the formation of massive stars and their surrounding environments.
D2-36	"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. These compounds serve as ingredients in various everyday products, with applications ranging from industrial uses to consumer goods due to their unique water and oil-repellent properties. PFAS are often referred to as ""forever chemicals"" due to their extraordinary environmental persistence They represent persistent contaminants that are particularly challenging to address through conventional wastewater treatment processes Their persistence has made them contaminants of emerging concern in industrialized countries, where they accumulate in the environment over time. Research indicates that PFAS exposure poses significant health risks: PFAS disrupt biological membranes resulting in cellular inhibition."
1731	The effective gluon propagator constructed with the pinch technique is governed by a Schwinger-Dyson equation with special structure and gauge properties, that can be deduced from the correspondence with the background field method. Most importantly the non-perturbative gluon self-energy is transverse order-by-order in the dressed loop expansion, and separately for gluonic and ghost contributions, a property which allows for a meanigfull truncation. A linearized version of the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equation is derived, using a vertex that satisfies the required Ward identity and contains massless poles. The resulting integral equation, subject to a properly regularized constraint, is solved numerically, and the main features of the solutions are briefly discussed.
80	"The paper ""Thermal noise informatics"" explores the potential of using thermal noise to achieve secure communication through a wire, zero-power communication, and thermal noise driven computing. The authors present a theoretical framework for understanding the properties of thermal noise and its potential applications in information processing. They demonstrate the feasibility of using thermal noise as a source of randomness for encryption and decryption of messages, as well as for powering low-energy devices. The authors also discuss the potential of thermal noise as a computational resource, offering promising results in simulations of simple logic gates. Overall, the paper suggests that thermal noise has significant potential for advancing the field of information processing and communication."
3846	It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
3638	The glass transition in one-component liquids with anisotropic potential is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. In this research paper, we investigate the mechanism of glass transition using computer simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the anisotropy of the potential has a significant impact on the glass-forming ability of the liquid. We find that the glass transition occurs when the relaxation time of the liquid becomes extremely long, and the system becomes stuck in a metastable state. Moreover, we show that the dynamics of the glass transition can be described by a mode-coupling theory, which predicts the existence of a critical point separating the liquid and glass phases. Our findings provide insight into the fundamental physics of glass transition and have important implications for materials science and engineering.
3014	This research paper examines the collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market. The main objective of this study is to investigate the existence and strength of the collective behavior among stocks in the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), Pakistan. Using daily stock returns data spanning from January 2001 to December 2017, we apply the network-based methodology to analyze the interdependence and synchronization of stock returns. Our findings reveal that the KSE exhibits strong collective behavior, indicating that stock prices are highly interdependent and synchronized. Moreover, our analysis shows that this collective behavior is affected by external shocks, such as political instability and economic crises. These findings have important implications for investors, policymakers, and regulators who seek to understand the dynamics of the emerging market and develop effective investment strategies.
992	Quantized spin excitations in a single ferromagnetic microstrip have been measured using the microwave photovoltage technique. Several kinds of spin wave modes due to different contributions of the dipole-dipole and the exchange interactions are observed. Among them are a series of distinct dipole-exchange spin wave modes, which allow us to determine precisely the subtle spin boundary condition. A comprehensive picture for quantized spin excitations in a ferromagnet with finite size is thereby established. The dispersions of the quantized spin wave modes have two different branches separated by the saturation magnetization.
1382	This research paper explores the control of mechanical systems on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics. The focus is on the development of control strategies that can be applied to systems with nonlinear dynamics and complex structures. The paper presents a theoretical framework for control design using Lie group theory and provides practical examples of its application in ideal hydrodynamics. The key results indicate that the proposed control strategies are effective in stabilizing the system and achieving desired trajectories. The conclusions highlight the potential of Lie group theory as a powerful tool for control design in mechanical systems and fluid dynamics.
2256	We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries, with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls.
D1-22	Artificial sweeteners are low- or zero-calorie sugar substitutes used to sweeten foods and beverages without the added calories of sugar. Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (a natural alternative). They are widely used in diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and diabetic-friendly products. While they provide sweetness without spiking blood sugar levels, they remain controversial. Studies show they are safe in moderation, but concerns exist about potential long-term effects on gut health and metabolism. Some people experience sensitivity to specific sweeteners. Ultimately, artificial sweeteners can be helpful for reducing calorie intake, but their impact varies widely from person to person.
D2-61	Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.
2251	This research paper explores the statistical properties of many-particle eigenfunctions in a variety of physical systems. The primary focus is on understanding the behavior of these eigenfunctions and their relationship to the underlying physical properties of the system. The paper presents several key findings, including the observation that many-particle eigenfunctions tend to be highly complex and exhibit a wide range of statistical properties. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of understanding these properties in order to better predict the behavior of physical systems at the quantum level. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the statistical properties of many-particle eigenfunctions and their role in understanding complex physical systems.
366	In magnetic systems with dominating easy-plane anisotropy the magnetization can be described by an effective one dimensional equation for the in-plane angle. Re-deriving this equation in the presence of spin-transfer torques, we obtain a description that allows for a more intuitive understanding of spintronic devices' operation and can serve as a tool for finding new dynamic regimes. A surprising prediction is obtained for a planar ``spin-flip transistor'': an unstable equilibrium point can be stabilized by a current induced torque that further repels the system from that point. Stabilization by repulsion happens due to the presence of dissipative environment and requires a Gilbert damping constant that is large enough to ensure overdamped dynamics at zero current.
465	We show that finite size superconductors have a spectrum of states at extremely low energy, i.e. inside the superconducting gap. The presence of this {\it thin spectrum} is a generic feature and related to the fact that in a superconductor the global phase rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. For a strong coupling superconductor we find the spectrum by exactly solving the Lieb-Mattis type Hamiltonian onto which the problem maps. One of the physical consequences of the presence of thin states is that they cause quantum decoherence in superconducting qubits of finite extent.
633	This research paper investigates the screening masses in the SU(3) pure gauge theory and explores their potential relationship with universality. The study utilizes lattice simulations to calculate the screening masses, which are a fundamental property of the theory that describes the behavior of quark-antiquark pairs at large distances. The results demonstrate that the screening masses exhibit a universal scaling behavior, indicating a possible connection to universality. Additionally, the study examines the impact of different lattice sizes and couplings on the screening masses, providing insights into the theory's behavior under various conditions. The findings shed light on the fundamental properties of the SU(3) pure gauge theory and may have implications for our understanding of universality in gauge theories.
900	One of the main open questions in liaison theory is whether every homogeneous Cohen-Macaulay ideal in a polynomial ring is glicci, i.e. if it is in the G-liaison class of a complete intersection. We give an affirmative answer to this question for Stanley-Reisner ideals defined by simplicial complexes that are weakly vertex-decomposable. This class of complexes includes matroid, shifted and Gorenstein complexes respectively. Moreover, we construct a simplicial complex which shows that the property of being glicci depends on the characteristic of the base field. As an application of our methods we establish new evidence for two conjectures of Stanley on partitionable complexes and on Stanley decompositions.
2578	The Galactic Center is an area of intense interest for astronomers due to its unique properties and rich astrophysical phenomena. In this paper, we review recent observational and theoretical studies of the Galactic Center, focusing on its supermassive black hole, the stars orbiting it, and the complex interplay of gas and magnetic fields in the region. We discuss the latest results from telescopes and simulations, highlighting the advances in our understanding of the Galactic Center's structure, dynamics, and evolution. Our main conclusions are that the Galactic Center is a unique laboratory for testing fundamental physics, studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, and exploring the potential for life in extreme environments.
452	This research paper investigates the flow instabilities of magnetic flux tubes, focusing on longitudinal flow. In particular, we explore the effects of various parameters, such as the magnetic field strength and plasma density, on the development and behavior of these instabilities. Using numerical simulations and analytical approaches, we demonstrate that longitudinal flow can lead to complex dynamics, including the formation of waves and shocks, and can significantly impact the transport of energy and mass in the plasma. Our results have important implications for understanding the behavior of magnetic flux tubes in a range of astrophysical environments, from the solar corona to accretion disks around black holes.
3946	A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.
497	Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Z-contrast imaging we have demonstrated elongated nanostructure formation of fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) within an organic host through annealing. The annealing provides an enhanced mobility of the PCBM molecules and, with good initial dispersion, allows for the formation of exaggerated grain growth within the polymer host. We have assembled these nanostructures within the regioregular conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). This PCBM elongated nanostructure formation maybe responsible for the very high efficiencies observed, at very low loadings of PCBM (1:0.6, polymer to PCBM), in annealed photovoltaics. Moreover, our high resolution TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy studies clearly show that the PCBM crystals remain crystalline and are unaffected by the 200-keV electron beam
3886	This research paper focuses on the achievement of the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser. The primary objective of the study is to explore the fundamental limits of precision metrology using atom interferometry. The authors used a Bose-Einstein condensate of Rubidium atoms to generate a coherent matter wave and performed a series of interferometric measurements to determine the phase shift caused by a weak external force. The results show that the Heisenberg limit can be reached by optimizing the interferometric sequence and reducing the shot noise. The study also highlights the importance of using squeezed states to achieve the ultimate sensitivity. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the development of atomic sensors with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity.
3178	Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most 1.
3194	This research paper focuses on the use of atomic force microscopy and stochastic analysis to study the effect of bias voltage on the surface statistical properties of materials. The study found that by controlling the bias voltage, it is possible to manipulate the surface morphology and roughness of the material. The findings suggest that bias voltage can be used as a control parameter in surface engineering applications. The paper concludes that the combination of AFM and stochastic analysis provides a powerful tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of surface modification and designing new materials with tailored surface properties.
3436	This research paper investigates the gravitational coupling of Hadamard states, which are quantum states commonly used in the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The focus is on understanding how these states interact with gravity and how this interaction can be described mathematically. Specifically, we examine the effect of curvature on the correlation functions of Hadamard states and explore the implications of this effect for the interpretation of the states in the context of quantum gravity. The paper utilizes a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to study the behavior of Hadamard states in different gravitational backgrounds. The findings contribute to the ongoing effort to develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity that can reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity.
2406	We apply quantum filtering and control to a particle in a harmonic trap under continuous position measurement, and show that a simple static feedback law can be used to cool the system. The final steady state is Gaussian and dependent on the feedback strength and coupling between the system and probe. In the limit of weak coupling this final state becomes the ground state. An earlier model by Haine et. al. (PRA 69, 2004) without measurement back-action showed dark states: states that did not display error signals, thus remaining unaffected by the control. This paper shows that for a realistic measurement process this is not true, which indicates that a Bose-Einstein condensate may be driven towards the ground state from any arbitrary initial state.
1905	This research paper presents a novel approach to designing algebraic distributed space-time codes with low maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. The proposed codes are constructed using algebraic techniques that allow for efficient encoding and decoding, as well as low complexity ML decoding. The codes are designed for distributed antenna systems, where multiple antennas are distributed across different nodes in a network. The proposed codes are shown to achieve high data rates while maintaining low decoding complexity, making them ideal for practical applications. The performance of the proposed codes is evaluated using simulations in various network scenarios, and the results demonstrate that they outperform existing state-of-the-art codes in terms of both performance and complexity. The proposed codes provide a promising solution for high-speed and low-latency communication in distributed antenna systems.
D1-7	Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers.In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities.
1597	This research paper focuses on the van der Waals-like phase separation instability of a driven granular gas in three dimensions. The primary focus is on the behavior of the granular gas in the presence of external driving and how it affects the phase separation behavior. The study utilizes numerical simulations and analytical calculations to investigate the instability and its dependence on various parameters. The important outcomes of the study include the identification of a critical driving strength that triggers the instability, the discovery of a scaling relation between the driving strength and the characteristic length scale of the instability, and the observation of a transition from a continuous to a discontinuous phase separation. These findings provide insights into the fundamental physics of granular gases and may have practical implications for various engineering applications.
3991	An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.
566	Tracking individual nano-objets in live cells during arbitrary long times is an ubiquitous need in modern biology. We present here a method for tracking individual 5 nm gold nanoparticles on live cells. It relies on the photothermal effect and the detection of the Laser Induced Scattering around a NanoAbsorber (LISNA). The key point for recording trajectories at video rate is the use of a triangulation procedure. The effectiveness of the method is tested against Single fluorescent Molecule Tracking in live COS7 cells on subsecond time scales. We further demonstrate recordings for several minutes of AMPA receptors trajectories on the plasma membrane of live neurons. SNaPT has the unique potential to record arbitrary long trajectory of membrane proteins using non-fluorescent nanometer sized labels.
331	In this paper I am presenting an overview on several topics related to nonequilibrium fluctuations in small systems. I start with a general discussion about fluctuation theorems and applications to physical examples extracted from physics and biology: a bead in an optical trap and single molecule force experiments. Next I present a general discussion on path thermodynamics and consider distributions of work/heat fluctuations as large deviation functions. Then I address the topic of glassy dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium fluctuations due to small cooperatively rearranging regions. Finally, I conclude with a brief digression on future perspectives.
2450	Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.
3566	A simple but general microscopic mechanism to understand the interplay between the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom is developed. Within this mechanism, the magnetic structure generates an electric current which induce an counterbalance electric current from the spin orbital coupling. When the magnetic structure is described by a single order parameter, the electric polarization is determined by the single spin orbital coupling parameter, and the material is predicted to be a half insulator. This mechanism provides a simple estimation of the value of ferroelectricity and sets a physical limitation as well.
957	This research paper presents a new class of pairwise-independent joinings, which are structures that arise in probability theory and have applications in various fields, such as computer science and physics. The paper introduces a method for constructing such joinings and establishes several key properties of this class, including its relationship to other known classes of joinings. Notably, the paper proves that under certain conditions, this new class of joinings is equivalent to the class of independent joinings, which has important implications for studying probabilistic systems. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of pairwise-independent joinings and their role in probability theory.
256	"The research paper titled ""Immunohistochemical pitfalls in the demonstration of insulin-degrading enzyme in normal and neoplastic human tissues"" aims to identify and overcome the challenges in detecting insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in human tissues using immunohistochemistry. Through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic human tissues, the study reveals that the detection of IDE using immunohistochemistry is challenging due to its low expression levels and cross-reactivity with other proteins. The authors suggest using multiple antibodies and optimizing staining protocols to improve the detection of IDE in human tissues. The study concludes that caution should be exercised when interpreting IDE immunostaining results, and further research is needed to validate the specificity and sensitivity of different IDE antibodies."
2364	"This work is dedicated to a new completely algebraic approach to Arakelov geometry, which doesn't require the variety under consideration to be generically smooth or projective. In order to construct such an approach we develop a theory of generalized rings and schemes, which include classical rings and schemes together with ""exotic"" objects such as F_1 (""field with one element""), Z_\infty (""real integers""), T (tropical numbers) etc., thus providing a systematic way of studying such objects. This theory of generalized rings and schemes is developed up to construction of algebraic K-theory, intersection theory and Chern classes. Then existence of Arakelov models of algebraic varieties over Q is shown, and our general results are applied to such models."
2484	This research paper investigates the generation of curvature perturbations in the context of a multiple field ekpyrotic collapse. The main objective is to explore how the dynamics of the fields within this model affects the power spectrum of the generated perturbations. The study uses a scalar field theory and employs the delta N formalism to calculate the curvature perturbations. The results indicate that the presence of multiple fields can lead to a significant enhancement of the power spectrum, particularly at small scales. Additionally, the study finds that the introduction of a non-minimal coupling between the fields can further amplify the perturbations. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early universe and the generation of primordial perturbations.
2866	Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.
1755	"The research paper titled ""Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties"" investigates how social influence affects individuals' decision-making processes. The study proposes a mathematical model that incorporates the idea that people are influenced by the decisions of others in their social network. The authors show that under certain conditions, the model exhibits generic properties, such as a phase transition between a state of conformity and non-conformity. Additionally, they find that the degree of social influence is dependent on the size and structure of the social network. The study's findings suggest that social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual decision-making and provide insights into the factors that affect the spread of ideas and behaviors within a community."
2696	We investigate the physical property of the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.
3470	We propose a novel experiment to identify the symmetry of superconductivity on the basis of theoretical results for differential conductance of a normal metal connected to a superconductor. The proximity effect from the superconductor modifies the conductance of the remote current depending remarkably on the pairing symmetry: spin-singlet or spin-triplet. The clear-cut difference in the conductance is explained by symmetry of Cooper pairs in a normal metal with respect to frequency. In the spin-triplet case, the anomalous transport is realized due to an odd-frequency symmetry of Cooper pairs.
2916	This research paper explores the collective excitations in a magnetically doped quantized Hall ferromagnet. By utilizing the magneto-optical spectroscopy technique, we investigate the collective modes of the ferromagnet and their dependence on the magnetic field. Our results show that the collective modes can be tuned by varying the magnetic field, which suggests the possibility of controlling the magnetization dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collective modes exhibit a strong coupling with the Landau level transitions, providing insight into the underlying physics of the system. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of the collective excitations in magnetically doped quantized Hall ferromagnets and offer potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.
918	This research paper investigates the behavior of solitary and shock waves in discrete double power-law materials. The study focuses on the propagation of these waves in a one-dimensional lattice, where the material properties are described by a double power-law potential. The analysis is carried out using numerical simulations and analytical calculations. The results show that the material's nonlinearity and anisotropy significantly affect the characteristics of the waves, such as their amplitude, speed, and shape. Moreover, it is found that the presence of the double power-law potential leads to the formation of new types of waves, such as asymmetric solitary waves and oscillatory shock waves. These findings have implications for the design and control of materials with tailored mechanical properties, such as high-energy absorbing structures and impact-resistant materials.
538	This research paper focuses on investigating the Mott insulator-superfluid transition in a two-band model at finite temperature and its potential application to supersolid 4He. The study uses Monte Carlo simulations and finds that the transition is first-order and occurs below a certain critical temperature. The results suggest that the two-band model can explain some of the observed properties of supersolid 4He, such as the anomalous peak in the sound attenuation spectrum. The research has important implications for understanding the behavior of solid helium and could potentially lead to the development of new technologies.
2977	This research paper revisits the issues surrounding NetFlow sample and export performance, a critical area for network monitoring and security. The study evaluates the performance of NetFlow sampling and export mechanisms, and the impact of different sampling rates on the accuracy of flow data. The research findings indicate that increasing the sampling rate can improve the accuracy of flow data, but at the cost of increased resource consumption. The paper also proposes a new method for optimizing NetFlow sampling based on flow characteristics. The results of this study have significant implications for network administrators and security professionals who rely on NetFlow data for network monitoring and analysis.
D2-26	The global increase in demand for meat and the limited land area available prompt the search for alternative protein sources. Also the sustainability of meat production has been questioned. Edible insects as an alternative protein source for human food and animal feed are interesting in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions, high feed conversion efficiency, low land use, and their ability to transform low value organic side streams into high value protein products. More than 2000 insect species are eaten mainly in tropical regions. The role of edible insects in the livelihoods and nutrition of people in tropical countries is discussed, but this food source is threatened
D2-3	The feasibility of extraterrestrial life is a subject of intense scientific interest, supported by discoveries in astrobiology, planetary science, and extremophile research. While no direct evidence has been found, several factors suggest its plausibility. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some located in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery of extremophiles on Earth, thriving in extreme conditions such as deep-sea vents and frozen tundras, suggests that life could also adapt to harsh extraterrestrial environments like those on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus. Additionally, complex organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been detected in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, indicating that life’s fundamental chemistry is widespread.
1233	A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of a U(1) symmetry, this kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, similar to recently studied Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal nonlinear extension of quantum theory. A probabilistic interpretation (Born's rule) holds, provided the underlying model is scale free. Keywords: nonlinear functional Schroedinger equation, gauge symmetry, Newtonian gravity.
2054	The research paper investigates the magnetosphere of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 in Westerlund 1, a young massive star cluster. The authors analyze X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and find evidence of strong magnetic field activity and particle acceleration in the magnetosphere. They also observe periodic variations in the X-ray emission, which suggests a rotating magnetosphere. The findings suggest that CXOU J164710.2-455216 is a highly active magnetar with a complex magnetosphere, and that its interaction with the surrounding environment may have important implications for the evolution of the cluster.
868	A singular foliation on a complete riemannian manifold M is said to be riemannian if each geodesic that is perpendicular at one point to a leaf remains perpendicular to every leaf it meets. We prove that the regular leaves are equifocal, i.e., the end point map of a normal foliated vector field has constant rank. This implies that we can reconstruct the singular foliation by taking all parallel submanifolds of a regular leaf with trivial holonomy. In addition, the end point map of a normal foliated vector field on a leaf with trivial holonomy is a covering map. These results generalize previous results of the authors on singular riemannian foliations with sections.
2379	This research paper explores the formation of vortices through the merging and interference of multiple trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of the condensates and their interactions with each other. The results show that the merging of condensates can lead to the formation of vortex rings, while interference between them can produce more complex vortex structures. The study also highlights the importance of the initial conditions and trap geometry in determining the resulting vortex patterns. The findings provide insights into the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates in complex systems and may have implications for the development of future quantum technologies.

These findings contribute to our understanding of black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and other astrophysical events that produce gravitational waves. Overall, this research has significant implications for the field of astrophysics and may lead to further discoveries in the future.
2471	"This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions."
948	This research paper explores the characteristics and behavior of Blazhko RR Lyrae stars using observations from the 24-inch telescope at the Konkoly Observatory. The study reveals that these stars exhibit cyclic variations in their brightness and pulsation periods, and the amplitudes of the variations may change over time. The findings suggest that the Blazhko effect may be caused by non-radial pulsations or magnetic fields in the stars. Overall, this research provides insight into the complex nature of RR Lyrae stars and their potential use as standard candles in cosmological distance measurements.
2372	Kontsevitch's work on Airy matrix integrals has led to explicit results for the intersection numbers of the moduli space of curves. In a subsequent work Okounkov rederived these results from the edge behavior of a Gaussian matrix integral. In our work we consider the correlation functions of vertices in a Gaussian random matrix theory, with an external matrix source, in a scaling limit in which the powers of the matrices and their sizes go to infinity simultaneously in a specified scale. We show that the replica method applied to characteristic polynomials of the random matrices, together with a duality exchanging N and the number of points, allows one to recover Kontsevich's results on the intersection numbers, through a simple saddle-point analysis.
2928	This research paper focuses on the connection between proto-neutron star winds, magnetar birth, and gamma-ray bursts. The study aims to explore the physical mechanisms that drive magnetar formation and the resulting gamma-ray bursts. The research utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of proto-neutron stars and their subsequent winds. The analysis reveals that the magnetar formation and the resulting gamma-ray bursts are a consequence of the proto-neutron star winds. The findings suggest that the proto-neutron star winds are crucial in the formation of magnetars and the generation of gamma-ray bursts. The results of this study provide critical insights into the physical processes that govern the formation of magnetars and the associated gamma-ray bursts.
2940	We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts. Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy, leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer.
3653	The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.
2949	"In this research paper, the authors investigate the thermal conductance of nanowires in different dimensions. They find that the thermal conductance of nanowires increases as the diameter decreases, but as the nanowires become thinner, the thermal conductance converges to the conductance of a two-dimensional sheet. This phenomenon is referred to as a ""dimensional crossover"" of thermal conductance. The authors also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of thermal conductance in nanowires of different dimensions. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of nanoscale devices that rely on thermal transport."
753	Stimulated by recent advances in isolating graphene, we discovered that quantum dot can be trapped in Z-shaped graphene nanoribbon junciton. The topological structure of the junction can confine electronic states completely. By varying junction length, we can alter the spatial confinement and the number of discrete levels within the junction. In addition, quantum dot can be realized regardless of substrate induced static disorder or irregular edges of the junction. This device can be used to easily design quantum dot devices. This platform can also be used to design zero-dimensional functional nanoscale electronic devices using graphene ribbons.
2777	The research paper aims to investigate the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices on the surfaces of four Uranian moons - Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon - using spectroscopic observations from the Infrared Telescope Facility/Spectral Energy Distribution Camera. The study found that all four moons exhibited significant variations in the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices, with Ariel and Umbriel showing the highest concentrations of CO2 ice and Titania and Oberon having the highest concentrations of H2O ice. The researchers also noted that the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices appears to be influenced by factors such as surface temperature, albedo, and geological processes like impact cratering and tectonic activity. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the surface composition and geological history of these Uranian moons.
3032	Quantum auctions are a novel application of quantum game theory that aim to improve the efficiency and security of traditional auctions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of quantum auctions and present several different protocols that have been proposed in the literature. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each protocol, and compare them to classical auctions in terms of efficiency, fairness, and resistance to fraud and collusion. Our findings suggest that quantum auctions have the potential to revolutionize the auction industry by providing more secure and efficient mechanisms for allocating resources. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this emerging technology and to develop practical implementations that can be used in real-world settings.
2125	We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound state in cosmic string background may lead to the so called anomalous scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular physics.
1789	The research paper investigates the role of nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering on the density of states (DOS) and supercurrent in diffusive SNS junctions. The study reveals that the DOS is significantly affected by the presence of nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering, which can lead to a reduction in the critical current of the junction. The results also suggest that the spin-flip scattering can cause a significant reduction in the supercurrent at higher temperatures. The study provides insights into the role of interface properties and spin scattering on the transport properties of SNS junctions, which can be useful in designing and optimizing superconducting devices.
480	The accurate modeling of peptides is crucial for understanding biological processes and developing new drugs. In this research paper, we explore efficient model chemistries for peptides using split-valence Gaussian basis sets and the heterolevel approximation in both restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and second-order M ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). We demonstrate that the heterolevel approximation can significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining high accuracy in RHF calculations. Additionally, we show that the use of split-valence basis sets can improve the accuracy of MP2 calculations while also reducing the computational cost. Overall, our findings suggest that these model chemistries can provide efficient and accurate simulations of peptides, making them valuable tools for drug discovery and other biochemical applications.
570	We performed a visualization of membrane proteins labeled with 10-nm gold nanoparticles in cells, using an all-optical method based on photothermal interference contrast. The high sensitivity of the method and the stability of the signals allows 3D imaging of individual nanoparticles without the drawbacks of photobleaching and blinking inherent to fluorescent markers. A simple analytical model is derived to account for the measurements of the signal amplitude and the spatial resolution. The photothermal interference contrast method provides an efficient, reproducible, and promising way to visualize low amounts of proteins in cells by optical means.
3218	This paper explores the intersection of geometry, quantum mechanics, and neuroscience to investigate the phenomenon known as the quantum Zeno effect. Specifically, we examine the role of the axiom of choice in the geometry of time and its implications for the neuro-biological basis of the quantum Zeno effect. Using mathematical models and empirical evidence from neuroscientific studies, we argue that the quantum Zeno effect is intimately tied to the structure of time and the way in which the brain processes information. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of the geometry of time and the quantum Zeno effect could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of more powerful quantum computing technologies.
334	This research paper reports the discovery of a cold metal-poor cloud using weak MgII absorption at a redshift of z~0.45. This cloud was found to contain SiI, CaI, and FeI, which are the first detections of these elements in a QSO absorber. The authors conclude that this cloud is likely a primordial gas cloud that has not undergone significant enrichment from previous generations of stars. This finding supports current theories of the early universe and provides new insights into the evolution of galaxies and the formation of the first stars.
2517	This research paper presents a novel approach to network coding using a Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DDGA). Network coding is a technique that enables efficient data transmission over networks by allowing intermediate nodes to combine and transform data packets. However, traditional approaches to network coding can be computationally expensive and difficult to optimize. The proposed DDGA approach addresses these challenges by using a genetic algorithm that incorporates both population and individual level distributions. This allows for a more efficient and effective search for optimal network coding solutions. Simulation results show that the DDGA approach outperforms traditional genetic algorithms and other state-of-the-art network coding techniques in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of network coding in a variety of applications.
3149	This research paper presents the results of a simultaneous monitoring campaign of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005 using the Swift and REM telescopes. Blazars are a type of active galactic nuclei that exhibit extreme variability in their emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The simultaneous monitoring campaign was conducted to investigate the correlation between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar PKS0537-441. The paper presents the light curves and spectral energy distributions obtained from the joint observations and analyzes the variability patterns in both energy bands. The results show a complex interplay between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar, indicating the need for simultaneous monitoring campaigns to fully understand the physics of blazar emission.
3769	We have studied Zn(CN)2 at high pressure using Raman spectroscopy, and report Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit, with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.
3331	"The research paper ""A new spinfoam vertex for quantum gravity"" proposes a new way to compute the amplitudes of quantum gravitational interactions using a spinfoam formalism. The paper introduces a new type of vertex that is based on the geometry of the underlying space-time and incorporates the concept of causal cones. The proposed vertex is shown to have better convergence properties and to be able to produce more accurate results compared to previous approaches. The paper concludes that this new spinfoam vertex has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of quantum gravity and its role in the fundamental structure of the universe."
846	"The research paper titled ""Smectic elastomer membranes"" investigates the properties of smectic elastomers, which are materials that exhibit both liquid crystal and rubber-like behavior. The main theme of the paper is to understand the deformation behavior of smectic elastomer membranes under external stimuli such as mechanical stress and temperature changes. The researchers conducted a series of experiments and simulations to analyze the smectic elastomer membranes' response to these stimuli. They found that the smectic elastomer membranes exhibit unique deformation behavior, characterized by the formation of wrinkles and folds, as well as changes in their smectic order. The paper concludes that smectic elastomer membranes have potential applications in various fields, including soft robotics and biomedical devices, due to their tunable mechanical properties and responsiveness to external stimuli."
4009	Single-molecule detection with chemical specificity is a powerful and much desired tool for biology, chemistry, physics, and sensing technologies. Surface-enhanced spectroscopies enable single molecule studies, yet reliable substrates of adequate sensitivity are in short supply. We present a simple, scaleable substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes. Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Raman sensitivity, including blinking and spectral diffusion. Electrodynamic simulations show plasmonic focusing, giving electromagnetic enhancements approaching those needed for single-molecule SERS.
3977	This paper provides a comprehensive review of semiconductor quantum light sources, focusing on their applications in quantum information processing and communication. The review covers various types of quantum light sources, including single-photon emitters, entangled photon sources, and quantum-dot lasers. The authors also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in achieving efficient and scalable quantum light sources. Remarkable findings include the recent advancements in developing on-demand single-photon sources and the use of entangled photon sources in quantum key distribution. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future outlook of semiconductor quantum light sources and their impact on quantum technologies.
3922	We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid. The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading failures.
494	This research paper aims to investigate the growth of networks using the preferential attachment mechanism, focusing on nodes with high indegree and low outdegree. The study explores the impact of preferential attachment on the evolution of networks and how it affects the distribution of node degrees. Through simulations and analysis, the research finds that preferential attachment can lead to the formation of scale-free networks with high indegree and low outdegree nodes. The study also highlights the importance of considering preferential attachment when designing and analyzing complex networks. Overall, the research sheds light on the behavior of network growth and provides insights into the role of preferential attachment in shaping network structure.
222	We present the structure of the fully relaxed (001) surface of the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, calculated using density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Two relevant ferroelastic order parameters are identified and characterized: The tilting of the oxygen octahedra, which is present in the bulk phase, oscillates and decreases towards the surface, and an additional ferrodistortive Mn off-centering, triggered by the surface, decays monotonically into the bulk. The narrow d-like energy band that is characteristic of unrelaxed manganite surfaces is shifted down in energy by these structural distortions, retaining its uppermost layer localization. The magnitude of the zero-temperature magnetization is unchanged from its bulk value, but the effective spin-spin interactions are reduced at the surface.
1997	Infrared-Faint Radio Sources represent a new and unexpected class of object which is bright at radio wavelengths but unusually faint at infrared wavelengths. If, like most mJy radio sources, they were either conventional active or star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, we would expect them to be detectable at infrared wavelengths, and so their non-detection by the Spitzer Space Telescope is surprising. Here we report the detection of one of these sources using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, from which we conclude that the sources are driven by Active Galactic Nuclei. We suggest that these sources are either normal radio-loud quasars at high redshift or abnormally obscured radio galaxies.
59	We study Casimir forces on the partition in a closed box (piston) with perfect metallic boundary conditions. Related closed geometries have generated interest as candidates for a repulsive force. By using an optical path expansion we solve exactly the case of a piston with a rectangular cross section, and find that the force always attracts the partition to the nearest base. For arbitrary cross sections, we can use an expansion for the density of states to compute the force in the limit of small height to width ratios. The corrections to the force between parallel plates are found to have interesting dependence on the shape of the cross section. Finally, for temperatures in the range of experimental interest we compute finite temperature corrections to the force (again assuming perfect boundaries).
3055	The paper focuses on analyzing the overhead and packet lengths of random linear coding over the erasure channel. The authors investigate the impact of the number of packets and the size of the field on the overhead and packet length. They also present a new algorithm that reduces the overhead of random linear coding. The results of their analysis show that the overhead and packet length increase with the number of packets and decrease with the size of the field. Moreover, the new algorithm they propose reduces the overhead significantly. The paper provides insights into the design of practical random linear coding systems and shows that random linear coding can achieve high efficiency and reliability over the erasure channel.
3734	This research paper investigates the growth of single-crystal Al2O3 layers on Nb (110) thin films through a layer-by-layer deposition process. The primary theme of the study is to explore the impact of strain on the growth of Al2O3 on Nb (110) thin films and its electronic properties. The essential findings of the study suggest that the strained Al2O3 layers exhibit a unique electronic structure, with the formation of new electronic states near the Fermi level. The study also highlights the potential of strained Al2O3/Nb (110) thin films for the development of novel electronic devices and future applications in the field of materials science.

848	This research paper presents a detailed analysis of P2P IPTV traffic, focusing on the scaling properties of the traffic. The authors use real-world data obtained from a large-scale P2P IPTV system to investigate the behavior of the traffic as the number of users and channels increase. They find that the traffic exhibits self-similarity, which can be used to model the traffic and predict its behavior under different conditions. The results have important implications for the design and management of P2P IPTV systems, as they demonstrate the need for scalable solutions that can handle large numbers of users and channels. The study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of P2P IPTV traffic, which can be used to optimize network performance and enhance the user experience.
96	The research paper explores the concept of topological insulators (TI) beyond the Brillouin zone through the use of Chern parity. The authors demonstrate how Chern parity can be used to determine the topological properties of TIs and show that it is possible to classify TIs using a generalized Brillouin zone. The paper also highlights the importance of studying the topological properties of TIs for the development of new electronic devices. Noteworthy findings include the identification of a new class of TIs and the creation of a map of all possible TIs based on their topological properties. Overall, the paper highlights the significant potential for using Chern parity to explore the properties of TIs and opens up new avenues for research in this field.
2268	It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.
1847	Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking. Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the correlation with more predictive procedures.
2613	This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.
3429	We show theoretically that it is possible to trap and cool the rotational motion of a macroscopic mirror made of a perfectly reflecting spiral phase element using orbital angular momentum transfer from a Laguerre-Gaussian optical field. This technique offers a promising route to the placement of the rotor in its quantum mechanical ground state in the presence of thermal noise. It also opens up the possibility of simultaneously cooling a vibrational mode of the same mirror. Lastly, the proposed design may serve as a sensitive torsional balance in the quantum regime.
D2-45	Educational robotics teaches the design, analysis, application and operation of robots. Robots include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles. Educational robotics can be taught from elementary school to graduate programs. Robotics may also be used to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design. Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics. Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students.
816	This research paper aims to develop a rational method for investigating the dissociation of macromolecules, particularly in the antibody-hapten system. The study involved the design and synthesis of hapten analogs with varying affinities to the antibody and the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the dissociation constants of the antibody-hapten complexes. The results showed that the dissociation of the complexes was dependent on the binding affinity of the hapten to the antibody and the structural properties of the antibody. The developed method can be used to predict the dissociation behavior of macromolecules and aid in the design of more effective therapeutics. Overall, the study provides new insights into the fundamental principles underlying macromolecular dissociation and its implications in drug design and development.
1386	"The research paper titled ""Stability of marginally outer trapped surfaces and existence of marginally outer trapped tubes"" focuses on the study of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) and their stability. The paper investigates the existence of marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTT) and proves that the existence of a MOTT requires the existence of a MOTS. The paper also proves that a MOTS is stable under certain conditions. The research concludes that the stability of MOTS is important in understanding the behavior of black holes and other cosmic phenomena. The paper highlights the significance of MOTS and MOTT in the study of gravitational physics and their potential applications in astrophysics."
833	We perform a non-perturbative sum over geometries in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity model given in terms of Causal Dynamical Triangulations. Inspired by the concept of triangulations of product type introduced previously, we impose an additional notion of order on the discrete, causal geometries. This simplifies the combinatorial problem of counting geometries just enough to enable us to calculate the transfer matrix between boundary states labelled by the area of the spatial universe, as well as the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian of the continuum theory. This is the first time in dimension larger than two that a Hamiltonian has been derived from such a model by mainly analytical means, and opens the way for a better understanding of scaling and renormalization issues.
D2-94	Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, systems, and organisms or to re-engineer existing biological systems for specific purposes. It involves creating synthetic genetic circuits, modifying genomes, or designing artificial enzymes to carry out tasks that natural organisms cannot. The goal of synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to biology, enabling the synthesis of novel compounds, the production of biofuels, the development of new therapeutics, and innovations in environmental sustainability. It has vast potential for applications in medicine, agriculture, energy, and biotechnology, but also raises important ethical and safety considerations.
3356	This research paper investigates the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on quantum coherence in a differential charge qubit. By analyzing the behavior of the qubit under various conditions, we observe that quasiparticle poisoning can significantly degrade the coherence of the system. Our results show that the coherence time of the qubit decreases exponentially with increasing quasiparticle density. Furthermore, we find that the impact of quasiparticle poisoning is more severe in the case of the differential charge qubit compared to the standard charge qubit. This study provides valuable insights into the sources of decoherence in quantum systems and highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of quasiparticle poisoning in the design of quantum devices.
403	In a single-walled carbon nanotube, we observe the spin-1/2 Kondo effect. The energy of spin-resolved Kondo peaks is proportional to magnetic field at high fields, contrary to recent reports. At lower fields, the energy falls below this linear dependence, in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. For even electron occupancy, we observe a spin-1 Kondo effect due to the degeneracy of the triplet ground states. Tuning gate voltage within the same Coulomb diamond drives a transition to a singlet ground state. We also independently tune the energy difference between singlet and triplet states with a magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting thus measured confirms the value of the g-factor measured from the spin-1/2 Kondo feature.
1496	We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, (GTW-WT), and the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, (BATW-WT). It is shown that the two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel (GMAC-WT) to illustrate this advantage.
246	This research paper focuses on the formation of fluctuations in a molecular slab through isobaric thermal instability. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate that thermal fluctuations caused by the instability can lead to density fluctuations in the slab. The results suggest that this process could be responsible for the formation of molecular clouds in the interstellar medium. The paper concludes that isobaric thermal instability is a significant mechanism for the formation of density fluctuations in molecular slabs, and further research is necessary to investigate its implications in astrophysical environments.
102	Abstract: Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a sender to send one out of two messages to a receiver without revealing which message was sent. Key exchange is another essential cryptographic primitive that enables two parties to establish a shared secret key for secure communication. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for oblivious transfer based on key exchange. Our protocol achieves the same security properties as traditional OT protocols while leveraging the efficiency and simplicity of key exchange protocols. We provide a detailed security analysis and implementation of our protocol, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency. Our results suggest that our protocol can be a viable alternative to traditional OT protocols in scenarios where key exchange is already being used.
2398	We consider quantum field theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, with the position coordinates represented by twistors instead of the usual world-vectors. Upon imposing canonical commutation relations between twistors and dual twistors, quantum theory of fields described by non-holomorphic functions of twistor variables becomes manifestly non-commutative, with Lorentz symmetry broken by a time-like vector. We discuss the free field propagation and its impact on the short- and long-distance behavior of physical amplitudes in perturbation theory. In the ultraviolet limit, quantum field theories in twistor space are generically less divergent than their commutative counterparts. Furthermore, there is no infrared--ultraviolet mixing problem.
305	This research paper analyzes the performance of batch processor sharing systems with hyper-exponential service time, using queueing theory and simulation techniques. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the effects of different system parameters on the performance metrics, such as mean response time and throughput. The findings indicate that the system parameters, such as the number of servers and batch sizes, have a significant impact on the system performance. Moreover, the study concludes that the use of batch processing can improve the system performance and reduce the response time, especially for large batch sizes and high utilization levels.
3835	In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives.
3882	This research paper investigates the specific heat and bimodality phenomena in the canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model. The study aims to provide insights into the behavior of the thermodynamic system in different canonical ensembles and to establish a connection between the thermodynamic properties and the system's physical characteristics. The research utilizes numerical simulations to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of a model system. The critical outcomes of the study reveal that the specific heat and bimodality behavior of the system are highly dependent on the ensemble and the system's properties. The research concludes that the canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and can be used to predict the thermodynamic properties of complex systems.
1327	This research paper investigates the Laplace operator in networks of thin fibers, focusing on the spectrum near the threshold. The authors use an approach based on the asymptotic analysis of the operator's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. They provide a detailed analysis of the spectrum, including the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the thickness of the fibers tends to zero. The study shows that the spectrum is highly sensitive to the geometry of the network and the distribution of the fibers. The authors also derive explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions near the threshold. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of networks of thin fibers, such as those used in material science and engineering.
267	The finite temperature phase transition of strongly interacting matter is studied within a nonlocal chiral quark model of the NJL type coupled to a Polyakov loop. In contrast to previous investigations which were restricted to the mean-field approximation, mesonic correlations are included by evaluating the quark-antiquark ring sum. For physical pion masses, we find that the pions dominate the pressure below the phase transition, whereas above T_c the pressure is well described by the mean-field approximation result. For large pion masses, as realized in lattice simulations, the meson effects are suppressed.
435	For every rational homology 3-sphere with 2-torsion only we construct a unified invariant (which takes values in a certain cyclotomic completion of a polynomial ring), such that the evaluation of this invariant at any odd root of unity provides the SO(3) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant at this root and at any even root of unity the SU(2) quantum invariant. Moreover, this unified invariant splits into a sum of the refined unified invariants dominating spin and cohomological refinements of quantum SU(2) invariants. New results on the Ohtsuki series and the integrality of quantum invariants are the main applications of our construction.
3802	This research paper focuses on the reliability of the direction of incident neutrinos in fully contained and partially contained events due to Quasi-Elastic (QEL) interactions in the Super-Kamiokande detector. The study analyzes the data obtained from the detector to determine the accuracy of the direction reconstruction and the impact of QEL interactions on the reliability of the results. The findings show that the direction reconstruction for fully contained events is more reliable than for partially contained events due to the higher energy deposition in the former. However, the study suggests that the accuracy of the direction reconstruction can be improved by applying appropriate correction techniques. These results have important implications for future neutrino experiments and their ability to accurately determine the direction of incident neutrinos.
2739	This research paper proposes a new approach for measuring wave velocities in heterogeneous materials that considers the local properties of the medium. The proposed method involves measuring the wave velocity at multiple locations and then calculating a local average velocity. The results show that this approach provides a more accurate measurement of wave velocities compared to traditional methods that assume a homogeneous medium. This new approach can be useful in various fields such as seismology, geophysics, and materials science. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering local variations in wave velocities for a better understanding of the properties of heterogeneous materials.
807	We study thermodynamical properties of a fuzzy sphere in matrix quantum mechanics of the BFSS type including the Chern-Simons term. Various quantities are calculated to all orders in perturbation theory exploiting the one-loop saturation of the effective action in the large-N limit. The fuzzy sphere becomes unstable at sufficiently strong coupling, and the critical point is obtained explicitly as a function of the temperature. The whole phase diagram is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Above the critical point, we obtain perfect agreement with the all order results. In the region below the critical point, which is not accessible by perturbation theory, we observe the Hagedorn transition. In the high temperature limit our model is equivalent to a totally reduced model, and the relationship to previously known results is clarified.
D1-27	"We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models ""sunspot activity – temperature""."
2597	This research paper presents the Agile Adoption Framework, a disciplined approach to adopting Agile practices. The framework is designed to guide organizations through a structured process that involves assessing their current state, defining their desired future state, and creating a roadmap to achieve that state. The framework is based on extensive research and analysis of successful Agile adoptions, and it provides a comprehensive set of tools and techniques to help organizations succeed in their Agile journey. The paper concludes that the Agile Adoption Framework can be a valuable resource for organizations seeking to adopt Agile practices in a disciplined and effective manner.
3332	The work reported below is a first of its kind study of the properties of turbulent flow without strong mean shear in a Newtonian fluid in proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, with emphasis on the small scale aspects. The main tools used are a three-dimensional particle tracking system (3D-PTV) allowing to measure and follow in a Lagrangian manner the field of velocity derivatives and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The comparison of flow properties in the turbulent (A), intermediate (B) and non-turbulent (C) regions in the proximity of the interface allows for direct observation of the key physical processes underlying the entrainment phenomenon. The differences between small scale strain and enstrophy are striking and point to the definite scenario of turbulent entrainment via the viscous forces originating in strain.
2594	The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson, becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode. The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.
1712	We observe that when a local patch in a radiation filled Robertson-Walker universe inflates by some reason, outside perturbations can enter into the inflating region. Generally, the physical wavelengths of these perturbations become larger than the Hubble radius as they cross into the inflating space and their amplitudes freeze out immediately. It turns out that the corresponding power spectrum is not scale invariant. Although these perturbations cannot reach out to a distance inner observer shielded by a de Sitter horizon, they still indicate a curious boundary effect in local inflationary scenarios.
D2-42	In order to determine how much Vitamin D supplement to take, you first need to find out what your current Vitamin D level is. You determine the level of vitamin D by doing a blood test for 25 (OH) vitamin D. That’s 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Most experts agree that a level of 32 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) in the blood is optimal for bone health but no one agrees on what is optimal for immune health, heart health, cancer health and all the other important functions that vitamin D appears to have. Your skin, where vitamin D is made, has a wonderful system for making the right amount, then shutting off further production.
1898	The electronic structure of the quasi-lowdimensional vanadium sulfide \bavs3 is investigated for the different phases above the magnetic ordering temperature. By means of density functional theory and its combination with dynamical-mean field theory, we follow the evolution of the relevant low-energy electronic states on cooling. Hence we go in the metallic regime from the room temperature hexagonal phase to the orthorhombic phase after the first structural transition, and close with the monoclinic insulating phase below the metal-insulator transition. Due to the low symmetry and expected intersite correlations, the latter phase is treated within cellular dynamical mean-field theory. It is generally discussed how the intriguing interplay between band-structure and strong-correlation effects leads to the stabilization of the various electronic phases with decreasing temperature.
3491	This research paper focuses on the multiobjective optimization of a prismatic drive. The study aims to identify the optimal combination of design parameters that would simultaneously satisfy multiple performance objectives. The proposed methodology is based on the integration of a genetic algorithm and a finite element analysis. The results show that the optimized prismatic drive design can achieve significant improvements in both its static and dynamic performance attributes. The critical outcomes of this study include a better understanding of the complex interaction between design parameters, the development of an efficient optimization methodology for prismatic drives, and the identification of the optimal design for multiobjective optimization. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of prismatic drives in various applications.
464	This research paper aims to investigate the statistical mechanics of complex networks. Specifically, the study explores the relationship between network structure and the behavior of physical systems on the network. The research utilizes graph theory and statistical mechanics to develop models for complex networks and analyze their dynamic properties. The study finds that the behavior of physical systems on complex networks is highly dependent on the network structure, with certain structures leading to more efficient and effective system behavior. The research provides important insights into the design and optimization of complex networks for various applications. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the statistical mechanics of complex networks in order to fully leverage their potential for various applications.
2792	This research paper presents the study of nucleosome remodeling and sliding by the SWI/SNF complex using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The primary focus of the study is to map the dynamic changes in nucleosome structure and positioning during SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. The study highlights the critical role of the SWI/SNF complex in regulating gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape. The key discoveries of this study include the identification of distinct remodeling intermediates and the demonstration of the processivity of SWI/SNF-mediated sliding. The study concludes that AFM imaging provides a valuable tool for investigating the dynamic structural changes induced by chromatin remodeling factors.
3044	Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
1841	We derive the vector-like four dimensional overlap Dirac operator starting from a five dimensional Dirac action in the presence of a delta-function space-time defect. The effective operator is obtained by first integrating out all the fermionic modes in the fixed gauge background, and then identifying the contribution from the localized modes as the determinant of an operator in one dimension less. We define physically relevant degrees of freedom on the defect by introducing an auxiliary defect-bound fermion field and integrating out the original five dimensional bulk field.
1533	The development of somites, the embryonic precursors of the vertebrate body segments, is regulated by a complex network of genetic interactions. This study aims to investigate how the oscillations observed in this network are converted into the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the synchronization of these oscillations is critical for generating the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. We show that the timing and duration of the oscillations are also important factors in determining the final somite pattern. Our results suggest that the genetic network regulating somite formation is highly sensitive to small changes in its parameters, indicating a robust and precise system. These findings provide insight into the mechanistic basis of somite formation and have implications for understanding the development of other complex biological systems.
D2-63	The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance. Ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of insect-based foods is also crucial. Additionally, developing efficient production and processing methods to scale up insect farming is essential for feasibility.
3290	This research paper focuses on the study of dyons with potentials, exploring the duality and black hole thermodynamics of such systems. Through a theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic potentials of dyons, we demonstrate the existence of a duality symmetry that relates electric and magnetic charges. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in the presence of dyons and their potentials, showing that the dyonic contributions to the entropy and temperature of black holes can be significant. Our findings provide new insights into the behavior of dyons and their interactions with black holes, and could have important implications for the understanding of fundamental physics and cosmology.
4014	The study focuses on analyzing the performance of a linear DC SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) mechanical displacement detector using quantum mechanics. The research examines the quantum state of the SQUID and the impact of external factors, such as temperature and magnetic field, on its performance. The study concludes that the detector's sensitivity and accuracy are affected by these external factors, and that quantum mechanics plays a crucial role in understanding and optimizing the performance of the device. The research provides valuable insights into the design and development of quantum-based displacement detectors for various applications.
4016	Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in many quantum technologies. In this research paper, we investigate whether local interactions with not-completely-positive maps can increase entanglement. We introduce a novel technique to study the dynamics of entanglement and apply it to a set of model systems. We find that, under certain conditions, the entanglement between two subsystems can indeed increase due to the local interactions with not-completely-positive maps. This result has important implications for the design of quantum devices and sheds light on the fundamental questions of non-Markovianity and quantum correlations. Our work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the role of not-completely-positive maps in the dynamics of quantum entanglement.
D2-50	The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly destroying Earth as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun.
888	Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations, these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth, five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps.
404	We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom. We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and lifestyle choices, and respite from technology.
3942	Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out
1435	This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for them actively.
1765	This research paper explores the nuclear symmetry energy through heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. The central focus is on understanding the relationship between the symmetry energy and the properties of neutron-rich nuclei. The outcomes of the study suggest that the nuclear symmetry energy is a crucial factor in determining the behavior of neutron-rich nuclei and can be probed effectively through heavy-ion reactions. The conclusion highlights the importance of these findings in advancing our understanding of nuclear physics and in developing models for astrophysical processes involving neutron-rich matter.
1621	The research paper presents a study of the radio lobes of Pictor A using X-ray spatially resolved analysis. The lobes were found to have a complex structure, with different regions exhibiting distinct spectral properties. The X-ray emission was found to be dominated by synchrotron radiation, with evidence of inverse Compton scattering in some regions. The study provides insights into the physical processes responsible for the formation and evolution of radio lobes. The findings have implications for understanding the role of active galactic nuclei in the evolution of galaxies.
3255	The research paper explores the theory of integrable lattices and their sublattices. In particular, it focuses on the B-quadrilateral lattice and its relation to self-adjoint schemes on the triangular and honeycomb lattices. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties and symmetries of these lattices, and derives several important results concerning their integrability and the existence of special types of solutions. The main conclusion of the paper is that the B-quadrilateral lattice and its sublattices are important objects of study in the theory of integrable systems, and can be used to derive new insights into the properties of lattice models in physics and mathematics.
2502	We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015+161 each has an infrared excess that can be understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid with a chondritic composition.
763	We elaborate an unified geometric approach to classical mechanics, Riemann-Finsler spaces and gravity theories on Lie algebroids provided with nonlinear connection (N-connection) structure. There are investigated the conditions when the fundamental geometric objects like the anchor, metric and linear connection, almost sympletic and related almost complex structures may be canonically defined by a N-connection induced from a regular Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian), in mechanical models, or by generic off-diagonal metric terms and nonholonomic frames, in gravity theories. Such geometric constructions are modelled on nonholonomic manifolds provided with nonintegrable distributions and related chains of exact sequences of submanifolds defining N-connections. We investigate the main properties of the Lagrange, Hamilton, Finsler-Riemann and Einstein-Cartan algebroids and construct and analyze exact solutions describing such objects.
1351	A discrete Laplace transform and its inversion formula are obtained by using a quadrature of the continuous Fourier transform which is given in terms of Hermite polynomials and its zeros. This approach yields a convergent discrete formula for the two-sided Laplace transform if the function to be transformed falls off rapidly to zero and satisfy certain conditions of integrability, achieving convergence also for singular functions. The inversion formula becomes a quadrature formula for the Bromwich integral. This procedure also yields a quadrature formula for the Mellin transform and its corresponding inversion formula that can be generalized straightforwardly for functions of several variables.

The findings of this study have important implications for the development of new diagnostic tools for blood disorders and for the understanding of the underlying physics of light scattering in biological systems.
2137	Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades. Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially. Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.
1054	This research paper explores the potential existence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and their implications for particle physics. The Lee-Wick model predicts the existence of a tower of excited states for each gauge boson, which could explain some of the observed anomalies in current experimental data. We present a detailed analysis of the LHC data, focusing on the search for resonant peaks in the invariant mass distribution of the final state particles. We find no evidence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons in the current data, placing stringent limits on the model parameters. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of new physics models beyond the Standard Model.
3355	We demonstrate the operation of a differential single Cooper-pair box, a charge qubit consisting of two aluminum islands, isolated from ground, coupled by a pair of small-area Josephson junctions, and read out with a superconducting differential radio-frequency single electron transistor. We have tested four devices, all of which show evidence of quasiparticle poisoning. The devices are characterized with microwave spectroscopy and temperature dependence studies, and Coulomb staircases are shown to be e-periodic in all samples. However, coherent control is still possible with non-adiabatic voltage pulses. Coherent oscillation experiments and a relaxation time measurement were performed using a charge derivative readout technique.

Overall, this research paper highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental properties of materials under different conditions and provides a basis for further research in this area.
2335	By means of low-temperature expansions (LTEs), the nucleation free energy and the precipitate interface free energy are expressed as functions of the solubility limit for alloys which lead to the precipitation of a stoichiometric L12 compound such as Al-Sc or Al-Zr alloys. Classical nucleation theory is then used to obtain a simple expression of the nucleation rate whose validity is demonstrated by a comparison with atomic simulations. LTEs also explain why simple mean-field approximation like the Bragg-Williams approximation fails to predict correct nucleation rates in such an ordering alloy.
2305	Critical behavior of the Ising model is investigated at the center of large scale finite size systems, where the lattice is represented as the tiling of pentagons. The system is on the hyperbolic plane, and the recursive structure of the lattice makes it possible to apply the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. From the calculated nearest neighbor spin correlation function and the spontaneous magnetization, it is concluded that the phase transition of this model is mean-field like. One parameter deformation of the corner Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic plane is discussed.

The results demonstrate that long-range electrostatic forces can indeed drive the spontaneous formation of chiral structures, and that the strength of the electrostatic interactions plays a critical role in determining the degree of chirality observed. The findings have important implications for understanding the emergence of chirality in biological systems and the design of new materials with chiral properties.

2416	Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient approximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the migration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for coarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain boundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an intrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline metals.

The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional combining with function space parametrization technique or function space embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem. Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the proposed algorithm is feasible.
313	In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.

Additionally, the authors found a correlation between the star formation rate and the metallicity of the galaxies, suggesting that star formation can affect the chemical composition of these galaxies. Overall, this study provides important insights into the chemical properties of star-forming dwarf galaxies and highlights the need for further research in this area.

3486	We have recently pointed out that color magnetic field is generated in dense quark matter, i.e. color ferromagnetic phase of quark matter. Using light cone quantization, we show that gluons occupying the lowest Landau level under the color magnetic field effectively form a two dimensional quantum well (layer), in which infinitely many zero modes of the gluons are present. We discuss that the zero modes of the gluons form a quantum Hall state by interacting repulsively with each other, just as electrons do in semiconductors. Such a ferromagnetic quark matter with the layer structure of the gluons is a possible origin of extremely strong magnetic field observed in magnetars.
2783	The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction [ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy. Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate for the high-density electron gas.

The results show a significant difference in the anisotropy of the two layers, with the Co layer exhibiting a much larger anisotropy than the FeMn layer. This finding suggests that Co/FeMn bilayers have strong potential for use in spintronic devices that require high magnetic anisotropy. The research paper concludes that the study provides valuable insights into the magnetic properties of Co/FeMn bilayers and their potential applications in technology.
1265	We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.

Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the structure of the QCD vacuum and its role in understanding the properties of hadrons.
2564	There is a huge amount of historical documents in libraries and in various National Archives that have not been exploited electronically. Although automatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term objective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication and extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to aging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open research field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing methods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of historical interest.

Overall, the paper provides insights into the potential benefits of algorithm synthesis and highlights its relevance in modern computing systems.
325	Parallel transport of a connection in a smooth fibre bundle yields a functor from the path groupoid of the base manifold into a category that describes the fibres of the bundle. We characterize functors obtained like this by two notions we introduce: local trivializations and smooth descent data. This provides a way to substitute categories of functors for categories of smooth fibre bundles with connection. We indicate that this concept can be generalized to connections in categorified bundles, and how this generalization improves the understanding of higher dimensional parallel transport.
543	When looking for a solution, deterministic methods have the enormous advantage that they do find global optima. Unfortunately, they are very CPU-intensive, and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore. In order to get a result, one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms, that sample the search space without exploring it thoroughly. Such algorithms can find very good results, without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached; but there is often no other choice than using them. This chapter is a short introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization.
1162	We study spin-polarized transient transport in a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads subjected to a rectangular bias voltage pulse. Time-dependent spin-resolved currents, occupations, spin accumulation, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated using both nonequilibrium Green function and master equation techniques. Both parallel and antiparallel leads' magnetization alignments are analyzed. Our main findings are: a dynamical spin accumulation that changes sign in time, a short-lived pulse of spin polarized current in the emitter lead (but not in the collector lead), and a dynamical TMR that develops negative values in the transient regime. We also observe that the intra-dot Coulomb interaction can enhance even further the negative values of the TMR.
D2-44	To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics
3140	This research paper focuses on the development of conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. Invariant functionals are mathematical expressions that remain unchanged under certain transformations. Compositions, on the other hand, refer to the act of combining two or more functions to create a new one. In this study, we apply the Noether's theorem to derive the conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by considering several examples, including systems governed by differential equations. The results of this study have important implications for the fields of physics, mathematics, and engineering, as conservation laws are fundamental to understanding the behavior of physical systems. Our findings can be used to develop more accurate models and simulations of complex systems, ultimately leading to improved design and control strategies.

1565	The blow-up in finite time for the solutions to the initial-boundary value problem associated to the multi-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a bounded domain is proved. The model consists on conservation of mass equation and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible Euler equations corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance. The proof is based on a-priori estimates for the energy functional for a new observable constructed with an auxiliary function, and it is shown that, under suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data, the solution blows up after a finite time.

Specifically, we show that the Gutzwiller approximation can be used to accurately describe the metal-insulator transition in the dimer lattice model and to predict the behavior of the system in the presence of external perturbations. Our results highlight the potential of the Gutzwiller approach for studying Mott insulators in a variety of materials and contexts.

We then explore the practical implications of this property for traders, outlining specific trading strategies that can be implemented to take advantage of this behavior. Our findings have important implications for both academics and practitioners in the field of financial derivatives, providing new insights into the behavior of Swing options and highlighting opportunities for profitable trading strategies.
974	"We investigate the behaviour of an original traffic model. The model considers a single multi-lane street, populated by autonomous vehicles directed from either end to the other. Lanes have no intrinsic directionality, and the vehicles are inserted at random at either end and any lane. Collision avoidance is fully automatic and, to enhance the transport capacity of the street, vehicles form_trains_ in which they may travel at high speed quite close to the vehicle in front. We report on the transit times for vehicles under a wide variety of conditions: vehicle insertion probability & imbalance and their maximum speed distribution. We also outline an interesting feature of the model, that the complex interactions of many vehicles are considerably more powerful than a simple ""keep left"" directive which each vehicle should obey."
D1-15	General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics.
3358	This research paper focuses on the high-mass star formation process and the dynamical evolution of Orion Source I on 10-100 AU scales using SiO masers.

The results of the study reveal that the SiO masers trace the outflowing gas and the rotation of the circumstellar disk around the protostar. The findings provide critical insights into the early stages of high-mass star formation and the role of SiO masers in probing the dynamical evolution of protostellar systems.

1176	We construct analytic solutions for marginal deformations satisfying the reality condition in open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits when operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated superconformal primary field are regular. Our strategy is based on the recent observation by Erler that the problem of finding solutions for marginal deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality condition by construction.

Overall, this research enhances our understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of model checking HOFL and provides a valuable contribution to the field of formal methods for software engineering.
3660	We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.
2152	Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.
394	Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex.

Empirical results obtained using real data are given and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99%.
3060	The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and repulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.

The primary objective of this study is to understand how thermal effects impact the performance of solid state lasers and to identify potential solutions to mitigate these effects. Through a series of experiments and simulations, the study reveals that thermal effects can significantly impair the performance of ytterbium-doped solid state lasers, leading to reduced efficiency and output power. To address this issue, the study proposes using advanced cooling techniques and optimizing the laser cavity design. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the thermal effects in solid state lasers and suggest practical solutions to improve their performance.
968	Dynamics of Wilson loops in pure Yang-Mills theories is analyzed in terms of random walks of the holonomies of the gauge field on the gauge group manifold. It is shown that such random walks should necessarily be free. The distribution of steps of these random walks is related to the spectrum of string tensions of the theory and to certain cumulants of Yang-Mills curvature tensor. It turns out that when colour charges are completely screened, the holonomies of the gauge field can change only by the elements of the group center, which indicates that in the screening regime confinement persists due to thin center vortices. Thick center vortices are also considered and the emergence of such stepwise changes in the limits of infinitely thin vortices and infinitely large loops is demonstrated.
2920	The research paper presents a multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA. The study focuses on the electronic properties of DNA when it is subjected to mechanical stress, such as stretching. The findings suggest that stretching causes a significant increase in the localization of electronic states, leading to a decrease in conductivity. The study also reveals that the degree of localization is highly dependent on the stretch direction and magnitude, as well as the DNA sequence and structure. The multiscale model provides a comprehensive understanding of electronic properties of DNA under mechanical stress and can contribute to the design of new DNA-based electronic devices.

Overall, the relativistic flux tube model provides a framework for understanding the properties of hadrons and their interactions.

1989	"We perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the TIP5P model to quantify structural order in both the first shell (defined by four nearest neighbors)and second shell (defined by twelve next-nearest neighbors) of a central water molecule. We find the anomalous decrease of orientational order upon compression occurs in both shells, but the anomalous decrease of translational order upon compression occurs {\it mainly in the second shell}. The decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression (""structural anomaly"") are thus correlated only in the second shell. Our findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second shell upon compression."
2527	Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain (PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms. Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.
2801	Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple (constant source function) and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet chromosphere, such as mottles/spicules, as well as for active region structures such as fibrils, arch filament systems (AFS), filaments and flares.
3083	The structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4 is a topic of great interest due to its potential applications in fields such as catalysis and materials science. In this research paper, we investigate the effects of Cr3+ substitution on the local atomic structure of MgAl2O4 using computational methods. Our results demonstrate that the presence of Cr3+ induces significant structural relaxation, leading to changes in bond lengths and angles in the immediate vicinity of the dopant. We also examine the impact of various factors such as temperature and dopant concentration on the relaxation behavior. These findings provide a basis for further exploration of the properties and applications of Cr3+-doped MgAl2O4 materials.
3917	This research paper investigates the impact of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four-dimensional Universe. The study employs theoretical models and computational simulations to explore the behavior of energy conservation in different scenarios where a fifth dimension is present, absent, or varying in size. The results indicate that the existence of a fifth dimension may significantly affect the conservation of energy, depending on its properties and interactions with the four-dimensional space-time. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and their implications for the structure and dynamics of the Universe.
2033	Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.
618	The polarization splitting of the exciton ground state in two laterally coupled quantum dots under an in-plane electric field is investigated and its effective tuning is designed. It is found that there are significant Stark effect and anticrossing in energy levels. Due to coupling between inter- and intra-dot states, the absolute value of polarization splitting is significantly reduced, and it could be tuned to zero by the electric field for proper inter-dot separations. Our scheme is interesting for the research on the quantum dots-based entangled-photon source.
D2-67	The Lavoisier Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, was formulated by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. This law states that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products during a chemical reaction. In simpler terms, matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it only transforms from one form to another. This fundamental principle revolutionized chemistry, as it emphasized the importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding the fate of matter in reactions. The law laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory and remains a cornerstone of scientific understanding.

527	Recent progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model the non-perturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. Based on these results, we propose a phenomenological family of waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of black hole coalescence. We also construct a template bank using this family of waveforms and discuss its implementation in the search for signatures of gravitational waves produced by black-hole coalescences in the data of ground-based interferometers. This template bank might enable us to extend the present inspiral searches to higher-mass binary black-hole systems, i.e., systems with total mass greater than about 80 solar masses, thereby increasing the reach of the current generation of ground-based detectors.

The paper examines the similarities between astrophysical accretion disks and the dynamics of fluids in curved spacetime, and shows how the study of these analogies can help us understand the behavior of accretion disks and other gravity systems. The authors conclude that the study of astrophysical accretion as an analogue gravity phenomenon has the potential to provide new insights into the fundamental nature of gravity and its role in the universe."
2172	We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects.
1768	A finite element method is presented to compute time harmonic microwave fields in three dimensional configurations. Nodal-based finite elements have been coupled with an absorbing boundary condition to solve open boundary problems. This paper describes how the modeling of large devices has been made possible using parallel computation, New algorithms are then proposed to implement this formulation on a cluster of workstations (10 DEC ALPHA 300X) and on a CRAY C98. Analysis of the computation efficiency is performed using simple problems. The electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave by a perfect electric conducting airplane is finally given as example.
2964	The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure.
2477	I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.
2840	This research paper focuses on the study of quantum superpositions and entanglement of thermal states at high temperatures and their applications to quantum information processing.

The repository contains light curves of 582 GRBs observed by the Swift/XRT telescope from 2004 to 2019. The remarkable finding is that the repository allows for the analysis of the temporal behavior of GRBs in a systematic and efficient manner, leading to better understanding of the physics behind these high-energy phenomena. The conclusion is that the repository will be a valuable resource for future studies of GRBs.
650	This research paper discusses the discovery of an abundance of invariant polynomials that satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical problem that has been a topic of research for over a century and is closely related to the distribution of prime numbers. The researchers found that these new polynomials not only satisfy the Riemann hypothesis but also have additional properties that make them useful in a variety of mathematical applications. The paper presents the methodology used to identify these polynomials and provides evidence for their validity. The results of this study are significant as they provide new insights into the Riemann hypothesis and offer potential new avenues for future mathematical research.
1959	We study the consequences of CPT and lepton number violation in neutrino sector. For CPT violation we take gravity with which neutrino and antineutrino couple differently. Gravity mixes neutrino and antineutrino in an unequal ratio to give two mass eigenstates. Lepton number violation interaction together with CPT violation gives rise to neutrino-antineutrino oscillation. Subsequently, we study the neutrino flavor mixing and oscillation under the influence of gravity. It is found that gravity changes flavor oscillation significantly which influences the relative abundance of different flavors in present universe. We show that the neutrinoless double beta decay rate is modified due to presence of gravity- the origin of CPT violation, as the mass of the flavor state is modified.
3721	Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L. This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
3415	We study elementary low energy excitations inside a supersolid. We find that the coupling between the longitudinal lattice vibration mode and the superfluid mode leads to two longitudinal modes (one upper branch and one lower branch) inside the supersolid, while the transverse modes in the supersolid stay the same as those inside a normal solid. We also work out various experimental signatures of these novel elementary excitations by evaluating the Debye-Waller factor, density-density correlation, vortex loop-vertex loop interactions, specific heat and excess entropy from the vacancies per mole.
3500	We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed.
670	This research paper presents the results of an experiment conducted at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to study the production of cascade hypernuclei. The central focus of the study is to understand the properties of these exotic nuclei, which contain strange quarks. The paper reports the observation of a new hypernuclear state in the production spectra and provides insight into the production mechanism of cascade hypernuclei. The key findings suggest that the production of cascade hypernuclei is sensitive to the incident energy and the target nucleus. These results have important implications for our understanding of nuclear physics and the properties of the strong force.
1948	We study the flow response to an externally imposed homogeneous magnetic field in a turbulent swirling flow of liquid sodium -- the VKS2 experiment in which magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm up to 50 are reached. Induction effects are larger than in the former VKS1 experiment. At Rm larger than about 25, the local amplitude of induced field components supersedes that of the applied field, and exhibits non-Gaussian fluctuations. Slow dynamical instationarities and low-frequency bimodal dynamics are observed in the induction, presumably tracing back to large scale fluctuations in the hydrodynamic flow.
429	Intelligent Input Methods (IM) are essential for making text entries in many East Asian scripts, but their application to other languages has not been fully explored. This paper discusses how such tools can contribute to the development of computer processing of other oriental languages. We propose a design philosophy that regards IM as a text service platform, and treats the study of IM as a cross disciplinary subject from the perspectives of software engineering, human-computer interaction (HCI), and natural language processing (NLP). We discuss these three perspectives and indicate a number of possible future research directions.
1743	This research paper investigates the optical pumping of charged excitons in unintentionally doped InAs quantum dots.

The study also explores the potential applications of this phenomenon in the development of quantum dot-based optoelectronic devices. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of charged excitons in InAs quantum dots and offer new avenues for the design and optimization of quantum dot-based devices.
814	This research paper presents a method for deriving the temperature, mass, and age of evolved stars from high-resolution spectra.

The authors find that the temperature and mass of the stars in IC 4651 are consistent with previous studies, and they are able to estimate the age of the cluster to be around 1.8 billion years. The method presented in this paper is useful for studying the properties of evolved stars and can be applied to other stellar populations.
3514	We obtain a system of exact solutions of the Dirac equation for an electron moving in a constant homogeneous external magnetic field with account of its vacuum magnetic moment and assumed Lorentz invariance violation in the minimal CPT-odd form in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Using these solutions, characteristics of the particle synchrotron radiation are calculated, and possible observable effects caused by the Lorentz non-invariant interaction are described. We demonstrate that the angular distribution of the radiation has specific asymmetry, which can be explained as a consequence of non-conservation of transversal electron polarization in the presence of a background Lorentz non-invariant condensate field.
2175	This research paper explores the influence of opinion leaders on opinion formation in social networks. The main objectives were to study different models of opinion formation and to investigate how the presence of opinion leaders affects the diffusion of opinions. The study found that opinion leaders can significantly impact the spread of opinions in a social network, especially when they have a large following or are perceived as trustworthy. Additionally, the research identified that the type of opinion leader and the timing of their intervention can also affect the diffusion of opinions. These findings have important implications for understanding how opinions are formed and spread in social networks, and suggest that targeted interventions by opinion leaders may be effective in shaping public opinion.
874	"A detailed analysis of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in spacelike Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory is presented. A semiclassical treatment reproduces the leading terms of the tree-level result from quantum field theory. Moreover, certain quantum corrections turn out to be suppressed for large energies of the charged particle, for example, the quantum corrections to the classical MCS Cherenkov angle. It is argued that MCS-theory Cherenkov radiation may, in principle, lead to anisotropy effects for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In addition, a qualitative discussion of vacuum Cherenkov radiation from a modified-Maxwell term in the action is given, together with UHECR bounds on some of its dimensionless ""coupling constants."""
3885	We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.
1707	This paper explores the connection between cosmological symmetry breaking, pseudo-scale invariance, dark energy, and the standard model. It proposes a modified theory in which the Higgs field plays a key role in driving the acceleration of the universe, providing a possible explanation for dark energy. The study also suggests that the universe may exhibit a pseudo-scale invariance, which could explain the observed cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between fundamental physics and cosmology in resolving some of the most challenging problems in modern science.
2111	This research paper focuses on the implementation of a Gauss convoluted Pandel probability density function (PDF) for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes. The PDF is used to estimate the track direction and energy of neutrino-induced muons. The proposed method is compared with other reconstruction methods and is found to have better performance in terms of accuracy and resolution. The study also shows that the method is robust and can handle high levels of background noise. The outcomes of the study suggest that the Gauss convoluted Pandel PDF can be a useful tool for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes, leading to improved neutrino detection and identification.
2446	New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies. Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.
3456	This research paper investigates the process of electromagnetic field quantization in magnetodielectric media with the presence of external charges.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical analysis of weighted networks and emphasizes the importance of considering edge weights in network analysis."
3069	We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.
1750	The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth was studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature stage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy concentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal and vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged defects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations necessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot cooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine concentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the high-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities were obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the postgrowth annealing of the ingot.
1778	This paper deals with the computation of the rank and of some integer Smith forms of a series of sparse matrices arising in algebraic K-theory. The number of non zero entries in the considered matrices ranges from 8 to 37 millions. The largest rank computation took more than 35 days on 50 processors. We report on the actual algorithms we used to build the matrices, their link to the motivic cohomology and the linear algebra and parallelizations required to perform such huge computations. In particular, these results are part of the first computation of the cohomology of the linear group GL_7(Z).
3236	"The research paper titled ""The Solar-Interior Equation of State with the Path-Integral Formalism I.

The authors use the path-integral formalism to calculate the equation of state, which gives a more accurate description of the behavior of matter at high temperatures and densities. The study focuses on the domain of validity of the equation of state and found that the path-integral approach leads to a better agreement with observational data than previous models. The authors conclude that their new approach provides a more accurate description of the solar interior and can be applied to other astrophysical systems."

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of differential sequences and their applications, highlighting their importance in modern cryptography and coding theory.
2419	This research paper investigates the near-infrared spectra of red supergiants and giants using models with solar and mixing-induced surface abundance ratios. The study finds that the models with mixing-induced surface abundance ratios better match the observed spectra, indicating the importance of mixing processes in the evolution of these stars. The results also suggest that the near-infrared spectra can provide valuable insights into the chemical composition and evolution of red supergiants and giants. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the physical properties and evolution of these important stars.
3645	A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
3040	This research paper explores the significance of wide field surveys in expanding our understanding of the astronomical discovery space. With the advent of new technologies, astronomers now have the ability to conduct large, systematic surveys of the sky, enabling them to uncover new and exciting discoveries. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of wide field surveys and their potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe.

3184	We introduce a procedure developed by the ``Teramo Stellar Populations Tools'' group (Teramo-SPoT), specifically optimized to obtain realistic simulations of CCD images of elliptical galaxies. Particular attention is devoted to include the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) signal observed in ellipticals and to simulate the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy, and the distribution of background galaxies present in real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated objects - galaxy distance and brightness profile, luminosity function of GC and background galaxies, etc. - the tool presented allows the user to set some of the main instrumental properties - FoV, zero point magnitude, exposure time, etc.
1401	Feature tracking and recognition are increasingly common tools for data analysis, but are typically implemented on an ad-hoc basis by individual research groups, limiting the usefulness of derived results when selection effects and algorithmic differences are not controlled. Specific results that are affected include the solar magnetic turnover time, the distributions of sizes, strengths, and lifetimes of magnetic features, and the physics of both small scale flux emergence and the small-scale dynamo. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed comparison between four tracking codes applied to a single set of data from SOHO/MDI, describe the interplay between desired tracking behavior and parameterization of tracking algorithms, and make recommendations for feature selection and tracking practice in future work.
2990	We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models, which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples underline the results.
2861	We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its critical temperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be achieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation time is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from above. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the dependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not have to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the induced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.
3637	We study a recently introduced model of one-component glass-forming liquids whose constituents interact with anisotropic potential. This system is interesting per-se and as a model of liquids like glycerol (interacting via hydrogen bonds) which are excellent glass formers. We work out the statistical mechanics of this system, encoding the liquid and glass disorder using appropriate quasi-particles (36 of them). The theory provides a full explanation of the glass transition phenomenology, including the identification of a diverging length scale and a relation between the structural changes and the diverging relaxation times.
1636	We observe large-amplitude Rabi oscillations between an atomic and a molecular state near a Feshbach resonance. The experiment uses 87Rb in an optical lattice and a Feshbach resonance near 414 G. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations depend on magnetic field in a way that is well described by a two-level model. The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.
3248	"The research paper titled ""Rate Bounds for MIMO Relay Channels"" investigates the maximum achievable rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel. The authors derive lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the MIMO relay channel with multiple antennas at the source, relay, and destination. They also propose a new achievable rate region for the MIMO relay channel, which outperforms previous results. The research concludes that the use of relay channels can significantly improve the communication rate and performance in MIMO systems. The proposed bounds and achievable rate region provide valuable insights into the fundamental limits and potential of MIMO relay channels."
3850	Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed.
2698	The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial dislocations.
316	We discuss a mechanism which generates a mass term for a scalar field in an expanding universe. The mass of this field turns out to be generated by the cosmological constant and can be naturally small if protected by a conformal symmetry which is however broken in the gravitational sector. The mass is comparable today to the Hubble time. This scalar field could thus impact our universe today and for example be at the origin of a time variation of the couplings and masses of the parameters of the standard model.
1922	Masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, which are ground states of light or/and heavy quarks and antiquarks, have been calculated in the framework of an extended model of quasi-independent quarks with absolute uncertainties about 30 MeV. It is shown that the assumption on equidistant discrete levels for a mean field energy does not contradict to existing data and permits to reduce a number of model parameters. It is obtained, that a difference between neighbouring mean field energy levels is flavour independent. Values of spin-spin interaction between quarks and antiquarks with different flavours in pseudoscalar and vector mesons are presented.
324	The paper presents a generic discrete-event random simulation model, VOODB, for evaluating the performance of object-oriented databases (OODBs). The model is designed to provide a realistic representation of OODB behavior and to enable the evaluation of different OODB configurations and workload scenarios. The paper discusses the design and implementation of the VOODB model, including the modeling of OODB components and the generation of realistic workload scenarios. The paper also presents a set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the VOODB model in evaluating OODB performance. The results show that the VOODB model can accurately capture the behavior of different OODB configurations and workload scenarios and can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize OODB performance. Overall, the paper provides a valuable tool for OODB performance evaluation and optimization.
1695	"The research paper titled ""Effect of a Zeeman field on the superconductor-ferromagnet transition in metallic grains"" explores the impact of a magnetic field on the transition between a superconducting and ferromagnetic state in metallic grains. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of these materials under different conditions and demonstrates that the presence of a Zeeman field can significantly affect the superconductor-ferromagnet transition. The paper concludes that the Zeeman field plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of these materials, and further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering magnetic fields when studying the properties of metallic grains."
2854	This research paper investigates the mid-infrared fine structure line ratios in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using data obtained from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Specifically, the study explores the possibility of extinction by the torus, a dusty structure that surrounds the central black hole of AGN. The results suggest that the fine structure line ratios are consistent with extinction by the torus, supporting the idea that the torus plays a significant role in shaping the observed properties of AGN. This research sheds light on the complex interplay between the central engine and the surrounding environment in AGN, providing valuable insights into the physics of these powerful objects.
3159	This research paper focuses on the application of recurrence analysis to the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect, a phenomenon of plastic deformation in metals. The study examines the recurrence patterns of the PLC effect in aluminum and investigates the potential of recurrence analysis as a tool for predicting material failure. The results indicate that recurrence analysis can effectively capture the dynamics of the PLC effect and could be a useful tool for predicting material failure in engineering applications. The study highlights the potential of recurrence analysis for understanding the complex behavior of materials under stress.
1723	This research paper investigates the sensitivity of low degree oscillations to changes in solar abundances. The study uses data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to analyze variations in the frequencies of solar oscillations caused by changes in the abundances of different chemical elements. The results reveal that low degree oscillations are highly sensitive to changes in solar abundances, especially for elements such as helium and oxygen. The study also suggests that these oscillations could be used to infer changes in the composition of the solar interior. Overall, the findings of this research paper have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Sun, and could contribute to the development of more accurate models of solar behavior.
291	"Edge casing is a well-known method to improve the readability of drawings of non-planar graphs. A cased drawing orders the edges of each edge crossing and interrupts the lower edge in an appropriate neighborhood of the crossing. Certain orders will lead to a more readable drawing than others. We formulate several optimization criteria that try to capture the concept of a ""good"" cased drawing. Further, we address the algorithmic question of how to turn a given drawing into an optimal cased drawing. For many of the resulting optimization problems, we either find polynomial time algorithms or NP-hardness results."
3656	This research paper focuses on the study of the spectroscopic properties of polarons in strongly correlated systems using the Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method. The primary theme of the research is to understand the electronic structure and dynamics of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions. The study finds that the polaronic effects are enhanced in strongly correlated systems, leading to a significant change in the spectral properties of the material. The Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method is shown to be a powerful tool for investigating the polaronic effects in strongly correlated systems. The research provides important insights into the behavior of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions, which can be useful for designing new materials with desired electronic properties.
D1-6	The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth’s lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These movements shape the planet, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. The theory builds on continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, and is supported by evidence from seafloor spreading, fossil distribution, and geological formations. Plates move apart at divergent boundaries, collide at convergent boundaries, and slide past each other at transform boundaries. Their movement is driven by mantle convection, gravity, and Earth’s rotation, constantly reshaping the surface. This theory is essential for understanding natural disasters and the geological evolution of continents.
3430	This research paper investigates the use of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam to trap and cool the rotational motion of a mirror. The experiment aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in reducing the rotational motion of the mirror, which is essential in gravitational wave detectors. The study utilizes a combination of classical mechanics and quantum optics to analyze the properties of the Laguerre-Gaussian beam and its interaction with the mirror. The results show that the beam successfully reduces the mirror's rotational motion and confirms the potential of this technique in improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. Overall, this study establishes a promising avenue for further research in the field of gravitational wave detection.
2997	The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed states is studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrence two pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the same entanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtained inequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even in infinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in terms of those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can find useful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a given pure state.
139	We investigate the dissipative real-time evolution of the order parameter for the deconfining transition in the pure SU(2) gauge theory. The approach to equilibrium after a quench to temperatures well above the critical one is described by a Langevin equation. To fix completely the markovian Langevin dynamics we choose the dissipation coefficient, that is a function of the temperature, guided by preliminary Monte Carlo simulations for various temperatures. Assuming a relationship between Monte Carlo time and real time, we estimate the delay in thermalization brought about by dissipation and noise.
1775	The research paper investigates the phenomenon of revival-collapse in the quadrature squeezing of the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model with binomial states. The authors explore the time evolution of the quadrature squeezing parameter and find that the revivals and collapses occur periodically, with the period depending on the number of photons and the coupling strength. They also analyze the effects of different initial conditions on the revival-collapse phenomenon. The study provides insights into the behavior of quantum systems and may have potential applications in quantum information processing and communication.
2958	We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail, with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes. However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent interference minima.
2221	The Lee-Wick Standard Model is a theoretical framework that modifies the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing an additional set of heavy particles with negative norm. This paper presents an overview of the Lee-Wick Standard Model, including its motivation, theoretical foundations, and experimental implications. The key outcomes of the research include the explanation of the Hierarchy Problem, the prediction of new physics phenomena at the TeV scale, and the potential for experimental verification through high energy collider experiments. The Lee-Wick Standard Model represents a promising avenue for future theoretical and experimental investigations into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe.
689	We present here a detailed study of the behaviour of a three dimensional Brownian motor based on cold atoms in a double optical lattice [P. Sjolund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 190602 (2006)]. This includes both experiments and numerical simulations of a Brownian particle. The potentials used are spatially and temporally symmetric, but combined spatiotemporal symmetry is broken by phase shifts and asymmetric transfer rates between potentials. The diffusion of atoms in the optical lattices is rectified and controlled both in direction and speed along three dimensions. We explore a large range of experimental parameters, where irradiances and detunings of the optical lattice lights are varied within the dissipative regime. Induced drift velocities in the order of one atomic recoil velocity have been achieved.
3749	The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
1642	We report a computational first-principles study of positron trapping at vacancy defects in metals and semiconductors. The main emphasis is on the energetics of the trapping process including the interplay between the positron state and the defect's ionic structure and on the ensuing annihilation characteristics of the trapped state. For vacancies in covalent semiconductors the ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling the localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not strongly affect the characteristic features of the electronic structure, e.g., the ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal vacancies the positron-induced ion relaxation has a noticeable effect on the calculated positron lifetime and momentum distribution of annihilating electron-positron pairs.
3227	The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars, essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular, we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are due to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca process). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.
2108	A modification of the optimal fluctuation approach is applied to study the tails of the free energy distribution function P(F) for an elastic string in quenched disorder both in the regions of the universal behavior of P(F) and in the regions of large fluctuations, where the behavior of P(F) is non-universal. The difference between the two regimes is shown to consist in whether it is necessary or not to take into account the renormalization of parameters by the fluctuations of disorder in the vicinity of the optimal fluctuation.
2887	This research paper presents a novel approach to modeling the field of laser welding melt pool using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN). The study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of RBFNN in predicting the shape and size of the melt pool during the laser welding process. The results show that the proposed RBFNN model can accurately predict the melt pool geometry and temperature distribution, indicating its potential for optimizing the laser welding process. The study contributes to the advancement of laser welding technology and provides a foundation for further research in this field.
1490	We analyze five epochs of Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations of the nearby spiral galaxy M33. Each epoch covered nearly a square degree at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 microns. The point source catalog from the full dataset contains 37,650 stars. The stars have luminosities characteristic of the asymptotic giant branch and can be separated into oxygen-rich and carbon-rich populations by their [3.6] - [4.5] colors. The [3.6] - [8.0] colors indicate that over 80% of the stars detected at 8.0 microns have dust shells. Photometric comparison of epochs using conservative criteria yields a catalog of 2,923 variable stars. These variables are most likely long-period variables amidst an evolved stellar population. At least one-third of the identified carbon stars are variable.
2738	The classical characterization of \wp, as a typical concept for far field phenomena, has been successfully applied to many \w phenomena in past decades. The recent reports of superluminal tunnelling times and negative group velocities challenged this concept. A new local approach for the definition of \wvs avoiding these difficulties while including the classical definitions as particular cases is proposed here. This generalisation of the conventional non-local approach can be applied to arbitrary \w forms and propagation media. Some applications of the formalism are presented and basic properties of the concept are summarized.
1624	A long duration photon beam can induce macroscopic coherent effects on a plasma by single photon electron scattering if the probability of the interaction approaches 1 in a volume of unit surface and length equal to the plasma typical wavelength, and the induced electron oscillations become relativistic in few plasma cycles. A fraction of the plasma electrons is accelerated through the Wakefield mechanism by the cavities created by the photon-electron interactions and radiates through boosted betraton emission in the same cavities. The resulting emission in this framework is very similar to the typical GRB radiation. Several comparisons with GRB light curves and spectral-energy correlations will be presented.
1728	Casimir effect of a topologically nontrivial two-dimensional space-time, through Krein space quantization [1,2], has been calculated. In other words, auxiliary negative norm states have been utilized here. Presence of negative norm states play the role of an automatic renormalization device for the theory. The negative norm states (which do not interact with the physical world) could be chosen in two perspective. In the first case our method results in zero or vanishing values for energy. In the second case, however, the result are the same as the renormalization procedure.
2778	Superconducting and normal-state properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.
2794	The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is a phenomenon where the repeated measurement of a quantum system can prevent it from evolving. In this paper, the authors investigate the QZE in the context of the Decoherent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics. They show that the QZE can occur in this framework, but it is dependent on the chosen set of histories. They also find that the QZE can be used to control the decoherence of quantum systems. The authors conclude that the QZE can have practical applications in quantum technologies, such as quantum error correction.
146	The research paper discusses the coordination of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders. The study proposes a decentralized approach that enables agents to coordinate their movements without relying on a central control system. The approach uses a combination of local communication and decision-making algorithms to achieve coordination. The paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving coordination and maintaining the formation of the group of agents. The findings indicate that the decentralized approach can efficiently coordinate a group of autonomous agents with multiple leaders, even when the environment is dynamic and uncertain. The study concludes that the proposed approach is a promising solution for coordination problems in multi-agent systems.
3849	The paper explores the transresistivity of quantum Hall double layers near the filling factor $\nu=1/2$. The authors investigate Fermi-liquid effects and their impact on the transresistivity in this system. They employ a theoretical model to study the dependence of the transresistivity on temperature and magnetic field. The main focus of the paper is to understand the nature of the electron interactions in the double layers and their effects on the transport properties. The authors conclude that Fermi-liquid effects play a significant role in the transresistivity near $\nu=1/2$ and that their model provides a good description of the experimental observations.
1375	"The recent developments of the phase string theory for doped antiferromagnets will be briefly reviewed. Such theory is built upon a singular phase string effect induced by the motion of holes in a doped antiferromagnet, which as a precise property of the t-J model dictates the novel competition between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. A global phase diagram including the antiferromagnetic, superconducting, lower and upper pseudogap, and high-temperature ""normal"" phases, as well as a series of anomalous physical properties of these phases will be presented as the self-consistent and systematic consequences of the phase string theory."
2873	This research paper presents a study on the behavior of continuous interfaces in the presence of disorder, focusing on the two-dimensional case. The authors investigate the effectiveness of strong pinning, a mechanism that is commonly used to stabilize such interfaces, and find that it is not sufficient in this context. They demonstrate this through numerical simulations of the interface motion, as well as analytical calculations of the critical pinning strength required for stabilization. The results suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between disorder and pinning is needed in order to fully understand the behavior of continuous interfaces in real-world systems.
1026	We study the possibility of obtaining large nongaussian signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background in a general class of single-field nonlocal hill-top inflation models. We estimate the nonlinearity parameter f_{NL} which characterizes nongaussianity in such models and show that large nongaussianity is possible. For the recently proposed p-adic inflation model we find that f_{NL} ~ 120 when the string coupling is order unity. We show that large nongaussianity is also possible in a toy model with an action similar to those which arise in string field theory.
2909	I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans. I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.
742	This paper explores critical phenomena in complex networks, with a primary focus on understanding the behavior of such systems near the critical point of a phase transition. The authors investigate various network models and observe the emergence of power-law behaviors in the degree distributions and correlation functions. They also discuss the implications of these findings for the robustness and functionality of complex networks, highlighting the importance of understanding critical phenomena in the study and design of networked systems. Overall, the paper provides insights into the nature and behavior of complex networks, with potential applications in fields ranging from physics to computer science and beyond.
3034	This research paper investigates the performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in multihop networks with opportunistic relay selection. The primary focus is to analyze the impact of various parameters, such as number of relays, channel conditions, and power allocations, on the throughput and delay of the HARQ scheme. The paper also proposes a novel relay selection algorithm that improves the system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of throughput and delay, and the optimal number of relays and power allocation can vary depending on the channel conditions. The study concludes that HARQ with opportunistic relay selection is a promising solution for improving the performance of multihop networks.
3288	This research paper investigates the underlying causes of fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by analyzing the potential energy surface. The fragility of these mixtures is a well-known phenomenon, characterized by a rapid increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature. By exploring the potential energy surface, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics and structural changes that occur in supercooled mixtures. Our results suggest that the fragility of Lennard-Jones mixtures is closely related to the complexity of the potential energy surface, which exhibits a high degree of roughness and heterogeneity. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the behavior of supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in fields such as materials science and chemical engineering.
1748	A consistent device model to describe current-voltage characteristics of metal/insulator/metal systems is developed. In this model the insulator and the metal electrodes are described within the same theoretical framework by using density of states distributions. This approach leads to differential equations for the electric field which have to be solved in a self consistent manner by considering the continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical potential in the complete system. The model is capable of describing the current-voltage characteristics of the metal/insulator/metal system in forward and reverse bias for arbitrary values of the metal/ insulator injection barriers. In the case of high injection barriers, approximations are provided offering a tool for comparison with experiments. Numerical calculations are performed exemplary using a simplified model of an organic semiconductor.
240	This research paper investigates the ongoing process of galactic accretion, which involves the accumulation of gas and other materials into galaxies. Specifically, the paper focuses on simulations and observations of condensed gas in hot halos, which are the regions surrounding galaxies. Through computer simulations and observations, the study aims to shed light on the mechanisms that drive gas accretion in hot halos and the ways in which this process contributes to the growth and evolution of galaxies. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as for theories of dark matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.
3046	Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.
3315	We report on calculations of broadening effects in QCL due to alloy scattering. The output of numerical calculations of alloy broadened Landau levels compare favorably with calculations performed at the self-consistent Born approximation. Results for Landau level width and optical absorption are presented. A disorder activated forbidden transition becomes significant in the vicinity of crossings of Landau levels which belong to different subbands. A study of the time dependent survival probability in the lowest Landau level of the excited subband is performed. It is shown that at resonance the population relaxation occurs in a subpicosecond scale.
672	This research paper focuses on the KATRIN experiment, which aims to measure the mass of neutrinos and investigate the presence of right-handed currents in beta decay. Neutrinos are elusive particles that have a non-zero mass, and the KATRIN experiment utilizes a high-precision spectrometer to measure the endpoint of the beta decay spectrum, which is sensitive to the mass of neutrinos. Furthermore, the experiment aims to investigate the presence of right-handed currents in beta decay, which could provide insights into the nature of neutrinos and their interactions with other particles. This paper discusses the experimental setup of KATRIN, the analysis techniques used to extract the neutrino mass and right-handed currents, and the potential implications of the results for particle physics and cosmology.
2237	In this research paper, we investigate the band structure of a polaron system using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) after photodissociation of Landau-Pekar polarons. Our central focus is to understand the effect of the dissociation process on the electronic structure of the system. Our key findings reveal the emergence of a clear band in the ARPES spectra after photodissociation, which we attribute to the formation of a delocalized state due to the fragmentation of the polaron. Our conclusions suggest that the photodissociation of polarons can serve as a useful tool to explore the electronic properties of polaron systems and provide insights into the nature of their excitations.
1484	The pseudoparticle approach is a numerical technique to compute path integrals without discretizing spacetime. The basic idea is to integrate over those field configurations, which can be represented by a sum of a fixed number of localized building blocks (pseudoparticles). In a couple of previous papers we have successfully applied the pseudoparticle approach to pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. In this work we discuss how to incorporate fermionic fields in the pseudoparticle approach. To test our method, we compute the phase diagram of the 1+1-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large-N limit.
460	This research paper investigates the Wigner functions, coherent states, one-dimensional marginal probabilities, and uncertainty structures of Landau levels. Using the Wigner formalism, we derive the Wigner functions for the coherent states of the Landau Hamiltonian, and subsequently obtain the corresponding one-dimensional marginal probabilities. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional marginal probabilities are dependent on the magnetic field strength, and exhibit oscillatory behavior. We also analyze the uncertainty structures of these states, and show that they obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Our results shed light on the quantum behavior of charged particles in a magnetic field, and provide a deeper understanding of Landau levels.
1275	This research paper presents the findings of a multi-epoch VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) study of the radio galaxy 3C 66A. The central focus of the study was to investigate the variability and structural changes in the jet of 3C 66A over a period of six years. The results show that the jet underwent significant morphological changes, including the appearance of a new component and the disappearance of an existing component. These findings suggest that the variability in 3C 66A is likely due to the propagation of shocks along the jet. The study highlights the importance of multi-epoch VLBA observations in understanding the dynamics of active galactic nuclei.
2972	We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
2037	This research paper presents an analytical evaluation of the X-ray scattering contribution to imaging degradation in grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes. The study analyzes the effects of different design parameters and provides a theoretical framework for understanding the scattering contributions. The significant finding of the research is that the scattering contribution is complex and depends on various factors such as the mirror design, detector size, and energy range. The study concludes that the scattering contribution should be carefully considered in the design and optimization of X-ray telescopes to improve their imaging performance.
1245	We study the relation between PageRank and other parameters of information networks such as in-degree, out-degree, and the fraction of dangling nodes. We model this relation through a stochastic equation inspired by the original definition of PageRank. Further, we use the theory of regular variation to prove that PageRank and in-degree follow power laws with the same exponent. The difference between these two power laws is in a multiple coefficient, which depends mainly on the fraction of dangling nodes, average in-degree, the power law exponent, and damping factor. The out-degree distribution has a minor effect, which we explicitly quantify. Our theoretical predictions show a good agreement with experimental data on three different samples of the Web.
3613	This research paper investigates the periodic oscillations of dark solitons in parabolic potentials. The study explores the dynamics of dark solitons, a localized wave packet that maintains its shape while propagating in a nonlinear medium. The findings reveal that the parabolic potential induces periodic oscillations in the soliton's amplitude, phase, and velocity. These oscillations have significant implications for the soliton's stability and suggest potential applications in optical and quantum communication systems. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental properties of dark solitons in different potential landscapes.
3237	We investigate, in the context of five-dimensional (5D) Brans-Dicke theory of gravity, the idea that macroscopic matter configurations can be generated from pure vacuum in five dimensions, an approach first proposed in the framework of general relativity. We show that the 5D Brans-Dicke vacuum equations when reduced to four dimensions lead to a modified version of Brans-Dicke theory in four dimensions (4D). As an application of the formalism, we obtain two five-dimensional extensions of four-dimensional O'Hanlon and Tupper vacuum solution and show that they lead two different cosmological scenarios in 4D.
3449	Two-photon decay rates in simple atoms such as hydrogenlike systems represent rather interesting fundamental problems in atomic physics. The sum of the energies of the two emitted photons has to fulfill an energy conservation condition, the decay takes place via intermediate virtual states, and the total decay rate is obtained after an integration over the energy of one of the emitted photons. Here, we investigate cases with a virtual state having an energy intermediate between the initial and the final state of the decay process, and we show that due to non-uniform convergence, only a careful treatment of the singularities infinitesimally displaced from the photon integration contour leads to consistent and convergent results.
D2-73	"Lamarck's ""Hydrogéologie"" (1802) represents a fascinating but often overlooked contribution to early geological thought. While Lamarck is primarily remembered for his evolutionary biology theories, this work showcases his broader scientific vision. In it, he proposed that Earth's features formed through gradual processes over immense time periods—challenging the catastrophist views popular in his era. The text emphasized water's crucial role in shaping landscapes and theorized about atmospheric influences on geological formations. Notably, Lamarck's uniformitarian approach in geology paralleled his biological thinking about gradual change. Though overshadowed by his biological works and contemporaries like Cuvier, ""Hydrogéologie"" demonstrates Lamarck's cross-disciplinary thinking and his willingness to challenge scientific orthodoxy across multiple fields."
712	This research paper investigates the electronic emission properties of bi-layer novel organic semiconductor systems. The study analyzes the effect of the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer on the electronic properties of the bi-layer system.

3888	This research paper presents a parametrized post-Newtonian expansion of Chern-Simons gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity that includes a term proportional to the product of the curvature tensor and the Chern-Simons form. Using this expansion, the authors derive the equations of motion for a test particle in the presence of a spherically symmetric source. They then compare these equations to the predictions of general relativity and find that the two theories differ significantly for certain values of the parameters. This suggests that observations of gravitational waves could be used to constrain the parameters of Chern-Simons gravity and test its validity as an alternative theory of gravity.

Several candidate ions suited for these laser spectroscopy studies are presented.
1349	We consider higher-derivative perturbations of quantum gravity and quantum field theories in curved space and investigate tools to calculate counterterms and short-distance expansions of Feynman diagrams. In the case of single higher-derivative insertions we derive a closed formula that relates the perturbed one-loop counterterms to the unperturbed Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients. In the more general case, we classify the contributions to the short-distance expansion and outline a number of simplification methods. Certain difficulties of the common differential technique in the presence of higher-derivative perturbations are avoided by a systematic use of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, which in some cases reduces the computational effort considerably.

2821	Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.

Our findings suggest that the Ds0*(2317) meson is a promising candidate for studying the properties of DK-molecules and can provide insights into the strong and radiative decays of mesons.
D2-7	Spermidine synthases are essential enzymes that function as aminopropyltransferases, transferring aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structurally, these enzymes contain a SAM-MT fold and typically form homodimers. The mechanism follows an SN2 reaction pathway where spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine The human spermidine synthase is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor.

The parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both TE and TM waves. It is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the TE waves. Various limiting cases are considered. The results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium.
2905	We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.

The paper concludes that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in particle physics and provides a basis for understanding the origin of particle mass. It also highlights the importance of experimental verification in confirming theoretical predictions.
2654	We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately, sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another ``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.
3819	The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.

1968	The dual observation of the Omega production in central Au+Au collisions having both an exponential p_T distribution and also associated particles above the background has been referred to as the Omega puzzle. We give a quantitative description of how that puzzle can be understood in terms of phantom jets, where only ridges without peaks are produced to give rise to both the Omega trigger and its associated particles. In the framework of recombination of thermal partons we are able to reproduce both the \Delta\phi distribution and the trigger-momentum dependence of the yield of the associated particles. We make predictions on other observables that can be checked by further analyses of the data.

The authors also analyze the performance of their proposed approach using simulation experiments and show that it outperforms other commonly used decision-making mechanisms in P2P networks. They conclude that acyclic preference systems can be a promising solution for decentralized decision-making in P2P networks, as they provide a flexible and efficient way to handle individual preferences while avoiding conflicts and cycles."
2438	"We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium. The general nature of the solution is similar to the ""Bondi solution"", but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars."
2957	The Flory-Huggins theory has been widely used to predict the solubility of polymers in solution. However, this theory has limited applicability to heterogeneously-modified polymers due to the lack of a clear understanding of the intermolecular interactions of the modified segments. This paper explores the use of the Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified polymers and proposes modifications to the theory to account for these interactions. The study includes both theoretical and experimental approaches to validate the proposed modifications and demonstrates the improved accuracy of the modified Flory-Huggins theory in predicting the solubility behavior of heterogeneously-modified polymers. This research provides insight into the behavior of complex polymer systems and could have implications for the design of new materials with tailored properties.

Two kinds of spin chains, the Ising spin chain and XY spin chain, are considered. We calculate and analyze the effects of system-chain coupling on the LZ transition. A relation between the LZ transition and the critical points of the spin chain is established. These results suggest that LZ transitions may serve as the witnesses of criticality of the spin chain. This may provide a new way to study quantum phase transitions as well as LZ transitions.
2648	In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued k-variate function h calculated at all possible sets of k points from a random sample. In the present paper we investigate the corresponding extreme value analogue, which we shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample. U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric invariants.

The main aims are the study of the star formation and O and WR stellar populations in these galaxies and the role that interactions between low surface companion objects have in the triggering of the bursts. We analyze the morphology, stellar populations, physical conditions, chemical abundances and kinematics of the ionized gas, as well as the star-formation activity of each system.
4028	The research paper investigates the nucleation and growth of multiple metastable phases in a generalized Potts model. The study finds that the competitive nucleation of multiple phases can lead to a violation of the Ostwald rule, which states that the most stable phase is the first to nucleate and grow. Instead, the less stable phase can become dominant due to its faster nucleation rate. The research also shows that the nucleation and growth behavior can be influenced by the system's parameters, such as the size of the critical nucleus. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex nucleation and growth phenomena in materials science and highlights the importance of considering multiple metastable phases in modeling these processes.

This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the fragmentation process and can inform the development of new models for predicting fragment distributions in a variety of contexts. The research also highlights the importance of careful experimental design and data analysis in studying complex physical phenomena. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the value of studying the distribution of the BF in advancing our understanding of fragmentation and related phenomena.

Overall, this research paper provides a detailed analysis of the q-deformed spin foam models and their potential implications for the field of quantum gravity.
D2-86	Robotic education is nothing but the Hybrid Education that is provided to students, education when integrated with technology and coding is called as Robotic education. Robotic education is far better than the traditional educational system because of it instructional based teaching. Coding is not preparing an application, it is just understanding the instructions in a sequence and then execution them in a way we need the result. Coding allows the users to create something, traditional education is all about learning that is there in book, where creativity, critical thinking, programming is neglected. As robotic education is based on algorithm (set of programmed instructions to execute in sequence) it triggers students to go one step ahead.
2435	"""The Epps effect revisited"" is a research paper that aims to revisit the Epps effect, a phenomenon in finance that refers to the tendency of volatility to cluster in financial markets.

The paper concludes that the Epps effect is a persistent and robust feature of financial markets, and its magnitude varies across asset classes and time periods. The study also finds evidence of a positive relationship between the Epps effect and market liquidity. The authors suggest that the Epps effect has important implications for risk management and asset pricing, particularly for investors who rely on historical volatility estimates to make investment decisions."
1077	We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived a graded refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the light deflection in a gravitational field can be calculated correctly with the use of this refractive index and therefore the gravitational lensing can be treated conveniently with the optical method. For illustration, we simulated the imaging of gravitational lensing, figured out the time delay between the two images and calculated the lens mass in a conventional optical way.
3154	In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main results in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.

The paper concludes that VLBI is a powerful tool for identifying and studying IFRSs, and further observations could provide insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies.
D2-47	Systems Biology is not one thing, and is quite different to different people. In my view Systems Biology is really a modern perspective on doing basic Biology research. It is not really an applied field, intending to directly be useful for industry and make products. Instead it aims to unlock the key principles of life, which can be used to do that thereafter. However, a lot of the processes of Systems Biology involves using cutting edge tools, especially computational ones, which can give you a good handle on the process of being a “data scientist”, handling large amount of experimentally obtained data, processing and analyzing it to make decisions about future course of actions.
3202	This research paper explores the use of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (KCC) as a measure of randomness in short sequences.

The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the KCC for short sequences, showing that it can be an effective measure of randomness even for sequences of only a few bits. The authors also discuss the limitations of the KCC for short sequences, and propose several modifications to improve its accuracy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the study of randomness and complexity in computational systems.

2031	In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.
2755	We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.

The study finds that the post-Minkowski corrections have a significant impact on the motion of the particles, altering their orbital parameters such as the radius and frequency. The authors conclude that the post-Minkowski corrections must be taken into account when analyzing the motion of particles in circular orbits, particularly in the context of high-precision experiments or astrophysical scenarios.

The research uses a combination of experimental and analytical methods to study the flow behavior of lubricants and proposes a unified model that can account for both film thickness and traction in EHD lubrication. The results of this research provide valuable insights into the behavior of lubricants under high-pressure conditions and can be applied in the design of efficient lubrication systems for various mechanical applications.

Overall, the article contributes to the field of differential geometry and provides a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of Riemannian foliations."
2049	Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we find a reasonable agreement.
3998	"This research paper aims to provide a quantitative resolution to some ""absolute discrepancies"" in cancer theories by examining the Phage lambda genetic switch. The study utilizes mathematical modeling and statistical analysis to investigate the mechanisms behind the switch's behavior, particularly in relation to cancer development and progression. The research findings suggest that the switch's dynamics can explain certain aspects of cancer, such as tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance. The study's outcomes provide crucial insights into cancer biology and may have implications for the development of more effective cancer therapies. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of cancer and highlights the importance of quantitative approaches in unraveling complex biological phenomena."
D2-13	Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.
160	There is a large literature devoted to the problem of finding an optimal (min-cost) prefix-free code with an unequal letter-cost encoding alphabet of size. While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to optimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon the largest encoding letter size. This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the encoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the previous analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm that works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite alphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best previous ones known.
345	"The research paper titled ""Observing the gas temperature drop in the high-density nucleus of L 1544"" focuses on analyzing the temperature distribution in the nucleus of the L1544 molecular cloud using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The results of the study show that the gas temperature in the high-density region drops by a factor of two, which can be explained by the depletion of gas-phase CO molecules onto dust grains. This phenomenon is significant as it suggests that chemical and physical processes are tightly coupled in molecular clouds, affecting their evolution and star formation potential. The study highlights the importance of observing temperature gradients in molecular clouds to better understand their internal dynamics and evolution."
567	"The research paper titled ""Single NanoParticle Photothermal Tracking (SNaPT) of 5 nm gold beads in live cells"" presents a novel technique for tracking the movement of individual nanoparticles in live cells. The technique, called SNaPT, uses photothermal imaging to detect the heat generated by a gold nanoparticle as it moves through the cell. The researchers applied SNaPT to track 5 nm gold beads in live HeLa cells and observed the beads moving in a random, Brownian-like motion. The study demonstrates the potential of SNaPT for studying the dynamics of nanoparticles in live cells and provides insights into the behavior of nanoparticles in biological systems. The paper highlights the importance of developing new techniques for tracking nanoparticles in living systems, which will be critical for advancing the field of nanomedicine."
2091	"The paper titled ""Settling the Complexity of Computing Two-Player Nash Equilibria"" focuses on determining the computational complexity of finding Nash equilibria in two-player games. The authors present a breakthrough result showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game is a problem that belongs to the class of problems known as PPAD-complete. This has significant implications for the field of game theory and computational complexity, as it settles a long-standing open question and provides a more complete understanding of the computational complexity of finding Nash equilibria in two-player games. The findings in this paper will be useful for researchers working in game theory, algorithmic game theory, and related areas, and may also have practical applications in fields such as economics and political science."
3854	Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.
1986	This research paper investigates the use of the average transverse momentum ($p_t$) as a probe of high energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dynamics. By analyzing experimental data from high energy proton-proton collisions, we demonstrate that the average $p_t$ is sensitive to the underlying QCD processes that govern the production of particles in these collisions. Specifically, we find that the behavior of the average $p_t$ is consistent with the predictions of perturbative QCD at high $p_t$, while at lower $p_t$ it deviates from this behavior, indicating the presence of non-perturbative effects. Our results provide a valuable tool for probing the fundamental nature of QCD at high energies and offer new insights into the behavior of particle production in high energy collisions.
D2-65	Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term.
1683	This research paper presents hydrodynamical simulations of the jet in the symbiotic star MWC 560 III, with a focus on understanding X-ray jets in symbiotic stars. The simulations reveal that the jet is highly collimated and has a strong shock structure, which is consistent with observations of similar systems. The results also suggest that the jet is likely powered by accretion onto a compact object, such as a white dwarf or neutron star. The study provides important insights into the physics of symbiotic star jets and their contribution to the overall energy budget of these systems. Overall, the findings of this research paper have significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of X-ray jets in symbiotic stars.
3435	We study the constraints imposed by the Hadamard condition on the two-point function of local states of a scalar quantum field conformally coupled to a gravitational background. We propose a method to assign a stress tensor to the state-dependent part of the two point function which arises as a conserved tensor with an anomalous trace. To characterize the local Hadamard states of physical interest we apply a super-selection rule relating this quantum stress tensor to the matter stress tensor of a conformal invariant gravitational model subject to a conformal symmetry breaking term. This implies that the determination of a Hadamard state may be considered as an integral part of its gravitational coupling via the back-reaction effect.
3189	"The research paper titled ""Modal Extraction in Spatially Extended Systems"" explores the modal analysis of spatially extended systems, such as beams and plates. The authors review the various modal extraction techniques used in these systems, including the finite element method and the Fourier transform method. They then propose a new approach based on the wavelet transform method, which is shown to be more accurate and efficient. The paper concludes that the wavelet transform method is a promising technique for modal analysis in spatially extended systems, and it can be used to improve the accuracy of structural models for various applications."
632	We determine from Polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity. Their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Moreover we study the inverse decay length of the correlation between the real parts and between the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compare the results with expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.
1753	This research paper investigates the quantum pump effect in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions. The quantum pump effect is a phenomenon that occurs in systems with time-dependent potentials, where a net charge current is generated without the application of an external bias voltage. The authors use a tight-binding model to study the pump effect in a one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon, finding that the pump effect is robust against disorder and can be tuned by adjusting the system parameters. They also show that the pump effect is sensitive to the Fermi energy and the frequency of the driving potential. The paper concludes that the one-dimensional Dirac fermion system is a promising platform for studying the quantum pump effect and its potential applications in nanoelectronics.
3766	This research paper explores alternative approaches to understanding the equilibrium properties of hard-sphere liquids. The main objective is to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of different methods for calculating the thermodynamic properties of these liquids, including the radial distribution function, pressure, and compressibility. Using computer simulations and analytical techniques, we compare the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics simulations, and integral equation theories. Our findings reveal that while each method has its advantages and limitations, integral equation theories provide the most accurate and efficient approach for calculating the thermodynamic properties of hard-sphere liquids over a wide range of densities and temperatures. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of processes involving hard-sphere liquids, such as colloidal suspensions and nanoparticle dispersions.
2705	This research paper focuses on the large-scale structures in the universe and the origin of galaxies. The paper presents a comprehensive study of the various structures in the universe, including clusters, superclusters, filaments, and voids. The paper also discusses the current theories and models that explain the formation and evolution of galaxies within these structures. The outcomes of the study suggest that the distribution of galaxies and other cosmic structures is strongly influenced by dark matter and dark energy. The paper concludes that further research and observations are necessary to fully understand the complex processes that shape the structure of the universe.
3614	We report on use of a radiation pressure induced restoring force, the optical spring effect, to optically dilute the mechanical damping of a 1 gram suspended mirror, which is then cooled by active feedback (cold damping). Optical dilution relaxes the limit on cooling imposed by mechanical losses, allowing the oscillator mode to reach a minimum temperature of 6.9 mK, a factor of ~40000 below the environmental temperature. A further advantage of the optical spring effect is that it can increase the number of oscillations before decoherence by several orders of magnitude. In the present experiment we infer an increase in the dynamical lifetime of the state by a factor of ~200.
1957	Topological T-duality is a transformation taking a gerbe on a principal torus bundle to a gerbe on a principal dual-torus bundle. We give a new geometric construction of T-dualization, which allows the duality to be extended in following two directions. First, bundles of groups other than tori, even bundles of some nonabelian groups, can be dualized. Second, bundles whose duals are families of noncommutative groups (in the sense of noncommutative geometry) can be treated, though in this case the base space of the bundles is best viewed as a topological stack. Some methods developed for the construction may be of independent interest. These are a Pontryagin type duality that interchanges commutative principal bundles with gerbes, a nonabelian Takai type duality for groupoids, and the computation of certain equivariant Brauer groups.
861	This research paper presents a finite element method for solving the time-independent Schroedinger equation, which is widely used in quantum mechanics. The primary focus is on developing an accurate and efficient numerical method for solving this equation. The remarkable finding is that the proposed method is capable of producing highly accurate results with a relatively small number of elements. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, which can be used to solve other quantum mechanical problems efficiently. The conclusion of the study is that the finite element method is a promising approach for solving the Schroedinger equation.
3425	This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves warping the prototype template to match the localized objects. The algorithm is presented along with the results of four example applications using MRI, x-ray and ultrasound images.
729	"Plasma instabilities can play a fundamental role in quark-gluon plasma equilibration in the high energy (weak coupling) limit. Early simulations of the evolution of plasma instabilities in non-abelian gauge theory, performed in one spatial dimension, found behavior qualitatively similar to traditional QED plasmas. Later simulations of the fully three-dimensional theory found different behavior, unlike traditional QED plasmas. To shed light on the origin of this difference, we study the intermediate case of two spatial dimensions. Depending on how the ""two-dimensional'' theory is formulated, we can obtain either behavior."
D2-43	Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. . In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from.
587	This research paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of an integral gated mode single photon detector (SPD) at telecom wavelengths. The device is based on a planar silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) and a CMOS integrated circuit (IC) for gate control and signal processing. The integral design allows for a compact and efficient device with high photon detection efficiency (PDE) and low dark count rate (DCR). The characterization results show that the SPD has a PDE of 15% at 1550 nm wavelength, a timing jitter of 65 ps, and a DCR of 10 Hz. The device is suitable for applications in quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. The integral design and high performance make this SPD a promising candidate for future quantum technologies.
1462	This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier. Using the virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier, the output of the magnetoelectric measurement system is extensively rich in magnetoelectric coupling behaviors, including coupling strength and phase lag, under various dc bias magnetic field and ac magnetic field.
2586	This research paper focuses on the development of realizable Hamiltonians for universal adiabatic quantum computers. The authors explore various techniques for constructing these Hamiltonians and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of computational performance. Noteworthy results include the identification of a specific class of Hamiltonians that can be used for universal quantum computing and the demonstration of their superiority over other approaches. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the future of quantum computing and the potential for practical applications in fields such as cryptography and optimization.
2233	This paper examines the potential effects of mergers on the mass scaling relations between black holes, galaxies, and other gravitationally bound systems. We analyze data from various surveys and simulations to investigate the impact of mergers on the growth and evolution of these systems. Our results suggest that mergers can significantly alter the mass scaling relations, leading to deviations from the expected relationships. We also explore the implications of these findings for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes, and discuss the key factors that may influence the effects of mergers on mass scaling relations. Overall, this study provides important insights into the complex interplay between mergers and the dynamics of gravitationally bound systems, with potential implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.
3958	We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) gates.
3822	This research paper explores the dynamics of two-field inflation, specifically focusing on the effects of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We investigate the interplay between these perturbations during the early universe and their impact on the cosmic microwave background radiation. By analyzing different inflationary models, we find that the relative importance of curvature and isocurvature perturbations depends on the specific parameters of the model, such as the initial conditions and the mass ratio of the two fields. Our results shed light on the theoretical and observational implications of two-field inflation and provide valuable insights for future cosmological studies.
3962	We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially, this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.
1573	This research paper provides a gentle introduction to the combinatorial techniques used in boson normal ordering. Normal ordering is a crucial tool in quantum mechanics, and the combinatorial methods used in this paper can simplify calculations significantly. The paper explores various combinatorial techniques, such as generating functions, partitions, and Young tableaux, to derive normal ordered expressions for various bosonic systems. The primary finding of this paper is that combinatorics can be a powerful tool to simplify boson normal ordering, leading to more efficient calculations. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of combinatorial techniques in quantum mechanics and suggesting avenues for further research in this area.
3033	This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
3000	"The research paper titled ""Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement"" explores a new method for entangling independent photons using time measurement. The central theme of the paper is to investigate the possibility of entangling photons without the need for physical interaction. The researchers propose a method in which two independent photons are sent through a beam splitter and their time difference is measured. By manipulating the time delay, the photons become entangled, showing a strong correlation between their polarization states. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through experiments and simulations, highlighting the potential for practical applications in quantum communication. The most important conclusion from the research is that time measurement can serve as a viable method for entangling independent photons, providing a new avenue for exploring the phenomenon of quantum entanglement."
2253	"The research paper titled ""Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations"" explores the relationship between protein mutational robustness and population size in evolutionary processes. The main focus of the study is to determine whether larger populations have a higher rate of mutations in proteins that confer increased robustness. The key findings suggest that larger populations have a higher rate of mutations that increase protein robustness, indicating that evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations. The study suggests that this phenomenon is due to the increased opportunity for beneficial mutations to spread and become fixed in larger populations. The conclusions of the paper highlight the importance of population size in evolutionary processes and the potential for mutational robustness to play a significant role in the adaptation of proteins to changing environments."
3494	The main result of this paper is a quasi-hamiltonian analogue of a special case of the O'Shea-Sjamaar convexity theorem for usual momentum maps. We denote by U a simply connected compact connected Lie group and we fix an involutive automorphism of maximal rank on this Lie group (such an automorphism always exists). We then denote by M a quasi-hamiltonian U-space and we prove that the image under the momentum map of the fixed-point set of a form-reversing compatible involution of M is a convex polytope, which is in fact equal to the full momentum polytope. This theorem was announced in arXiv:math/0609517v1. As an application, we obtain an example of lagrangian subspace in representation spaces of surface groups.
22	Using operator algebraic methods we show that the moment generating function of charge transport in a system with infinitely many non-interacting Fermions is given by a determinant of a certain operator in the one-particle Hilbert space. The formula is equivalent to a formula of Levitov and Lesovik in the finite dimensional case and may be viewed as its regularized form in general. Our result embodies two tenets often realized in mesoscopic physics, namely, that the transport properties are essentially independent of the length of the leads and of the depth of the Fermi sea.
2559	This research paper delves into the thermodynamics of black holes with quantum corrections taken into account to all orders in the Planck length. The study highlights the significance of the Planck length in understanding the behavior of black holes and their thermodynamic properties. The paper establishes that incorporating quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of black holes leads to a modification of the conventional laws of thermodynamics. The critical outcome of this research is the determination of the corrected expressions for the entropy, temperature, and heat capacity of black holes. The conclusions drawn from this study have far-reaching implications for the understanding of black hole thermodynamics, quantum gravity, and the fundamental laws of physics.
2796	"The research paper titled ""Green function theory versus Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for thin magnetic films"" compares two different methods for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. The main subject of the paper is to determine which method is more accurate and efficient for this type of calculation. The key finding of the paper is that both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but overall, the Quantum Monte Carlo method is more accurate for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. However, the Green function theory method is still useful for providing insight into the underlying physics of the system. The paper concludes that both methods should be used in conjunction with each other for a more complete understanding of the magnetic properties of thin films."
1522	The classical Ehresmann-Bruhat order describes the possible degenerations of a pair of flags in a finite-dimensional vector space V; or, equivalently, the closure of an orbit of the group GL(V) acting on the direct product of two full flag varieties. We obtain a similar result for triples consisting of two subspaces and a partial flag in V; this is equivalent to describing the closure of a GL(V)-orbit in the product of two Grassmannians and one flag variety. We give a rank criterion to check whether such a triple can be degenerated to another one, and we classify the minimal degenerations. Our methods involve only elementary linear algebra and combinatorics of graphs (originating in Auslander-Reiten quivers).
159	We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability obtained by optimal schemes.
2279	This research paper investigates the application of quantum filtering techniques on optical coherent states. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the accuracy and precision of optical measurements. The research employs mathematical models and simulations to explore the performance of quantum filters in different scenarios, such as noisy environments and limited measurement capabilities. The results indicate that quantum filtering can significantly enhance the quality of optical measurements, leading to improved signal-to-noise ratios and reduced measurement uncertainties. The study concludes that quantum filtering techniques hold great potential for advancing the field of optical sensing and metrology.
3834	"The paper ""Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry"" presents a new approach to solving algebraic geometry problems using saturated and positive integer programming. The authors introduce the concept of a ""flip"" in algebraic geometry and propose a method for computing flips using these techniques. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to several examples in representation theory, including the computation of the Gromov-Witten invariants for the Grassmannian variety. The paper concludes by discussing the potential implications of this work for the field of algebraic geometry and its applications in other areas of mathematics."
737	We introduce a simple quantum mechanical model in which time and space are discrete and periodic. These features avoid the complications related to continuous-spectrum operators and infinite-norm states. The model provides a tool for discussing the probabilistic interpretation of generally-covariant quantum systems, without the confusion generated by spurious infinities. We use the model to illustrate the formalism of general-relativistic quantum mechanics, and to test the definition of multiple-event probability introduced in a companion paper. We consider a version of the model with unitary time-evolution and a version without unitary time-evolution
43	A recent radio survey of globular clusters has increased the number of millisecond pulsars drastically. M28 is now the globular cluster with the third largest population of known pulsars, after Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc. This prompted us to revisit the archival Chandra data on M28 to evaluate whether the newly discovered millisecond pulsars find a counterpart among the various X-ray sources detected in M28 previously. The radio position of PSR J1824-2452H is found to be in agreement with the position of CXC 182431-245217 while some faint unresolved X-ray emission near to the center of M28 is found to be coincident with the millisecond pulsars PSR J1824-2452G, J1824-2452J, J1824-2452I and J1824-2452E.
D2-58	The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded in a process called inflation. As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental particles and then atoms formed, eventually leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (leftover heat from the early universe) and the abundance of light elements, strongly supports this theory. The Big Bang also explains the universe's large-scale structure and the observed redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates the ongoing expansion of space.
858	We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT. The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the Chellas' STIT.
3540	Holzer and Holzer (Discrete Applied Mathematics 144(3):345--358, 2004) proved that the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the solution, which implies that the unique Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP.
914	Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are variable on a wide range of timescales, though relatively few systematic variability surveys have been conducted. Previous broad-band (both spectral and temporal) variability surveys of AGN are limited in their temporal and spectral bandwidth, despite their promise for probing the central engine and black hole mass. We outline optimal properties for variability studies and provide a brief summary of three new variability surveys, two (BATSS and DASCH) about to begin and the third (EXIST) possible within the next decade, which will open new windows on the physics and fundamental properties of AGN.
1290	This research paper explores the concept of biordered superconductivity and the strong pseudogap state in high-temperature superconductors. The primary theme of the paper is the investigation of the coexistence of two different types of order in the same material. The authors propose a theoretical model that explains the emergence of biordered superconductivity and its relationship to the pseudogap state. They conclude that the biordered state is a distinct phase of matter with unique properties, and its study may lead to new insights into the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity.
3050	"In this topical review I revisit the ""chromospheric flare."" This should currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone, but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems."
D1-20	No level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even low levels of alcohol use can increase the risk of certain cancers and other health problems. While some guidelines suggest limits to reduce risks, these guidelines are based on minimizing risk rather than ensuring safety. Recent research indicates that even moderate drinking may increase the risk of chronic diseases and premature death compared to abstaining. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether. Alcohol consumption significantly impacts mental health, often exacerbating existing conditions and contributing to new ones. Alcohol initially acts as a depressant, reducing inhibitions and creating a temporary sense of relaxation or confidence.
337	We review recent results from the X-ray timing of accreting millisecond pulsars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries. This is the first time a timing analysis is performed on accreting millisecond pulsars, and for the first time we can obtain information on the behavior of a very fast pulsar subject to accretion torques. We find both spin-up and spin-down behaviors, from which, using available models for the accretion torques, we derive information on the mass accretion rate and magnetic field of the neutron star in these systems. We also find that the phase delays behavior as a function of time in these sources is sometimes quite complex and difficult to interpret, since phase shifts, most probably driven by variations of the X-ray flux, are sometimes present.
1606	Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T Tauri Stars (TTS) are still not well understood. Important new insight came recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a unique 10-day long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST). Based mainly on the results of these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.
1384	This research paper focuses on the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB), which is a diffuse emission of gamma rays originating from outside of our galaxy. The paper provides an overview of the current understanding of the EGB, including its spectral and spatial characteristics, and discusses the various astrophysical sources that contribute to it. The paper also highlights some of the recent advancements in gamma-ray observations and modeling, which have led to improved measurements of the EGB and a better understanding of its origins. The main conclusion of this research is that the EGB is likely produced by a combination of unresolved extragalactic sources, including blazars, star-forming galaxies, and possibly dark matter annihilation.
1582	Here we present a problem related to the local Hamiltonian problem (identifying whether the ground state energy falls within one of two ranges) which is restricted to being translationally invariant. We prove that for problems with a fixed local dimension and O(\log(N))-body local terms, or local dimension N and 2-body terms, there are instances of the problem which are QMA-complete. We discuss the implications for the computational complexity of finding ground states of these systems, and hence for any classical approximation techniques that one could apply including DMRG, Matrix Product States and MERA. One important example is a 1D lattice of bosons with nearest-neighbor hopping at constant filling fraction i.e. a generalization of the Bose-Hubbard model.
3455	The electromagnetic field inside a cubic cavity filled up with a linear magnetodielectric medium and in the presence of external charges is quantized by modelling the magnetodielectric medium with two independent quantum fields. Electric and magnetic polarization densities of the medium are defined in terms of the ladder operators of the medium and eigenmodes of the cavity. Maxwell and constitutive equations of the medium together with the equation of motion of the charged particles have been obtained from the Heisenberg equations using a minimal coupling scheme. Spontaneous emission of a two level atom embedded in a magnetodielectric medium is calculated in terms of electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium and the Green function of the cubic cavity as an application of the model.
1604	We address the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in modeling the occurrence of power-law city size distributions. As an explanation of the result of Zipf's rank analysis, Simon's model is presented in a mathematically elementary way, with a thorough discussion of the involved hypotheses. Emphasis is put on the flexibility of the model, as to its possible extensions and the relaxation of some strong assumptions. We point out some open problems regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may be tackled by means of such extensions.
D1-19	There seems to be some merit to having a single daily glass of red wine, it seems to have something called resveratrol, which acts as an antioxidant and is thought to be good for your heart. Additionally, Italian researchers found that moderate beer drinkers had a 42 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to non-drinkers. For maximum protection, keep your consumption to one pint—at around 5 percent alcohol by volume—a day, the researchers say. Basically, alcohol, in moderation, appears to lower risks of heart and other cardiovascular disease.But this is in moderation, mind you. Just as with everything else, the only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. A beer a day is good; twelve is not.
3063	Superconducting microcoolers are critical components of modern cryogenic systems, enabling the cooling of small-scale devices to ultra-low temperatures. In this paper, we present a novel approach to microcooling based on the concept of information entropy. Specifically, we propose a design for an information entropic superconducting microcooler that can achieve unprecedented levels of cooling power and efficiency. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through numerical simulations and discuss the potential applications of this technology in various fields, including quantum computing and nanoelectronics. Our results suggest that information entropic microcoolers have the potential to revolutionize the field of cryogenic cooling, enabling the development of more efficient and powerful cooling systems for a wide range of applications.
838	We study a variational model for a diblock-copolymer/homopolymer blend. The energy functional is a sharp-interface limit of a generalisation of the Ohta-Kawasaki energy. In one dimension, on the real line and on the torus, we prove existence of minimisers of this functional and we describe in complete detail the structure and energy of stationary points. Furthermore we characterise the conditions under which the minimisers may be non-unique. In higher dimensions we construct lower and upper bounds on the energy of minimisers, and explicitly compute the energy of spherically symmetric configurations.
667	A hybrid ferromagnet/semiconductor device is used to determine a lower bound on the spin lifetime for conduction electrons in silicon. We use spin precession to self-consistently measure the drift velocity vs. drift field of spin-polarized electrons and use this electronic control to change the transit time between electron injection and detection. A measurement of normalized magnetocurrent as a function of drift velocity is used with a simple exponential-decay model to argue that the lifetime obtained (~2 ns) is artificially lowered by electronic effects and is likely orders of magnitude higher.
501	Dense granular matter has to expand in order to flow, a phenomenon known as dilatancy. Here we perform, by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, direct measurements of the evolution of the local packing density of a slow and smooth granular shear flow generated in a split-bottomed geometry. The dilatancy is found to be surprisingly strong. The dilated zone follow the region of large strain rate and slowly spreads as a function of time. This suggests that the local packing density is governed by the total amount of local strain experienced since the start of the experiment.
2126	This research paper examines the phenomenon of scaling anomaly in a cosmic string background. The study focuses on the emergence of a non-trivial scaling behavior in the correlation functions of the string, which is found to be related to the presence of a conformal anomaly. The research employs a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the scaling behavior and its implications on the properties of cosmic strings. The outcomes of this study reveal that the scaling anomaly has important consequences for the cosmic string network, affecting the formation of structure and the distribution of energy. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of cosmic strings and their role in the structure of the universe.
3720	This research paper explores the phenomenon of topology change of black holes, which occurs when the topology of the event horizon transitions from a spherical shape to a non-spherical shape. Through extensive simulations and mathematical modelling, the paper presents evidence that this topology change is a common occurrence in the evolution of black holes. The paper also argues that this phenomenon may have significant implications for our understanding of gravitational waves and the structure of the universe. Ultimately, the paper concludes that topology change of black holes is an important area of study that warrants further research and investigation.
3747	In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
3572	The objective of this research paper is to study the uniqueness domains of parallel manipulators in their workspace. The paper first defines the concept of uniqueness domains and presents a method to compute them for different types of parallel manipulators. The study then investigates the impact of design parameters, such as link lengths and joint angles, on the size and shape of the uniqueness domains. Key results indicate that the size and shape of the uniqueness domains vary significantly with changes in the design parameters. The paper also highlights the importance of uniqueness domains in the design and control of parallel manipulators. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of parallel manipulators and can aid in the optimization of their design for specific applications.
2703	"The research paper titled ""Fracture of complex metallic alloys: An atomistic study of model systems"" investigates the fracture behavior of metallic alloys at the atomic level. The authors use model systems to study the effect of different factors such as composition, crystal structure, and atomic bonding on the fracture behavior of complex metallic alloys. The study reveals that the fracture behavior of complex metallic alloys is strongly influenced by the presence of defects and their interactions with the surrounding atoms. The results suggest that the design of metallic alloys with improved fracture resistance can be achieved by controlling the composition and crystal structure of the material. The study provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of fracture in complex metallic alloys and can be useful for the development of new materials with enhanced mechanical properties."
3567	This research paper explores the microscopic origin of magnetic ferroelectrics in nonlinear multiferroics. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the relationship between magnetism and ferroelectricity at a microscopic level. The paper also aims to understand the underlying physics of nonlinear multiferroics and their potential applications. The essential findings of the paper suggest that the coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters arises from the spin-orbit coupling and the lattice distortion. The paper concludes that the understanding of the microscopic origin of magnetic ferroelectrics in nonlinear multiferroics can lead to the development of new materials with enhanced multifunctionality for technological applications.
364	We present an one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo model for capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The model quantitatively describes the central part of the discharge. For a given voltage and pressure, it self-consistently determines the electric potential and the distribution functions for electrons, negatively charged atomic oxygen, and positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used collision cross sections are critically assessed and in some cases modified. Provided associative detachment due to metastable oxygen molecules is included in the model, the electro-negativities in the center of the discharge are in excellent agreement with experiments. Due to lack of empirical data for the cross section of this process, we propose a simple model and discuss its limitations.
1495	This research paper investigates charge ordering in the organic conductor \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4. The authors demonstrate that both electron correlation effects and lattice distortions play a cooperative role in the charge ordering phenomenon. They have used various experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, resistivity measurements, and Raman spectroscopy to study the charge ordering behavior. The study concludes that the charge ordering in this material is a result of a competition between Coulomb repulsion and lattice energy, which can be tuned by external stimuli such as pressure or temperature.
1280	This research paper explores the use of heavy-tailed distributions in the training of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using the UCI Thyroid Disease Database as a case study. The study shows that the use of heavy-tailed distributions can significantly reduce the training time of MLPs while maintaining or improving the accuracy of the model. The study also demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting the hyperparameters of the MLPs to achieve optimal performance. Overall, the findings suggest that heavy-tailed distributions can be an effective tool for improving the efficiency of MLP training.
2174	This paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of highly-committed, well-connected opinion leaders endowed with a strong convincing power. Each individual, located at a vertex of a directed graph, is characterized by her name, the list of people she is interacting with, her level of awareness, and her opinion. Various temporal evolutions according to different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the formation of strongly polarized subgroups, each adopting the opinion of one of the two groups of opinion leaders, is favored.
1992	This research paper focuses on improving the actions and asymptotic scaling in lattice Yang-Mills theory. The study utilizes a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the relationship between the lattice spacing and the energy of the system. The results indicate that by introducing a new discretization scheme, the asymptotic scaling can be improved, leading to a more accurate description of the system's behavior at large distances. The research also identifies critical outcomes, including the importance of considering higher-order terms in the action and the need to account for finite volume effects. The conclusions highlight the potential of the proposed approach to enhance the understanding of the behavior of gauge theories and contribute to the development of efficient numerical simulations.
445	Spherically symmetric transonic accretion of a fractal medium has been studied in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary transonic solution is greatly sensitive to infinitesimal deviations in the outer boundary condition, but the flow becomes transonic and stable, when its evolution is followed through time. The evolution towards transonicity is more pronounced for a fractal medium than what is it for a continuum. The dynamic approach also shows that there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of motion for a perturbation in the flow, and the metric of an analogue acoustic black hole. The stationary inflow solutions of a fractal medium are as much stable under the influence of linearised perturbations, as they are for the fluid continuum.
1508	We study atom scattering from two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates using a position sensitive, time resolved, single atom detector. In analogy to quantum optics, the process can also be thought of as spontaneous, degenerate four wave mixing of de Broglie waves. We find a clear correlation between atoms with opposite momenta, demonstrating pair production in the scattering process. We also observe a Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation for collinear momenta, which permits an independent measurement of the size of the pair production source and thus the size of the spatial mode. The back to back pairs occupy very nearly two oppositely directed spatial modes, a promising feature for future quantum optics experiments.
D2-76	Phthalates or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably. Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers. Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most  known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
556	We present the observation of optical fields carrying squeezed vacuum states at sideband frequencies from 10Hz to above 35MHz. The field was generated with type-I optical parametric oscillation below threshold at 1064nm. A coherent, unbalanced classical modulation field at 40MHz enabled the generation of error signals for stable phase control of the squeezed vacuum field with respect to a strong local oscillator. Broadband squeezing of approximately -4dB was measured with balanced homodyne detection. The spectrum of the squeezed field allows a quantum noise reduction of ground-based gravitational wave detectors over their full detection band, regardless of whether homodyne readout or radio-frequency heterodyne readout is used.
2962	We determine the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U at half-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases. For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in the usual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to a spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition to a novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspond to an incommensurate singlet superconductor.
1473	The paper investigates the ground-state magneto-optical resonances in cesium vapor confined in an extremely thin cell. The researchers observe a strong dependence of the resonance signals on the cell thickness, which is attributed to the interaction of the vapor with the cell walls. The results also demonstrate the potential for using these resonances for high-precision magnetometry and atomic spectroscopy in a compact and portable device. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the behavior of cesium vapor in thin cells, which could have important implications for future applications in quantum technology.
2602	This research paper investigates the obscured X-ray source population in the HELLAS2XMM survey by analyzing data from the Spitzer telescope. The researchers find that a significant portion of the X-ray sources are obscured by dust and gas, and that the majority of these sources are likely to be active galactic nuclei. Additionally, they find that the Spitzer data allows for a more precise determination of the properties of these obscured sources, providing valuable insights into the evolution of galaxies and black holes. Overall, this study highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations for a comprehensive understanding of the X-ray source population.
971	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of planetary migration to large radii, which occurs when planets move from their initial orbits to larger, more distant orbits. We examine the mechanisms that drive planetary migration, such as interactions with other planets and the protoplanetary disk. Through numerical simulations, we find that planetary migration is a common occurrence and can result in the formation of hot Jupiters and other massive planets in close proximity to their host stars. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the diversity of exoplanetary systems and the processes that shape their evolution.
959	This research paper focuses on the direct optimization of ranking measures, which are widely used in information retrieval and machine learning applications. The paper proposes a new optimization framework that directly optimizes ranking measures, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, without the need for surrogate loss functions. The proposed method is based on a novel gradient descent algorithm that updates the ranking model parameters in a way that directly improves the ranking measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets for information retrieval and machine learning tasks. These results suggest that the proposed method can provide a more effective and efficient approach to optimizing ranking measures in various applications.
88	This research paper presents a study on the constraints of dark energy from cosmic shear power spectra. The impact of intrinsic alignments on photometric redshift requirements is also analyzed. The study shows that the inclusion of intrinsic alignment contaminants in the analysis of cosmic shear data significantly affects the precision of the dark energy constraints. The results suggest that accurate photometric redshifts are essential for obtaining robust constraints on dark energy. This research contributes to the understanding of the nature of dark energy and emphasizes the importance of improving the accuracy of photometric redshift estimations in future cosmic shear surveys.
2743	Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (SHB?PT) is a theoretical framework that describes the interactions of heavy baryons with pions. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effective field theory of SHB?PT, which includes different orders of perturbative corrections. We show that SHB?PT can accurately reproduce the experimental data for various observables, such as the mass of the ?b baryon and the decay rates of the ?b and ?b baryons. Our results demonstrate the power and versatility of SHB?PT as a tool for studying the strong interactions of heavy baryons with light mesons.
1988	This research paper aims to investigate whether individuals perceive themselves as typical or atypical in comparison to others. A sample of 300 participants completed a survey measuring their self-perception of typicality across various domains such as personality, appearance, and behavior. Results revealed that the majority of participants perceived themselves as typical in most domains, with the exception of personality traits. Furthermore, individuals who perceived themselves as atypical reported lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of social anxiety. The findings suggest that individuals' self-perception of typicality plays a crucial role in their psychological well-being. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.
1737	Axial resonances in the open and hidden charm sectors have been a topic of interest in recent years due to their potential to provide insight into the underlying quark-gluon dynamics of the strong force. In this research paper, we investigate the properties of these resonances using lattice QCD simulations. We focus on the meson-meson scattering amplitudes in the S-wave and P-wave channels, as well as the decay widths of the resonances into various final states. Our results show the existence of several axial resonances with masses and widths consistent with experimental observations. We also discuss the implications of our findings for future experimental searches and for the understanding of the nature of confinement in QCD.
2944	The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen, ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed. Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals, reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
2021	Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and second row of the periodic table is obtained.
806	This research paper investigates the confinement properties of an ensemble of dyons. Dyons are magnetic monopoles that carry both electric and magnetic charges, and their confinement is an important topic in theoretical physics. The main theme of this paper is to study how the dyons interact with each other and how they are confined within a system. Noteworthy results include the identification of a new confinement mechanism, which was found to be related to the presence of a topological charge. Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of these findings for our understanding of confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories. Overall, the paper contributes new insights into the behavior of dyons and their confinement, which have important implications for theoretical physics.
2392	We calculate the very high energy (sub-GeV to TeV) inverse Compton emission of GRB afterglows. We argue that this emission provides a powerful test of the currently accepted afterglow model. We focus on two processes: synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission within the afterglow blast wave, and external inverse Compton (EIC) emission which occurs when flare photons (produced by an internal process) pass through the blast wave. We show that if our current interpretations of the Swift XRT data are correct, there should be a canonical high energy afterglow emission light curve. Our predictions can be tested with high energy observatories such as GLAST, Whipple, H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. Under favorable conditions we expect afterglow detections in all these detectors.
207	In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.
1149	The research paper presents a summary of the properties of b-hadrons as of the end of 2006, including their masses, lifetimes, and decay modes. The results were obtained from various experiments conducted at different particle accelerators. The analysis of the data showed consistency with the Standard Model predictions and also provided constraints on its parameters. The paper concludes that the measurements of b-hadron properties have reached a high level of precision, which will be crucial in testing the predictions of the Standard Model and searching for new physics beyond it.
2536	"The research paper titled ""Non-minimal Wu-Yang Wormhole"" focuses on the theoretical concept of wormholes in space-time and proposes a new approach to studying these phenomena. The study builds upon the Wu-Yang wormhole, a type of wormhole that has been previously studied, but with a non-minimal approach. The main finding of the study is that the non-minimal Wu-Yang wormhole is stable and can exist in the universe. This is an important discovery as it expands our understanding of the potential existence and stability of wormholes, which could have profound implications for future space travel and exploration. Overall, the study highlights the importance of theoretical exploration in expanding our knowledge of the universe and the potential for new discoveries in the future."
D2-55	In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.
977	This research paper investigates the temperature and frequency dependent impedance of an electroceramic functional oxide thermistor. The study aims to understand the behavior of the thermistor under various conditions, which will aid in its application in temperature sensing and control systems. The results show that the impedance of the thermistor is highly dependent on both temperature and frequency. The thermistor exhibited a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, which is desirable for temperature sensing applications. The study also highlights the importance of considering frequency effects when designing thermistor-based circuits. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the behavior of electroceramic functional oxide thermistors and their potential use in various temperature sensing and control applications.
3969	The human brain is an incredibly complex and dynamic system that is capable of adapting to a wide range of environmental and physiological challenges. One of the key features of this adaptability is the ability of cortical networks to maintain their functionality in the face of damage or injury. In this research paper, we explore the use of simulation techniques to investigate the robustness of cortical networks against a variety of lesion types. Using a combination of computational models and empirical data, we present a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that allow cortical networks to maintain their functionality in the presence of lesions. Our findings provide important insights into the underlying principles of cortical network resilience, and have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for individuals with neurological disorders or injuries.
1971	The Standard Model of particle physics has been successfully used to predict and explain a wide range of phenomena, but some aspects of it remain untested. This research paper explores the potential for precision measurements of the weak charges of quarks to test the Standard Model. The authors describe the theoretical framework and experimental techniques involved in such measurements, and present results from previous experiments that provide evidence for the Standard Model's predictions. The paper concludes that further precision measurements of weak charges could provide valuable insights into the nature of the Standard Model and help uncover new physics beyond it.
D1-16	General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is a geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It provides a unified description of gravity as a property of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional continuum combining space and time. The theory posits that massive objects cause a curvature in spacetime, and this curvature influences the motion of objects, effectively manifesting as gravity. Einstein developed general relativity to address limitations in Newton's law of universal gravitation, particularly in explaining anomalies like the precession of Mercury's orbit. The theory has been extensively tested and confirmed through observations of gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects, and the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields
89	A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes, emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes, and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial differential equations.
3530	In several self-coupled quantum field theories when treated in semi-classical limit one obtains solitonic solutions determined by topology of the boundary conditions. Such solutions, e.g. magnetic monopole in unified theories \cite{Hooft1974} \cite{Polyakov1974} or the skyrme model of hadrons have been proposed as possible non-perturbative bound states which remain stable due to topological quantum numbers. Furthermore when fermions are introduced, under certain conditions one obtains zero-energy solutions \cite{Vega1978}\cite{Jackiw1981} for the Dirac equations localised on the soliton. An implication of such zero-modes is induced fermion number \cite{Jackiw1977} carried by the soliton.
1328	Many index theorems (both classical and in noncommutative geometry) can be interpreted in terms of a Lie groupoid acting properly on a manifold and leaving an elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators invariant. Alain Connes in his book raised the question of an index theorem in this general context. In this paper, an analytic index for many such situations is constructed. The approach is inspired by the classical families theorem of Atiyah and Singer, and the proof generalizes, to the case of proper Lie groupoid actions, some of the results proved for proper locally compact group actions by N. C. Phillips.
773	We report on far infrared measurements of interplane conductivity for underdoped single-crystal YBa2Cu3Oy in magnetic field and situate these new data within earlier work on two other high-Tc cuprate superconductors, La(2-x)SrxCuO4 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d). The three systems have displayed apparently disparate electrodynamic responses in the Josephson vortex state formed when magnetic field H is applied parallel to the CuO2 planes. Specifically, there is discrepancy in the number and field dependence of longitudinal modes observed. We compare and contrast these findings with several models of the electrodynamics in the vortex state and suggest that most differences can be reconciled through considerations of the Josephson vortex lattice ground state as well as the c-axis and in-plane quasiparticle dissipations.
690	This research paper presents a thorough characterisation of a three-dimensional Brownian motor in optical lattices. The Brownian motor is a microscopic system that converts thermal fluctuations into directed motion, making it a promising candidate for nanoscale engineering and transportation applications. The optical lattices provide a periodic potential landscape that serves as a trap for the Brownian motor, allowing it to move in a controlled manner. The characterisation of the Brownian motor is performed using a combination of theoretical modelling and experimental measurements, including the evaluation of the motor's efficiency and the analysis of its dynamics. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of Brownian motors in complex environments, which can be used to improve their design and optimise their performance for various applications.
546	This research paper presents matrix exponential-based closures for the turbulent subgrid-scale (SGS) stress tensor. The approach is based on the use of matrix exponential functions to approximate the evolution of SGS tensors in order to predict their behavior in turbulent flows. The proposed method is tested using numerical simulations of turbulent flows, and the results show that the matrix exponential-based closures provide accurate predictions of the SGS stress tensor. Additionally, the approach is shown to be computationally efficient and can be easily implemented in existing turbulence models. This research contributes to the development of improved turbulence models for a wide range of applications, including engineering and environmental fluid dynamics.
1941	Yes, there is. - A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of an U(1) symmetry, this kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, where it leads to the Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal nonlinear extension of quantum theory. The probabilistic interpretation, i.e. Born's rule, holds provided the underlying model has only dimensionless parameters.
718	This research paper explores the electronic properties of eumelanin monomers and dimers through theoretical modeling and spectroscopy techniques. The study finds that eumelanin exhibits unique electronic properties, including a large excited-state dipole moment and the ability to efficiently absorb and dissipate energy. Additionally, the research reveals that eumelanin dimers have a stronger electronic coupling than monomers, leading to enhanced energy transfer and potentially important implications for the material's functionality. Overall, this research sheds light on the fundamental electronic properties of eumelanin and its potential applications in fields such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.
3870	In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.
330	This research paper aims to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms in object-oriented database systems. The study compares four clustering algorithms, namely, k-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and hierarchical clustering, based on their clustering quality and runtime efficiency. The experiments were conducted using synthetic and real-world datasets, and the results show that the performance of clustering algorithms varies depending on the dataset characteristics. Based on the findings, this paper provides insights and recommendations for selecting appropriate clustering algorithms for object-oriented database systems to optimize clustering quality and runtime efficiency.
3360	This research paper explores the concept of inflated beta distributions, which are probability distributions that have an excess of observations at either end of the distribution. The main focus of the study is to provide a comprehensive overview of inflated beta distributions and their properties, including moments, skewness, and kurtosis. The paper also examines the application of inflated beta distributions in modeling empirical data, such as financial returns and the likelihood of extreme events. The crucial finding of this study is that inflated beta distributions are useful for modeling data with heavy tails and provide a better fit than traditional beta distributions. The conclusion of the paper is that inflated beta distributions offer a flexible and powerful tool for modeling complex data and should be considered by researchers and practitioners in various fields.
3600	We define the alternating sign matrix polytope as the convex hull of nxn alternating sign matrices and prove its equivalent description in terms of inequalities. This is analogous to the well known result of Birkhoff and von Neumann that the convex hull of the permutation matrices equals the set of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices. We count the facets and vertices of the alternating sign matrix polytope and describe its projection to the permutohedron as well as give a complete characterization of its face lattice in terms of modified square ice configurations. Furthermore we prove that the dimension of any face can be easily determined from this characterization.
4031	We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.
1546	A spherically symmetrical ultra-relativistic blast wave is not an attractor of a generic asymmetric explosion. Spherical symmetry is reached only by the time the blast wave slows down to non-relativistic velocities, when the Sedov-Taylor-von Neumann attractor solution sets in. We show however, that a directed relativistic explosion, with the explosion momentum close to the explosion energy, produces a blast wave with a universal intermediate asymptotic -- a selfsimilar directed ultra-relativistic blast wave. This universality might be of interest for the astrophysics of gamma-ray burst afterglows.
1200	We show that the category of projective modules over a graded commutative ring admits a triangulation with respect to module suspension if and only if the ring is a finite product of graded fields and exterior algebras on one generator over a graded field (with a unit in the appropriate degree). We also classify the ungraded commutative rings for which the category of projective modules admits a triangulation with respect to the identity suspension. Applications to two analogues of the generating hypothesis in algebraic topology are given, and we translate our results into the setting of modules over a symmetric ring spectrum or S-algebra.
1884	In this paper, we report on the magnetic properties of Ba2CoS3, a spin-chain compound recently found to be the first Co2+ containing one-dimensional sulphide to show metallic-like conductivity and negative magnetoresistance. We carried out an in-depth experimental investigation of the local structure of the cobalt atoms, and ab-initio calculations of the resulting electronic configuration of Co2+. From theoretical considerations, the intra-chain coupling was predicted to be antiferromagnetic. Experimentally, several estimates of this magnetic coupling were derived by analysing the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements also provided evidence of a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering, a feature indicative of a noticeable inter-chain coupling in this quasi-1D system.
D2-27	In 1802, Lamarck published Hydrogéologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe. That year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life.
3260	We study the effects of a high-frequency (HF) signal on the response of a noisy bistable system to a low-frequency subthreshold sinusoidal signal. We show that, by conveniently choosing the ratio of the amplitude of the HF signal to its frequency, stochastic resonance gains greater than unity can be measured at the low-frequency value. Thus, the addition of the HF signal can entail an improvement in the detection of weak monochromatic signals. The results are explained in terms of an effective model and illustrated by means of numerical simulations.
594	This Letter reports on the detection of two super-Earth planets in the Gl581 system, already known to harbour a hot Neptune. One of the planets has a mass of 5 M_Earth and resides at the ``warm'' edge of the habitable zone of the star. It is thus the known exoplanet which most resembles our own Earth. The other planet has a 7.7 M_Earth mass and orbits at 0.25 AU from the star, close to the ``cold'' edge of the habitable zone. These two new light planets around an M3 dwarf further confirm the formerly tentative statistical trend for i) many more very low-mass planets being found around M dwarfs than around solar-type stars and ii) low-mass planets outnumbering Jovian planets around M dwarfs.
3855	"The research paper titled ""Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC"" focuses on the search for particles called sbottoms at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. The paper discusses the challenges in identifying these particles due to their complex decay patterns and the need for advanced analysis techniques. The study proposes a novel method for detecting sbottoms by examining their spin properties. The authors conclude that this approach could significantly improve the sensitivity of sbottom searches and provide new insights into the nature of particle physics. Overall, the research highlights the importance of continued exploration and development of advanced techniques in particle physics research."
2858	This research paper proposes an effective conservation of energy and momentum algorithm using switching potentials for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamical systems. The algorithm is designed to address the challenges of accurately simulating complex systems with large numbers of particles while maintaining energy and momentum conservation. The switching potentials method allows for the accurate calculation of forces between particles, ensuring that energy and momentum are conserved throughout the simulation. The proposed algorithm is tested on various thermodynamical systems and is found to be effective in maintaining energy and momentum conservation while accurately simulating the behavior of the systems. This algorithm has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers in the field of molecular dynamics simulation.
588	Colouring sparse graphs under various restrictions is a theoretical problem of significant practical relevance. Here we consider the problem of maximizing the number of different colours available at the nodes and their neighbourhoods, given a predetermined number of colours. In the analytical framework of a tree approximation, carried out at both zero and finite temperatures, solutions obtained by population dynamics give rise to estimates of the threshold connectivity for the incomplete to complete transition, which are consistent with those of existing algorithms. The nature of the transition as well as the validity of the tree approximation are investigated.
1292	This research paper examines the intermediate regime in the Tetrathiafulvalene-Chloranil (TTF-CA) pressure-induced neutral-ionic transition. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis, we investigate the behavior of TTF-CA under varying pressure conditions. Our findings reveal the existence of an intermediate regime where the system exhibits unique properties that differ from both the neutral and ionic states. We also identify critical pressure points that trigger the transition from the intermediate regime to the ionic state. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of TTF-CA and may have implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic and optical properties.
1030	This paper proposes an approach to training rough set models using Bayesian framework trained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The prior probabilities are constructed from the prior knowledge that good rough set models have fewer rules. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is conducted through sampling in the rough set granule space and Metropolis algorithm is used as an acceptance criteria. The proposed method is tested to estimate the risk of HIV given demographic data. The results obtained shows that the proposed approach is able to achieve an average accuracy of 58% with the accuracy varying up to 66%. In addition the Bayesian rough set give the probabilities of the estimated HIV status as well as the linguistic rules describing how the demographic parameters drive the risk of HIV.
973	This research paper explores the use of geometry and topology in the study of relativistic cosmology. The primary theme is to investigate the mathematical structures that underpin the current understanding of the universe and how they relate to observations. The paper reviews the fundamental concepts of general relativity and cosmology, including the Friedmann equations and the cosmic microwave background radiation. It then discusses the role of geometry and topology in interpreting these concepts, with a particular focus on the spatial curvature of the universe and the topology of cosmic structures. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this field and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe.
1942	We introduce and study the notion of a dual Feynman transform of a modular operad. This generalizes and gives a conceptual explanation of Kontsevich's dual construction producing graph cohomology classes from a contractible differential graded Frobenius algebra. The dual Feynman transform of a modular operad is indeed linear dual to the Feynman transform introduced by Getzler and Kapranov when evaluated on vacuum graphs. In marked contrast to the Feynman transform, the dual notion admits an extremely simple presentation via generators and relations; this leads to an explicit and easy description of its algebras. We discuss a further generalization of the dual Feynman transform whose algebras are not necessarily contractible. This naturally gives rise to a two-colored graph complex analogous to the Boardman-Vogt topological tree complex.
1141	This research paper explores the manipulation of the density of photonic states to control the balance between spontaneous emission and Forster energy transfer in biological systems. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, the authors demonstrate that by altering the density of photonic states in a medium, it is possible to tune the efficiency of energy transfer between donor and acceptor molecules. The results suggest that this approach could be used to optimize the performance of biological systems, particularly in the context of energy harvesting and sensing applications. Overall, this research highlights the potential of photonic engineering as a powerful tool for controlling and manipulating biological processes at the nanoscale.
3744	"The research paper titled ""Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts"" investigates the behavior of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs) in a two-dimensional electron gas. The main theme of the paper is the study of counterflow, where electrons are injected from opposite sides of the QPCs and flow in opposite directions. The authors report that when the QPCs are close together, the counterflow of electrons is suppressed due to the Coulomb interaction between them. However, when the QPCs are separated by a distance larger than the electron wavelength, the counterflow becomes dominant. The paper concludes that the behavior of electrons in QPCs is highly dependent on their distance and Coulomb interaction, and these findings could have implications for the development of new electronic devices."
3139	The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps. Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one consider maps that are ergodic.
2480	"The research paper titled ""Aspects of Stochastic Resonance in Reaction-Diffusion Systems: The Nonequilibrium-Potential Approach"" investigates the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems. The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the nonequilibrium-potential approach, which allows for the examination of the role of noise in the system's behavior. They demonstrate that the presence of noise can enhance the system's response to external signals, leading to stochastic resonance. The study also explores the effects of different parameters, such as the system's size and the strength of the noise, on the occurrence and strength of stochastic resonance. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of how noise influences the behavior of complex systems and have implications for fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology."
2366	The application of Superheated Droplet Detectors (SDDs) to dark matter searches has so far been confined to the light nuclei refrigerants C2ClF5 and C4F10 (SIMPLE and PICASSO, respectively), with a principle sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions. Given the competitive results of these devices, as a result of their intrinsic insensitivity to backgrounds, we have developed a prototype trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I)-loaded SDD with increased sensitivity to spin-independent interactions as well. A low (0.102 kgd) exposure test operation of two high concentration, 1 liter devices is described, and the results compared with leading experiments in both spin-dependent and -independent sectors. Although competitive in both sectors when the difference in exposures is accounted for, a problem with fracturing of the detector gel must be addressed before significantly larger exposures can be envisioned.
1001	This paper explores the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in selective-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The authors propose a selective-fading MIMO channel model and derive the DMT for this model using an outage probability analysis. They also compare the performance of different MIMO schemes, including space-time codes and beamforming, in terms of their achievable DMT. The findings suggest that beamforming can achieve higher multiplexing gains than space-time codes, but at the cost of reduced diversity gains. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering the DMT when designing MIMO systems for selective-fading channels.
1793	This research paper aims to discuss the current status and future of asymmetry measurement in neutron beta decay. The paper provides an overview of the theoretical background of neutron beta decay and the importance of asymmetry measurements in understanding the properties of the weak interaction. The paper also reviews the existing experimental techniques for asymmetry measurement, including the use of polarized neutron beams and neutron detectors. In addition, the paper explores the potential future developments in asymmetry measurement, such as the use of improved experimental setups and the development of new technologies. The paper concludes with a discussion of the significance of asymmetry measurement in advancing our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe.
3001	The critical adsorption point (CAP) of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interacting with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed by Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), that describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer adsorption.
2973	This research paper investigates the long-range correlation and multifractality of pitch series in Bach's Inventions. Through the use of multifractal analysis, we explore the complex and self-similar patterns within the musical structures of Bach's compositions. Our findings suggest that the pitch sequences in Bach's Inventions exhibit multifractal behavior, indicating a high degree of complexity and variability in the music. Additionally, we observe long-range correlations within the pitch series, revealing a persistent structure that extends throughout the entire composition. These results provide insight into the intricate and sophisticated musical structures of Bach's works and may have implications for understanding the underlying principles of music composition.
3722	This research paper presents a novel geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C). The Lie algebra sl(6,C) is an important object in mathematics and has applications in areas such as physics and representation theory. In this paper, we construct a geometric object using the Grassmannian manifold and show that it has the same Lie algebra structure as sl(6,C). We provide explicit calculations to demonstrate this result and discuss the implications of our construction. This geometric realization of sl(6,C) provides a new perspective on the structure of this Lie algebra and may lead to new insights in related fields.
681	The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument onboard GLAST offers a tremendous opportunity for future blazar studies. In order to fully benefit from its capabilities and to maximize the scientific return from the LAT, it is of great importance to conduct dedicated multi-frequency monitoring campaigns that will result comprehensive observations. Consequently, we initiated an effort to conduct a GLAST-dedicated, quasi-simultaneous, broad-band flux-density (and polarization) monitoring of potential GLAST blazars with the Effelsberg and OVRO radio telescopes (11cm to 7mm wavelength). Here, we present a short overview of these activities which will complement the multi-wavelengths activities of the GLAST/LAT collaboration towards the 'low-energy' radio bands. Further we will give a brief outlook including the extension of this coordinated campaign towards higher frequencies and future scientific aims.
1562	This research paper examines the brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085 and reports on a surprising reversal of temperatures between the two components. The study utilized high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry to measure the temperatures and other physical properties of the binary system. The results show that the smaller, less massive component is hotter than the larger, more massive component, which is contrary to the expected temperature difference in such binaries. This discovery challenges current models of brown-dwarf formation and evolution and can have significant implications for our understanding of these objects.
629	This research paper investigates the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks under quality-of-service constraints. The proposed approach aims to minimize the energy consumption of network nodes while ensuring the satisfaction of QoS requirements for all users. The paper presents a joint optimization model for allocating power and bandwidth resources, taking into account the channel conditions, traffic characteristics, and QoS parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which show significant energy savings compared to other existing methods, while maintaining high QoS levels. The results of this study can be useful for designing energy-efficient wireless networks that can support diverse applications with different QoS requirements.
2968	Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic junctions.
1331	"The research paper titled ""Cascading Behavior in Large Blog Graphs"" explores the phenomenon of cascading behavior in online social networks, specifically in large blog graphs. The authors investigate the factors that contribute to the spread of information and ideas within these networks and the resulting impact on online communities. Through their analysis, the authors conclude that the structure of the network and the behavior of its members play important roles in the propagation of information. They also identify certain individuals, known as ""hubs,"" who have a disproportionate influence on the spread of information. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the dynamics of online communities and the potential for information to rapidly spread through social networks."
1243	GREGOR is a new open solar telescope with an aperture of 1.5m. It replaces the former 45-cm Gregory Coude telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The optical concept is that of a double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical mirrors are made from a silicon-carbide material with high thermal conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the near infrared and a 2-dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Perot interferometers for the visible.
1018	"A class of interacting classical random fields is constructed using deformed *-algebras of creation and annihilation operators. The fields constructed are classical random field versions of ""Lie fields"". A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the fields constructed are ""quantum random fields"" in the sense that they have Poincare invariant vacua with a fluctuation scale determined by Planck's constant. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle interpretation of a quantum field theory."
1201	Abstract:Triangulations of projective modules have been a subject of interest in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of triangulations of projective modules over a commutative ring. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of triangulations, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a projective module to admit a triangulation. We also explore the relationship between triangulations of projective modules and tilting modules, and give examples of how triangulations can be used to study representation theory. Finally, we discuss applications of triangulations in algebraic geometry, including the construction of moduli spaces and the study of the derived category of coherent sheaves. Our results have implications for a wide range of topics in mathematics, including algebraic topology, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry.
873	"The research paper titled ""Quantum Hacking: Experimental demonstration of time-shift attack against practical quantum key distribution systems"" explores the vulnerability of quantum key distribution systems to time-shift attacks. The paper presents experimental results that show how an attacker can exploit timing errors to gain unauthorized access to quantum keys. The study reveals that practical quantum key distribution systems are susceptible to time-shift attacks, and the security of these systems must be improved to prevent such attacks. The paper concludes that quantum cryptography protocols must be designed with robust timing mechanisms to prevent time-shift attacks and ensure the security of quantum keys."
791	The E_6/U(1)_N gauge extension of the Supersymmetric Standard Model, first proposed by Ma, is shown to have exactly the requisite ingredients to realize the important new idea that dark matter is the origin of neutrino mass. With the implementation of a discrete Z_2 X Z_2 symmetry, and particle content given by three {27} representations of E_6, neutrino masses are naturally generated in two loops, with candidates of dark matter in the loops. All particles of this model are expected to be at or below the TeV scale, allowing them to be observable at the LHC.
1639	This research paper investigates the application of maximum entropy methods to infer the physical parameters of core-collapse supernovae from gravitational wave data. The main focus is on the improvement of the accuracy of parameter estimation by incorporating prior information and using the maximum entropy principle. The authors present a novel approach for data analysis that allows for the identification of the waveforms associated with specific physical processes, which could lead to more accurate predictions of astrophysical events. The crucial findings of this study highlight the effectiveness of maximum entropy methods for gravitational wave data analysis and the potential for improving our understanding of core-collapse supernovae.
3030	This research paper investigates the scalar self-force on eccentric geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime using a time-domain computation. The self-force is computed using the mode-sum regularization method and is shown to be dependent on the eccentricity of the geodesic. Results indicate that the scalar self-force can significantly alter the trajectory of the geodesic, leading to precession and changes in the orbital period. The study provides insight into the behavior of self-forces in curved spacetimes and has implications for the understanding of gravitational dynamics in extreme environments.
1195	The research paper investigates the phenomenon of peak effect in polydisperse particle systems, which refers to the peak in the critical current density as a function of magnetic field. The authors study the disordering transitions that occur in such systems, which can lead to the formation of vortices and affect the peak effect. Using simulations and experiments, the authors explore the effects of particle size distribution, interparticle interactions, and other factors on the disordering transitions and peak effect. They find that the peak effect is determined by a delicate balance between disordering and ordering effects, and that polydispersity can enhance or suppress the peak effect depending on the specific system. The results of the study have implications for the design and optimization of superconducting materials and other particle systems with disordering transitions.
1488	A two-staged, uniaxial magnetoresistive effect has been discovered in SrCo6O11 having a layered hexagonal structure. Conduction electrons and localized Ising spins are in different sublattices but their interpenetration makes the conduction electrons sensitively pick up the stepwise field-dependence of magnetization. The stepwise field-dependence suggests two competitive interlayer interactions between ferromagnetic Ising-spin layers, i.e., a ferromagnetic nearest-layer interaction and an antiferromagnetic next-nearest-layer interaction. This oxide offers a unique opportunity to study nontrivial interplay between conduction electrons and Ising spins, the coupling of which can be finely controlled by a magnetic field of a few Tesla.
1291	We report a detailed spectroscopic study of the pressure induced neutral-ionic phase transition (NIT) of the mixed-stack charge-transfer (CT) crystal tetrathiafulvalene-chloranil (TTF-CA). We show that the pressure induced phase transition is still first-order and involves the presence of an intermediate disordered phase, defined by the coexistence of two species of different ionicity. Further application of pressure gradually converts this phase into an homogeneous ferroelectric phase with a single ionicity. In addition, we detect strong pretransitional phenomena which anticipate the intermediate phase and are indicative of a precursor dynamic regime dominated by fluctuations.
3619	This research paper investigates the formation of residual nuclides in different target materials induced by proton beams with energies ranging from 0.04 to 2.6 GeV. Specifically, the study examines the production of residual nuclides in 206,207,208,nat-Pb and 209-Bi, as well as in 56-Fe. The experimental results reveal that the production cross-sections of residual nuclides are strongly dependent on the target material, proton energy, and incident angle. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of nuclear reactions induced by proton beams, and the findings may have implications for the design of future nuclear facilities and radiation shielding.
1361	We report on the realization of a multi-orbital system with ultracold atoms in the excited bands of a 3D optical lattice by selectively controlling the band population along a given lattice direction. The lifetime of the atoms in the excited band is found to be considerably longer (10-100 times) than the characteristic time scale for inter-site tunneling, thus opening the path for orbital selective many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Upon exciting the atoms from an initial lowest band Mott insulating state to higher lying bands, we observe the dynamical emergence of coherence in 1D (and 2D), compatible with Bose-Einstein condensation to a non-zero momentum state.
3604	Results from a phenomenological analysis for diffractive hadroproduction of heavy flavors at high energies are reported. Diffractive production of charm, bottom and top are calculated using Regge factorization, taking into account recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton density functions in Pomeron by the H1 Collaboration at DESY-HERA. In addition, multiple-Pomeron corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability factor. We give numerical predictions for single diffractive as well as double Pomeron exchange (DPE) cross sections, which agree with the available data for diffractive production of charm and beauty. We make estimates which could be compared to future measurements at the LHC.
D2-39	Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s
3371	We consider a diffusion model with limit cycle reaction functions, in the presence of convection. We select a set of functions derived from a realistic reaction model: the Schnakenberg equations. This resultant form is unsymmetrical. We find a transformation which maps the irregular equations into model form. Next we transform the dependent variables into polar form. From here, a travelling wave analysis is performed on the radial variable. Results are complex, but we make some simple estimates. We carry out numerical experiments to test our analysis. An initial `knock' starts the propagation of pattern. The speed of the travelling wave is not quite as expected. We investigate further. The system demonstrates distinctly different behaviour to the left and the right. We explain how this phenomenon occurs by examining the underlying behaviour.
2900	This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy element production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439. However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance. In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element observations.
D1-12	Biological evolution, according to Charles Darwin, refers to the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down from one generation to the next. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that individuals within a species show variation in their characteristics. These variations can affect their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Those individuals with traits that give them a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring, while less advantageous traits are gradually eliminated. Over long periods, this process leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in the population, resulting in the adaptation of species to their environment.
922	This research paper investigates the application of quantum mechanics to Hilbert manifolds and explores the principle of functional relativity. The main objective is to develop a mathematical framework for describing quantum systems on infinite-dimensional manifolds and to demonstrate that the principle of functional relativity holds in this context. Key results include the derivation of a Schr dinger-like equation on a Hilbert manifold and the demonstration that the principle of functional relativity holds for both classical and quantum systems. The paper concludes that the principle of functional relativity is a fundamental property of physical systems and should be considered in the development of future quantum theories.
2566	We argue that claims about magnetic field dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth lambda, which were made on the basis of moun-spin-rotation studies of some superconductors, originate from insufficient accuracy of theoretical models employed for the data analysis. We also reanalyze some of already published experimental data and demonstrate that numerical calculations of Brandt [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 68, 54506 (2003)] may serve as a reliable and powerful tool for the analysis of the data collected in experiments with conventional superconductors. Furthermore, one can use this approach in order to distinguish between conventional and unconventional superconductors. It is unfortunate that these calculations have practically never been employed for such analyses.
38	This research paper provides an overview of recent surveys of the Galactic Center and their implications for understanding the nature of the Galactic Center lobe. The paper highlights key discoveries related to the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the lobe, and discusses their relevance for models of the Milky Way's central region. The authors conclude that the lobe is likely a result of past accretion events and feedback from the central black hole, and suggest that future observations will help to refine our understanding of its properties and evolution.
749	Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD, such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent. While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust for hundreds of qubits.
3775	We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.
2374	The Large Hadron Collider, a 7 + 7 TeV proton-proton collider under construction at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva), will take experiments squarely into a new energy domain where mysteries of the electroweak interaction will be unveiled. What marks the 1-TeV scale as an important target? Why is understanding how the electroweak symmetry is hidden important to our conception of the world around us? What expectations do we have for the agent that hides the electroweak symmetry? Why do particle physicists anticipate a great harvest of discoveries within reach of the LHC?
1417	We analyze the scaling parameter, extracted from the fidelity for two different ground states, for the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse field near the critical point. It is found that, in the thermodynamic limit, the scaling parameter is singular, and the derivative of its logarithmic function with respect to the transverse field strength is logarithmically divergent at the critical point. The scaling behavior is confirmed numerically by performing a finite size scaling analysis for systems of different sizes, consistent with the conformal invariance at the critical point. This allows us to extract the correlation length critical exponent, which turns out to be universal in the sense that the correlation length critical exponent does not depend on either the anisotropic parameter or the transverse field strength.
617	The article focuses on the effects of an oscillating magnetic field on pattern formation in a ferromagnetic thin film. The study analyzes patterns that travel at a low velocity and examines the conditions under which they form. The authors use numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of the magnetic field and the formation of patterns in the ferromagnetic thin film. The results show that the oscillating field can induce pattern formation and that the patterns formed are affected by the strength and frequency of the oscillation. The authors conclude that their findings offer insight into the fundamental mechanisms of pattern formation in ferromagnetic materials and could have potential applications in the development of magnetic devices.
3043	The Schrodinger motion of a charged quantum particle in an electromagnetic potential can be simulated by the paraxial dynamics of photons propagating through a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity induces geometric effects that generate an artificial vector potential to which signal photons are coupled. This phenomenon can be implemented with slow light propagating through an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-induced transparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to a reduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift of Aharonov-Bohm type.
3628	An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the data, and hence, saves time.
3957	This research paper investigates the effects of allene and propyne doping on rich methane premixed laminar flames. The study aims to understand the impact of these light unsaturated hydrocarbons on the flame structure and combustion characteristics. The experiments were conducted using a burner stabilized flame, and the results were analyzed using laser-based diagnostics. The findings indicate that both allene and propyne doping increase the flame speed and reduce the flame thickness, indicating enhanced combustion efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of allene and propyne leads to the formation of new intermediate species, which have significant implications for the overall combustion process. These results offer critical insights into the use of light unsaturated hydrocarbons as fuel additives to improve the efficiency and reduce emissions in combustion systems.
3605	This research paper focuses on the estimation of heavy flavour production in hadron-hadron colliders. The study aims to provide an understanding of the production mechanisms of single and double diffractive heavy flavours in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. The research is based on the theoretical framework of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Monte Carlo simulations. The paper presents the results of the estimation of the cross-sections and differential distributions for the production of charm and bottom quarks in single and double diffractive processes. The analysis includes a comparison of the results with experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. The study is expected to contribute to the overall understanding of heavy flavour production in hadron-hadron collisions and provide insights for future collider experiments.
1703	OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of remnant-cloud interaction. We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36 supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.
2127	"We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass."
1790	The aim of this article is to study a nonlinear system modeling a Non-Newtonian fluid of polymer aqueous solutions. We are interested here in the existence of weak solutions for the stationary problem in a bounded plane domain or in two-dimensional exterior domain. Due to the third order of derivatives in the non-linear term, it's difficult to obtain solution satisfying energy inequality. But with a good choice of boundary conditions, an adapt special basis and the use of the good properties of the trilinear form associated to the non-linear term, we obtain energy solutions. The problem in bounded domain is treated and the more difficult problem on non bounded domain too.
154	This research paper investigates the scalar wave equation in a non-commutative spherically symmetric space-time. The study examines the impact of non-commutativity on the propagation of scalar waves and the dynamics of physical systems. The critical outcomes of the research reveal that non-commutativity introduces new features in the wave equation and modifies the solutions in the spherically symmetric space-time. The findings suggest that non-commutativity has significant consequences for the interpretation of physical phenomena and the formulation of theories in quantum field theory and general relativity. The research provides a framework for future investigations into the effects of non-commutativity on various physical systems and highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the dynamics of non-commutative space-times.
2309	This research paper investigates the formation of Ramsey fringes during the excitation of topological modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main objective of this study is to understand the behavior of topological modes in a condensate and how they can be manipulated to create Ramsey fringes. The study finds that the formation of Ramsey fringes is highly sensitive to the excitation frequency and the strength of the external perturbation. Additionally, the study shows that the topological modes can be used as a useful tool for precision measurements and quantum information processing. The results of this study have important implications for the development of quantum technologies and the understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics.
3489	This research paper presents a new discrete computer network model with expanding dimensions. The model captures the growth of a network over time, allowing for the addition of new nodes and edges as the network expands. The model is based on a dynamic graph structure and includes a set of rules for adding new nodes and edges. We conduct experiments to validate the model and demonstrate its ability to capture the dynamics of real-world networks. We also derive a set of theoretical results, including the degree distribution and clustering coefficient, which can be used to analyze the properties of the network as it expands. Our results show that the model accurately captures the behavior of real-world networks, and provides a useful tool for studying the growth and evolution of complex systems.
2612	The use of microfluidic chips has become increasingly popular in various applications due to their small size and ability to manipulate fluids at the microscale level. In this study, we investigate the acoustic resonances that occur within microfluidic chips and their effects on fluid flow using full-image micro-PIV experiments and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that acoustic resonances can significantly alter the flow patterns in microfluidic chips, leading to the development of new flow structures and enhancing mixing efficiency. Furthermore, we show that numerical simulations can accurately predict the acoustic resonance frequencies and associated flow patterns. Overall, our findings provide insights into the fundamental understanding of acoustic resonances in microfluidic chips and their potential applications in enhancing fluid manipulation and mixing.
236	This research paper explores the interplay between universities and industries through the FP5 network. The FP5 network, which was established by the European Union, aimed to promote collaboration and knowledge exchange between universities and industries. The study investigates the effectiveness of this network in fostering partnerships, developing joint projects, and enhancing technology transfer. The research employs a qualitative approach through a case study analysis of selected academic and industry collaborations within the FP5 network. The findings of this study provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of university-industry collaboration and shed light on the potential of the FP5 network to facilitate such collaborations.
687	"Efficient injection of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band of silicon is limited by the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal (FM)/silicon interface. In the present work, this ""magnetically-dead"" silicide (where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization) is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junction base anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. This results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency, from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimated spin polarization in Si from ~1% to at least ~15%. The injector tunnel-junction bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization."
1756	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons with a positively defined metric in internal space in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are also emphasized.
93	The radiation hardness of silicon charged particle sensors is compared with single crystal and polycrystalline diamond sensors, both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis, which states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and neutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the inelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross section prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the light nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of magnitude more radiation hard than silicon, while at energies below 0.1 GeV the difference becomes significantly smaller.
3516	Through polarization observations masers are unique probes of the magnetic field in a variety of different astronomical objects, with the different maser species tracing different physical conditions. In recent years maser polarization observations have provided insights in the magnetic field strength and morphology in, among others, the envelopes around evolved stars, Planetary Nebulae (PNe), massive star forming regions and supernova remnants. More recently, maser observations have even been used to determine the magnetic field in megamaser galaxies. This review will present an overview of maser polarization observations and magnetic field determinations of the last several years and discuss the implications of the magnetic field measurements for several important fields of study, such as aspherical PNe creation and massive star formation.
1429	"We discuss in this paper two ways of defining the concept of ""effective field theory"": effective field theory defined by low energy effectiveness and effective field theory defined by 4D effectiveness out of higher dimensions. We argue that these two views are actually equivalent, that effective field theories at low energy can in fact be regarded as field theories of higher dimensions confined on a 4D spcaetime. We examine this idea through comparing two different regularization schemes: Momentum Cutoff and Dimensional Regularization, and through analyzing how fields can be localized on branes."
2575	We report CCD photometry and spectroscopy during 2006 outburst of the dwarf nova SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 (SDSS J1021). The photographic plates from the MAO, SAI and CrAO plate archives, which cover the position of the SDSS J1021, were inspected for the presence of previous outbursts. We also present the BVRcIc photometric calibration of 52 stars in SDSS J1021 vicinity, which have V-magnitude in the range of 11.21-17.23m and can serve as comparison stars. The large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this object as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova.
2217	This research paper focuses on the fairness provision in the IEEE 802.11e infrastructure basic service set (IBSS). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the fairness provision mechanism in ensuring fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The research was conducted through simulations using the Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) tool. The results showed that the fairness provision mechanism effectively ensures fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The study also found that the fairness provision mechanism is effective in reducing channel contention and increasing the overall throughput of the IBSS. The paper concludes that the fairness provision mechanism is a crucial component of the IEEE 802.11e standard and should be implemented in all IBSS networks to ensure fair channel access for all stations.
2234	Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and homodyne measurement.
3291	"We consider the formation of OB associations from two perspectives: (a) the fractional gas consumption in star formation,epsilon, per dynamical time scale t_dyn in a galaxy, and (b) the origin of the so-called Kennicutt-Schmidt law that the rate of star formation per unit area is proportional to a power, alpha, of the surface density in HI and H_2 gas when certain thresholds are crossed. The empirical findings that epsilon is approximately 0.01 and alpha is approximately 1.4 or 1.5 have simple explanations if the rate of star formation is magnetically regulated. An empirical test of the ideas resides in an analysis of why giant OB associations are ``strung out like pearls along the arms"" of spiral galaxies."
3973	"The research paper ""Modelling the Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiant-dominated Populations"" focuses on the study of red supergiant stars and their impact on the near-infrared spectra of their host galaxies. The authors developed a theoretical model that takes into account the contribution of red supergiants to the spectra of their host galaxies. They found that red supergiants play a significant role in shaping the near-infrared spectra of galaxies, and their contribution increases with increasing metallicity. The study concludes that red supergiants are important probes for understanding the properties of their host galaxies and can provide valuable insights into the star formation history and chemical evolution of these systems."
2080	This paper derives an explicit formula for Branson's Q-curvature in even-dimensional conformal geometry. The ingredients in the formula come from the Poincare metric in one higher dimension; hence the formula is called holographic. When specialized to the conformally flat case, the holographic formula expresses Q-curvature as a multiple of the Pfaffian and the divergence of a natural one-form. The paper also outlines the relation between holographic formulae for Q-curvature and a new theory of conformally covariant families of differential operators due to the second author.
1457	This research paper investigates the globally stable quasistatic evolution in plasticity with softening. The study focuses on the mathematical analysis of the plasticity model, which includes a softening term. The findings show that the quasistatic evolution of the model is globally stable, even in the presence of softening. This result is significant because it provides a better understanding of the behavior of materials undergoing plastic deformation and can inform the design of more resilient structures. The study also offers insights into the mathematical analysis of plasticity models and their evolution.
D2-68	The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms to produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost-effective manner. Current examples include producing beer, wine, cheese, pharmaceuticals, and other biotechnology products.[2] Another possible area of use is the development of oil crops whose composition has been modified to improve their nutritional value.[3] Some of the common strategies used for metabolic engineering are (1) overexpressing the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, (2) blocking the competing metabolic pathways, (3) heterologous gene expression, and (4) enzyme engineering. Since cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have drastic effects on the cells' viability.
83	We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic factors, such as country wealth and foreign investment per capita, which are characterized by a power law spanning multiple scales of wealth and investments per capita. These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable over different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between level of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for two independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption. The functional relations we report have implications when assessing the relative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for quantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign investments.
3145	This research paper explores the concept of charges from attractors and their impact on the behavior of particles in a system. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that charges from attractors can significantly affect the dynamics of particles, leading to the formation of complex patterns and structures. We also show that the strength and distribution of charges from attractors can be tuned to control the behavior of particles, offering potential applications in materials science and biophysics. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering charges from attractors in understanding and manipulating the behavior of complex systems.
2096	Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show variability. The design of an efficient field emitting device requires the analysis of the variabilities with a systematic and multiphysics based modeling approach. In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to study the performance at the device scale.
1198	"We introduce the idea of using adiabatic rotation to generate superpositions of a large class of quantum states. For quantum computing this is an interesting alternative to the well-studied ""straight line"" adiabatic evolution. In ways that complement recent results, we show how to efficiently prepare three types of states: Kitaev's toric code state, the cluster state of the measurement-based computation model and the history state used in the adiabatic simulation of quantum circuit. We also show that the method, when adapted for quantum search, provides quadratic speedup as other optimal methods do with the advantages that the problem Hamiltonian is time-independent and that the energy gap above the ground state is strictly nondecreasing with time. Likewise the method can be used for optimization as an alternative to the usual adiabatic algorithm."
2254	The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.
2143	"Using the previously derived confining gluon propagator, the corresponding system of equations determining the quark propagator is derived. The system of equations consists of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator itself, which includes the zero momentum transfer quark-gluon vertex. It is complemented by the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this vertex. The quark equation depends explicitly on the mass gap, determining the scale of the truly nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state. The obtained system of equations is manifestly gauge-invariant, i.e., does not depend explicitly on the gauge-fixing parameter. It is also free from all the types of the perturbative contributions (""contaminations""), which may appear at the fundamental quark-gluon level."
1928	The main goal of this project is to research technical advances in order to enhance the possibility to develop narratives within immersive mediated environments. An important part of the research is concerned with the question of how a script can be written, annotated and realized for an immersive context. A first description of the main theoretical framework and the ongoing work and a first script example is provided. This project is part of the program for presence research, and it will exploit physiological feedback and Computational Intelligence within virtual reality.
3047	This research paper investigates the coupling of whispering-gallery modes in size-mismatched microdisk photonic molecules. By utilizing numerical simulations and experimental measurements, we demonstrate the existence of mode coupling and identify the conditions under which it occurs. Our results reveal that the coupling strength is influenced by the size and separation distance of the microdisks. Furthermore, we observe that the coupling can lead to the creation of new modes and spectral splitting. These findings provide insights into the design and optimization of photonic devices based on microdisk photonic molecules.
643	We study motion of small particles in turbulence when the particle relaxation time falls in the range of inertial time-scales of the flow. Due to inertia, particles drift relative to the fluid. We show that the drift velocity is close to the Lagrangian velocity increments of turbulence at the particle relaxation time. We demonstrate that the collective drift of two close particles makes them see local velocity increments fluctuate fast and we introduce the corresponding Langevin description for separation dynamics. This allows to describe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of Richardson's law for separation above viscous scale.
D2-82	A PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that allows doctors to observe the metabolic activity of tissues and organs in the body. It involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer (a substance containing a radioactive atom) into the bloodstream. This tracer is typically a form of glucose that is metabolized by cells. The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the tracer, creating detailed images that show how tissues are functioning, rather than just their structure. PET scans are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders (such as Alzheimer’s disease). They are especially useful in identifying abnormal cell activity, which can help detect cancerous tumors.
1094	"The research paper titled ""Une plate-forme dynamique pour l' valuation des performances des bases de donn es   objets"" highlights the development of a dynamic platform for evaluating the performance of object-oriented databases. The primary theme of the paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key characteristics and performance metrics of object-oriented databases. The paper presents the results of experiments conducted on the platform, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for evaluating database performance. The study concludes that the platform can be a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different object-oriented databases."
1214	The research paper proposes a new approach to Gaussian layered broadcast coding with successive refinement that aims to minimize expected distortion. The approach involves creating a layered structure with multiple encoding layers, where each layer provides additional refinement to the previously encoded layers. The authors derive an expression for the minimum expected distortion achievable using this approach and show that it is achievable through a practical coding scheme. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms them in terms of expected distortion. The main conclusion of the paper is that the proposed approach provides an effective method for achieving high-quality broadcast coding with successive refinement.
1804	This research paper explores the relationship between two measures of complexity in formal language theory: bounded pushdown dimension (BPD) and Lempel-Ziv information density (LZID). BPD is a measure of the amount of memory required to recognize a language, while LZID measures the amount of compression that can be achieved for a given language. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that BPD and LZID are highly correlated for a range of languages, suggesting that they capture similar aspects of language complexity. Moreover, we show that these measures can be used to distinguish between different classes of languages and to predict the performance of various parsing algorithms. Our findings have important implications for the design and optimization of natural language processing systems.
915	This research paper examines the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) through surveys conducted by the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project, from the Burst Alert Telescope Swift Survey (BATSS) to the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST). The study investigates the temporal behavior of AGN in different energy bands and spatial distributions. The research employs a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the light curves and identify AGN candidates. The results reveal a significant increase in the number of AGN detected by DASCH from BATSS to EXIST, indicating the potential for future surveys to uncover new insights into AGN variability and evolution. These findings have implications for understanding the physics of AGN and their role in the broader astrophysical context.
D2-35	"Einstein and Schrödinger exchanged significant ideas throughout their careers. Both physicists shared deep skepticism about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, maintaining a correspondence that revealed their mutual discomfort with quantum indeterminism. Einstein's famous quote, ""God does not play dice with the universe,"" echoed Schrödinger's own reservations. Their intellectual relationship flourished through letters and occasional meetings, where they discussed unified field theory and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment partially emerged from these discussions, attempting to illustrate what both considered absurdities in quantum theory. Though they never resolved their concerns about quantum mechanics, their dialogue represented one of the most profound scientific exchanges of the 20th century, challenging mainstream quantum interpretations while searching for deeper truths."
218	This is an incomplete survey of some non-Abelian discrete symmetries which have been used recently in attempts to understand the flavor structure of leptons and quarks. To support such symmetries, new scalar particles are required. In some models, they are very massive, in which case there may not be much of a trace of their existence at the TeV scale. In other models, they are themselves at the TeV scale, in which case there is a reasonable chance for them to be revealed at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.
1554	This research paper explores the relationship between modules over operads and functors, focusing on the structure of these objects and their interactions. Operads are algebraic structures that capture the notion of composition in various mathematical contexts, while functors are transformations between categories that preserve structure. This paper examines how modules over operads and functors relate to one another, including the construction of free modules and the algebraic properties of these objects. The paper also explores applications of these concepts in areas such as algebraic topology and homological algebra. Overall, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the connections between operads, functors, and their associated modules, shedding light on the fundamental algebraic structures underlying many branches of mathematics.
2691	This research paper investigates the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight within the framework of the rotationally-invariant slave-boson formalism. The slave-boson formalism is a powerful tool for describing strongly correlated electron systems, and a rotationally-invariant version has been developed to accurately capture the effects of anisotropy in the electron system. We apply this formalism to investigate the quasiparticle weight, which characterizes the strength of the interactions between electrons and their surrounding environment. Our results show that the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight is strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the system, and we provide a detailed analysis of this effect. This research has important implications for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems, and may provide insights into the design of new materials with desirable electronic properties.
1637	In this research paper, we investigate the atom-molecule Rabi oscillations in a Mott insulator using a two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Our primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of the system and the emergence of coherent atom-molecule oscillations. We find that the oscillations are strongly influenced by the interaction strength and the initial state of the system. We also observe a suppression of the oscillations for large interaction strengths. Our findings provide insights into the behavior of atom-molecule systems in a Mott insulator and have important implications for the development of quantum technologies.
2927	We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities, timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
2570	Simple geometrical considerations show that the collision zone in high energy nuclear collisions may be divided into a central part (``core''), with high energy densities, and a peripheral part (``corona''), with smaller energy densities, more like in pp or pA collisions. We present calculations which allow to separate these two contributions, and which show that the corona contribution is quite small (but not negligible) for central collisions, but gets increasingly important with decreasing centrality. We will discuss consequences concerning results obtained in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).
970	There is evidence for the existence of massive planets at orbital radii of several hundred AU from their parent stars where the timescale for planet formation by core accretion is longer than the disc lifetime. These planets could have formed close to their star and then migrated outwards. We consider how the transfer of angular momentum by viscous disc interactions from a massive inner planet could cause significant outward migration of a smaller outer planet. We find that it is in principle possible for planets to migrate to large radii. We note, however, a number of effects which may render the process somewhat problematic.
3676	We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.
2146	This research paper focuses on information theoretic proofs of entropy power inequalities. The primary objective is to establish a unified framework for deriving entropy power inequalities for various classes of probability distributions. The significant findings of the study include the development of a novel proof technique that can be used to establish entropy power inequalities for a broad range of probability distributions, regardless of their specific properties. The study concludes that the proposed framework can help to simplify the derivation of entropy power inequalities, leading to more efficient and effective communication system designs.
901	This research paper explores the concept of Glicci simplicial complexes, a type of simplicial complex with certain favorable properties. The paper presents a comprehensive study of these complexes, including their definition, properties, and classification into different types. The critical outcomes of this research include the characterization of the topological properties of Glicci simplicial complexes, their relationship with other types of simplicial complexes, and their applications in a variety of fields, such as topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of Glicci simplicial complexes in advancing our understanding of the underlying structures of mathematical objects.
3114	This research paper investigates the presence of smooth and starburst tidal tails in the GEMS and GOODS fields using multi-wavelength data. Our analysis reveals a significant number of galaxies with tidal tails, with a higher incidence of smooth tails in the GEMS field and starburst tails in the GOODS field. We also find that the presence of tidal tails is correlated with other galaxy properties, such as size, mass, and star formation rate. Our findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe.
852	The relation between the deconfinement and chiral phase transition is explored in the framework of an Polyakov-loop-extended two-flavor quark-meson (PQM) model. In this model the Polyakov loop dynamics is represented by a background temporal gauge field which also couples to the quarks. As a novelty an explicit quark chemical potential and N_f-dependence in the Polyakov loop potential is proposed by using renormalization group arguments. The behavior of the Polyakov loop as well as the chiral condensate as function of temperature and quark chemical potential is obtained by minimizing the grand canonical thermodynamic potential of the system. The effect of the Polyakov loop dynamics on the chiral phase diagram and on several thermodynamic bulk quantities is presented.
419	We review Maxwell's multipole vectors, and elucidate some of their mathematical properties, with emphasis on the application of this tool to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, for a completely random function on the sphere (corresponding to the statistically isotropic Gaussian model of the CMB), we derive the full probability density function of the multipole vectors. This function is used to analyze the internal configurations of the third-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe quadrupole and octopole, and we show the observations are consistent with the Gaussian prediction. A particular aspect is the planarity of the octopole, which we find not to be anomalous.
2271	The study of excited states in solids is essential for understanding the electronic and optical properties of materials. Ab initio wavefunction-based methods are powerful tools for calculating excited states in solids, but they often neglect important correlation effects. This research paper aims to investigate the impact of correlation corrections on the band structure of ionic oxides using ab initio wavefunction-based methods. A systematic analysis of the correlation effects on the electronic structure of ionic oxides will be performed. The results will provide insights into the nature of electronic excitations in these materials and will pave the way for the design of novel materials with tailored electronic properties.
2239	This research paper investigates the magnetic field penetration in a type-I superconductor and provides evidence for nonmonotonic behavior. The main objective of this study is to understand the complex behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields. The authors conducted experiments on a lead sample and used a sensitive magnetometer to measure the magnetic field inside the superconductor. The results show that the magnetic field penetration is not a monotonic function of the applied field, but instead exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with a peak in the penetration depth. This suggests that the magnetic field interacts with the superconducting electrons in a complex and nontrivial way. The study provides important insights into the behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields and could have implications for the design of superconducting devices.
427	We discuss the extrema of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with different physical properties. We have found necessary and sufficient conditions for realization of the extrema with different properties as the vacuum state of the model. We found explicit equations for extremum energies via parameters of potential if it has explicitly CP conserving form. These equations allow to pick out extremum with lower energy -- vacuum state and to look for change of extrema (phase transitions) with the variation of parameters of potential. Our goal is to find general picture here to apply it for description of early Universe.
3479	This research paper proposes a new principle, called the Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) principle, which can be applied to molecular dynamics trajectories. The BEP principle states that the activation energy for a reaction can be estimated from the minimum energy along the intrinsic reaction coordinate. The paper shows that this principle can be used to guide global optimization methods for finding the lowest energy conformations of molecules. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several molecular systems and conclude that the BEP principle can provide a valuable tool for accelerating global optimization algorithms in computational chemistry.
D2-69	Lavoisier was born in 1743 into a wealthy family of lawyers, and initially prepared for a legal career, being awarded a baccalaureate in law in 1763. Antoine Lavoisier played the central role in what has come to be known as the chemical revolution and he was active also in agricultural and fiscal reform as well as technological development. He is credited with establishing that oxygen is an element and water its compound with hydrogen, refining experimental methods in chemistry, reforming chemical nomenclature along systematic lines, defining element operationally, and denying phlogiston a place in chemical explanation. This chapter critically examines the analytical conception of the elements that Lavoisier proposes.

3817	"We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product."
1394	This research paper presents the results of the analysis of three transits of the exoplanet TrES-2 as part of The Transit Light Curve Project. Observations were conducted using the Kepler Space Telescope and the light curve was analyzed using various techniques to determine the planet's physical characteristics, such as its size, orbital period, and atmospheric composition.

The study concludes that further investigation into this area could provide valuable insights into the nature and distribution of PBHs in the universe.

The primary focus is on studying the variations in the mechanical properties of the nanotubes at different temperatures. The outcomes suggest that the Young's modulus of the nanotubes decreases with increasing temperature, while the ultimate tensile strength decreases only slightly. The study also reveals that the deformation mechanisms of the nanotubes vary with temperature. Conclusively, the findings have significant implications for the design and development of nanotube-based materials for high-temperature applications.
1733	This research paper presents a semiclassical theory for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing-gap fluctuations in superconductors. The primary theme is to understand the effects of thermal fluctuations on the pairing-gap structure. The analysis shows that the semiclassical approach provides a more accurate description of the pairing-gap fluctuations than the previous theories based on the Gaussian approximation. The significant finding of this research is that the semiclassical theory predicts a power-law dependence of the pairing-gap fluctuations on temperature, which was not observed in the earlier theories. The conclusion of this research is that the semiclassical theory provides a more refined and accurate description of the pairing-gap fluctuations in superconductors.
3884	"The research paper titled ""The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations"" explores the formation and evolution of binary stars in star clusters. The authors used computer simulations to create realistic models of star clusters, and analyzed the binary fractions in the core regions of these clusters. They found that the binary fraction in the core region depends on the initial conditions of the cluster, with denser clusters having higher binary fractions. They also found that binary stars in the core region tend to be more massive than those in the outer regions. The authors conclude that binary stars are an important factor in the dynamical evolution of star clusters, and that understanding their formation and evolution is crucial for understanding the properties of star clusters."
3919	This research paper explores the bursting dynamics of the 3D Euler equations in cylindrical domains. The study investigates the characteristics of the solutions of the equations and their behavior during the bursting phenomenon.

The conclusions of the research provide insights into the physical mechanisms that govern the bursting dynamics in cylindrical domains and their implications for various applications in fluid mechanics.
2222	The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response to stimuli.
1937	The paper proposes a new approach for inferring dynamic genetic networks using low order independencies. The method is based on partial correlation and uses a dynamic Bayesian network to model the time-varying relationships between genes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on simulated data and a real-world gene expression dataset. The results show that the approach is able to accurately infer the underlying network structure and identify important regulatory interactions. This method provides a promising tool for studying complex genetic systems and may have practical applications in personalized medicine and drug development.

Teleportation has been a popular theme in science fiction, with depictions ranging from simple matter transportation to more complex scenarios such as time and space travel. This paper examines how visual representations of teleportation have evolved over time, and how they reflect our changing understanding of the concept. It also investigates the impact of these visualizations on public perception and acceptance of teleportation as a potential future technology. Through an analysis of science fiction films, television shows, and literature, this paper aims to provide insights into the role of popular culture in shaping our ideas about technology and its potential applications.
2408	In this paper, photonic entanglement and interference are described and analyzed with the language of quantum information process. Correspondingly, a photon state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a new expression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression, each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operations on photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is well interpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement between different degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric down conversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photon state. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interference visibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.

This paper examines the possibility of dark matter decay as a solution to cosmic gamma ray anomalies by analyzing data from gamma ray telescopes and simulations of dark matter decay. The results of this study will provide insight into the nature of dark matter and its potential role in cosmic gamma ray anomalies.
194	Coherent Harmonic Generation (CHG), and in particular Nonlinear Harmonic Generation (NHG), is of importance for both short wavelength Free-Electron Lasers (FELs), in relation with the achievement of shorter wavelengths with a fixed electron-beam energy, and high-average power FEL resonators, in relation with destructive effects of higher harmonics radiation on mirrors. In this paper we present a treatment of NHG from helical wigglers with particular emphasis on the second harmonic. Our study is based on an exact analytical solution of Maxwell's equations, derived with the help of a Green's function method. In particular, we demonstrate that nonlinear harmonic generation (NHG) from helical wigglers vanishes on axis. Our conclusion is in open contrast with results in literature, that include a kinematical mistake in the description of the electron motion.

Furthermore, we find that the MHV rules simplify the calculation of amplitudes, enabling more accurate predictions of physical observables. Our study highlights the potential of the MHV rules for future research in pure Yang-Mills theory and beyond.

3490	The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper. Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii) the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism, characterized by the number of cams and their width.
2350	This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By using noncooperative game-theoretic models and large system analysis, explicit expressions are derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects of self- and multiple-access interference at a receiving access point. Performance of the PRake is compared in terms of achieved utilities and loss to that of the all-Rake receiver.

The paper concludes that coupled micro-cavities provide a promising platform for the realization of effective spin systems with potential applications in quantum information processing and communication."
2323	"We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation, based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The temperature in such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation of vortex motion in superfluids."

The results show that the scheme is able to accurately predict the radiation flux and energy deposition in the media. Additionally, the scheme is found to be efficient in terms of computational time and memory usage. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the finite volume-finite element scheme in modeling nuclear transport phenomena.

Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers analyze the color-magnitude diagrams of the stars in the cluster and find evidence for a DMSTO. This phenomenon is associated with the presence of multiple generations of stars in a cluster, which has important implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and the formation of star clusters. The authors discuss possible scenarios for the origin of the DMSTO and suggest further observations to confirm their findings.
2543	We study the unfolding of a single polymer chain due to an external force. We use a simplified model which allows to perform all calculations in closed form without assuming a Boltzmann-Gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution. Temperature is then defined by calculating the Legendre transform of the entropy under certain constraints. The application of the model is limited to flexible polymers. It exhibits a gradual transition from compact globule to rod. The boundary line between these two phases shows reentrant behavior. This behavior is explained by the presence of residual entropy.

For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.
215	The paper investigates the distribution of entropy production for a colloidal particle in a nonequilibrium steady state. The authors use a stochastic thermodynamics approach to model the system and derive the probability density function of entropy production. They find that the distribution of entropy production is non-Gaussian and can be described by a power law. Additionally, they show that the mean entropy production is proportional to the applied force, providing insight into the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states. Overall, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems and may have important implications for the design of nanoscale devices.

705	Using the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and the (non self-consistent) GW approach, the (quasi-particle) band structure is calculated for MnTe in zinc-blende geometry. Different parameters characterizing the electronic structure are computed for an antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase and compared with the experiment. The strong Hubbard-type repulsion on the Mn-3d orbitals and the p-d hybridization are seen to be responsible for substantial defects found in the LSDA picture. It is discussed to which extent these can be improved upon by means of the GW approach.

3195	We define and solve the toric version of the symplectic ball packing problem, in the sense of listing all 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds which admit a perfect packing by balls embedded in a symplectic and torus equivariant fashion. In order to do this we first describe a problem in geometric-combinatorics which is equivalent to the toric symplectic ball packing problem. Then we solve this problem using arguments from Convex Geometry and Delzant theory. Applications to symplectic blowing-up are also presented, and some further questions are raised in the last section.
1730	Photoluminescence is commonly used to identify the electronic structure of individual nanotubes. But, nanotubes naturally occur in bundles. Thus, we investigate photoluminescence of nanotube bundles. We show that their complex spectra are simply explained by exciton energy transfer between adjacent tubes, whereby excitation of large gap tubes induces emission from smaller gap ones via Forster interaction between excitons. The consequent relaxation rate is faster than non-radiative recombination, leading to enhanced photoluminescence of acceptor tubes. This fingerprints bundles with different compositions and opens opportunities to optimize them for opto-electronics.
3662	We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.

The main theme of the paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric turbulence and its impacts on atmospheric transport and mixing. The study uses observational data and numerical simulations to examine the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations. The noteworthy results of the research suggest that large scale intermittency is a universal feature of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, and that it has significant implications for the transport and dispersion of air pollutants. The paper concludes that a better understanding of large scale intermittency is crucial for improving air quality models and predicting the dispersion of air pollutants in urban environments.
3107	Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body Peierls'' state.

Educational robots are used both in and out of school environments to enhance K–12 students’ interest, engagement, and academic achievement in various fields of STEM education. Some prior studies show evidence for the general benefits of educational robotics as being effective in providing impactful learning experiences. However, there appears to be a need to determine the specific benefits which have been achieved through robotics implementation in K–12 formal and informal learning settings. In this study, we present a systematic review of the literature on K–12 educational robotics.

658	This research paper focuses on the effects of extragalactic background light (EBL) on cascading in the universe. The study utilizes numerical simulations to demonstrate how the presence of EBL can affect the propagation and scattering of high-energy photons from distant sources. The results indicate that EBL can significantly impact the observed spectra of gamma-ray sources, with implications for our understanding of the universe's evolution and the nature of high-energy astrophysical processes. The study concludes that a more comprehensive understanding of EBL is essential for accurately interpreting observations of extragalactic gamma-ray sources and for improving our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties.
D2-28	Fossils have played a significant role in shaping Greek mythology, as ancient Greeks often interpreted large, mysterious bones as evidence of mythical creatures. The discovery of massive fossils, such as those of mammoths, mastodons, and prehistoric reptiles, likely influenced myths about giants, cyclopes, and dragons. For instance, the large skulls of prehistoric elephants, which have a central nasal cavity, may have been mistaken for the skulls of one-eyed Cyclopes, reinforcing the legend of these formidable beings. Similarly, fossilized bones of large extinct animals could have inspired stories of titans and heroes slaying monstrous beasts. Greek naturalists like Herodotus and Pliny the Elder documented fossil findings, showing early attempts to explain these remains within a mythological and historical framework.
1174	In cuprate superconductors doping is believed to create holes on the O-sites, which couple antiferromagnetically with holes on the Cu-sites to form the so-called Zhang-Rice singlets. Here we study a d-wave pairing state based on the Zhang-Rice singlet states. Upper and lower bounds of an off-diagonal long-range order parameter with d-wave symmetry for this state are estimated. We also introduce a concrete model with on-site Coulomb repulsion and kinds of antiferromagnetic interactions whose ground state is this d-wave pairing state.
3126	This research paper investigates the invariants of triangular Lie algebras, a special class of Lie algebras with a triangular decomposition. The main objective of this study is to identify and classify the invariants of such Lie algebras, which are essential for understanding the algebraic structures of various physical systems. We explore the relationship between the Lie algebra structure and its invariants, and prove that for triangular Lie algebras, these invariants are determined by the structure constants of the algebra. We also establish the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial invariants and provide explicit examples of such invariants. Our findings suggest that the invariants of triangular Lie algebras play a crucial role in the study of Lie algebraic structures and their applications in physics and other fields.
3903	The research paper investigates the impact of node deletion on the structure of complex networks. Through simulations on various network models, the study reveals that the removal of a small number of highly connected nodes can lead to a significant disruption in network connectivity and increase network vulnerability. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the rate of network collapse is dependent on the network's initial structure and the deletion strategy employed. These results have important implications for network design and management, particularly in fields such as transportation, communication, and social networks.
D2-95	Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. PET is a common imaging technique, a medical scintillography technique used in nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical – a radioisotope attached to a drug – is injected into the body as a tracer. When the radiopharmaceutical undergoes beta plus decay, a positron is emitted, and when the positron interacts with an ordinary electron, the two particles annihilate and two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.
1772	We use optical tweezers to perform stretching experiments on DNA molecules when interacting with the drugs daunomycin and ethidium bromide, which intercalate the DNA molecule. These experiments are performed in the low-force regime from zero up to 2 pN. Our results show that the persistence length of the DNA-drug complexes increases strongly as the drug concentration increases up to some critical value. Above this critical value, the persistence length decreases abruptly and remains practically constant for larger drug concentrations. The contour length of the molecules increases monotonically and saturates as drugs concentration increases. Measured in- tercalants critical concentrations for the persistence length transition coincide with reported values for the helix-coil transition of DNA-drug complexes, obtained from sedimentation experiments.
2377	"The research paper titled ""Magnetosonic solitons in a Fermionic quantum plasma"" explores the formation and behavior of magnetosonic solitons in a quantum plasma consisting of fermions. The study is based on theoretical calculations and simulations using the quantum hydrodynamic equations. The research found that the presence of fermions in the plasma has a significant impact on the formation and propagation of magnetosonic solitons. The results showed that the solitons have a lower amplitude and a wider distribution compared to those in a classical plasma. Additionally, the solitons exhibit particle-like behavior, suggesting that they can be considered as quasiparticles in the quantum plasma. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of magnetosonic solitons in quantum plasmas and could have implications for future research in areas such as astrophysics and fusion energy."
1853	Ferromagnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (FMRFM) offers a means of performing local ferromagnetic resonance. We have studied the evolution of the FMRFM force spectra in a continuous 50 nm thick permalloy film as a function of probe-film distance and performed numerical simulations of the intensity of the FMRFM probe-film interaction force, accounting for the presence of the localized strongly nonuniform magnetic field of the FMRFM probe magnet. Excellent agreement between the experimental data and the simulation results provides insight into the mechanism of FMR mode excitation in an FMRFM experiment.
3951	This research paper investigates the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of spin transfer torque and microwave generation in magnetic tunnel junctions utilizing a spin valve structure. The results show that the angular dependence of the spin transfer torque can be controlled by the shape of the magnetic tunnel junction, which affects the microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study concludes that the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque is a significant factor in controlling microwave generation without a magnetic field, which has potential applications in spintronics and nanoelectronics.
3339	The possibility that around some astrophysical objects there are non-static magnetic fields of enormous intensity suggests that in these situations real particles may be produced. The slowness of the variation is compensated by the huge intensity. The main issue is the production of e+,e- pairs annihilating into photons and the direct production of photons, as one of the concurrent process in the GRB (gamma ray bursts). Then some simple effects due to the presence of the intense gravity are studied and finally a look is given to the production of other kinds of particles.

523	In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of accelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of space-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe. This interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some experimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated expansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale.
1474	We study properties of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in the background of k NS5-branes, with one transverse direction compactified on a circle, from the point of view of Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We present the analysis of two different embedding of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in given background and study the classical solutions of given world-volume theory. We argue for the configuration of a non-BPS D(p+1)-brane which allows us to find solutions of the equations of motion that give unified descriptions of G and U-type branes.
1476	Experiments built to search for neutrinoless double beta-decay are limited in their sensitivity not only by the exposure but also by the amount of background encountered. Radioactive isotopes in the surrounding of the detectors which emit gamma-radiation are expected to be a significant source of background in the GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA. Methods to select electron induced events and discriminate against photon induced events inside a germanium detector are presented in this paper. The methods are based on the analysis of the time structure of the detector response. Data were taken with a segmented GERDA prototype detector. It is shown that the analysis of the time response of the detector can be used to distinguish multiply scattered photons from electrons.
173	The discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation. In contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models, in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization, together with a fine-tuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations, render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur. The energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations.
2371	This research paper investigates the effects of edge oxidation on the electronic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). Specifically, we explore the possibility of enhancing the half-metallicity of ZGNRs through edge oxidation. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of edge-oxidized ZGNRs. Our results demonstrate that edge oxidation can significantly enhance the half-metallicity of ZGNRs. We also investigate the effects of different edge oxidation configurations on the electronic properties of ZGNRs. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the potential applications of edge-oxidized ZGNRs in spintronics and electronic devices.

Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes and provides a framework for further investigation in this field.
3300	Hydrocarbon anions have been detected in various interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes, providing important insights into the chemical processes occurring in these environments. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the detection, properties, and formation mechanisms of hydrocarbon anions in interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes. Theoretical and experimental studies of the structures and reactivity of these anions are discussed, with a particular focus on their potential roles in the formation of larger organic molecules. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the origin of life and the evolution of planetary systems are also considered. Overall, the detection of hydrocarbon anions in these environments highlights the richness and complexity of interstellar chemistry and underscores the importance of continued research in this field.
1628	We show that condensation in a capped capillary slit is a continuous interfacial critical phenomenon, related intimately to several other surface phase transitions. In three dimensions (3d), the adsorption and desorption branches correspond to the unbinding of the meniscus from the cap and opening, respectively and are equivalent to 2d-like complete-wetting transitions. For dispersion forces, the singularities on the two branches are distinct, owing to the different interplay of geometry and intermolecular forces. In 2d we establish precise connection, or covariance, with 2d critical-wetting and wedge-filling transitions, i.e. we establish that certain interfacial properties in very different geometries are identical. Our predictions of universal scaling and covariance in finite capillaries are supported by extensive Ising model simulation studies in 2d and 3d.
3821	We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.
2012	Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the number of matches is known or not in advance.

3499	This research paper focuses on the tuning of the shape of a semiconductor microstadium laser. The study investigates the impact of changes in the geometry of the microstadium on its lasing properties. The research team utilizes simulations to explore the effects of various design parameters such as the radius and width of the stadium.

The conclusions of the study suggest that tuning the shape of the microstadium is a promising approach for optimizing the performance of semiconductor lasers.
3838	This research paper focuses on hydrodynamic and spectral simulations of High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) winds. The study utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the properties of the wind from HMXBs, specifically examining the effect of the binary system's parameters on the wind's dynamics. The results demonstrate that the wind's properties are strongly correlated with the binary system's parameters and that the wind's behavior is significantly affected by the presence of the companion star. These findings highlight the importance of considering binary system parameters when studying HMXB wind properties. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into HMXB wind dynamics, contributing to a better understanding of the properties of these complex systems.
2715	This research paper presents a study of physical parameters of evolved stars in clusters and in the field using line-depth ratios. The authors use high-resolution spectra of 56 red giants to determine their effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. They find that the cluster stars have a smaller range of physical parameters compared to field stars, likely due to their common origin and age. The paper also highlights the potential of using line-depth ratios as a powerful tool for studying evolved stars in both cluster and field environments.
2530	This research paper investigates the spin-polarized transport properties of weakly coupled double quantum dots in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Using a numerical simulation approach, the authors examine the effects of magnetic fields and spin polarization on the transport characteristics of the system. They find that spin-polarized transport can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field and bias voltage, and that the spin polarization can be enhanced by increasing the coupling between the quantum dots. The authors conclude that these findings could have important implications for the development of spintronic devices, which rely on the manipulation of electron spin for information storage and processing.
1042	We present a lattice Boltzmann algorithm based on an underlying free energy that allows the simulation of the dynamics of a multicomponent system with an arbitrary number of components. The thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential of each component and the pressure of the overall system, are incorporated in the model. We derived a symmetrical convection diffusion equation for each component as well as the Navier Stokes equation and continuity equation for the overall system. The algorithm was verified through simulations of binary and ternary systems. The equilibrium concentrations of components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree well with theoretical expectations.
298	Using former maps, geographers intend to study the evolution of the land cover in order to have a prospective approach on the future landscape; predictions of the future land cover, by the use of older maps and environmental variables, are usually done through the GIS (Geographic Information System). We propose here to confront this classical geographical approach with statistical approaches: a linear parametric model (polychotomous regression modeling) and a nonparametric one (multilayer perceptron). These methodologies have been tested on two real areas on which the land cover is known at various dates; this allows us to emphasize the benefit of these two statistical approaches compared to GIS and to discuss the way GIS could be improved by the use of statistical models.
2100	Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.
815	The unbinding process of a protein-ligand complex of major biological interest was investigated by means of a computational approach at atomistic classical mechanical level. An energy minimisation-based technique was used to determine the dissociation paths of the system by probing only a relevant set of generalized coordinates. The complex problem was reduced to a low-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and the ligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) were also assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effects were accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. The corresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height, in compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour. The computed results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.
2026	This research paper deals with the numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy, a measure of the degree of disorder in a system. The paper presents a methodology to estimate critical parameters based on the Bond entropy, which has been shown to be a useful tool for characterizing phase transitions in a variety of physical systems. The authors apply this methodology to a range of systems, including the Ising model, the Potts model, and the XY model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately estimating the critical parameters of these systems. The paper concludes that the Bond entropy is a powerful tool for studying phase transitions and can be used to accurately estimate critical parameters in a variety of physical systems.
48	The low-snr capacity of M-ary PSK transmission over both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero snr are obtained. The spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.
759	Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been discovered in the X-ray emission of many neutron stars and black holes. The QPOs with frequencies greater than about 300 Hz are thought to be produced near the surfaces of neutron stars and the event horizons of black holes. I first summarize some of the most important properties of the QPOs seen in neutron star and black hole systems. I then review some of the models that have been proposed and compare them with observational data. Finally, I describe how these QPOs can be used to determine the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields.
2952	We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.
834	We study the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium of magnetic flux tubes with circular cross sections embedded in a magnetic surrounding atmosphere. We solve the static momentum equation in 2.5D to obtain the thermodynamics that are consistent with a prescribed velocity and magnetic fields. We show that force balance is roughly satisfied if the flux tube's magnetic field is aligned with its axis. Equilibrium is guaranteed if this magnetic field possesses a transverse component. Several forms of this transverse field are investigated. The resulting magnetic field configurations are critically reviewed in terms of the results from spectropolarimetric observations. The thermodynamic structure that allows the flux tube to be in mechanical equilibrium is also calculated. We show that the inferred pressure, density and temperature stratification reproduce intensity features similar to dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains.
1542	In this paper we suggest a theoretical method based on the statistical mechanics for treating the alpha-helix-random coil transition in alanine polypeptides. We consider this process as a first-order phase transition and develop a theory which is free of model parameters and is based solely on fundamental physical principles. It describes essential thermodynamical properties of the system such as heat capacity, the phase transition temperature and others from the analysis of the polypeptide potential energy surface calculated as a function of two dihedral angles, responsible for the polypeptide twisting. The suggested theory is general and with some modification can be applied for the description of phase transitions in other complex molecular systems (e.g. proteins, DNA, nanotubes, atomic clusters, fullerenes).
4040	This research paper explores the optimal shape design for Stokes flow through the use of minimax differentiability.

The results indicate that the proposed methodology achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost and provides accurate solutions for the optimal shape design problem. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering minimax differentiability in the design optimization process for Stokes flow systems. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the optimal shape design for Stokes flow and offers a promising approach for future research in fluid mechanics and optimization.
2599	"Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after ""big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2 galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGN/quasar population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN, focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."
3447	The phonon dynamics in a one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain coupled to finite-frequency bond phonons is studied. We present the first detailed phonon spectra for these systems using Quantum Monte Carlo. The quantum phase transition is dominated by a central peak, yet the renormalisation of the main phonon branch depends strongly on the bare phonon frequency omega_0. The main branch remains largely unaffected at omega_0 \gsim J, but it softens completely when omega_0 is low enough. This is an unusual scenario for a structural phase transition and was observable only on sufficiently large systems. Approaching the dimerized phase from finite temperature, the lattice dynamics mirrors the behavior of a three dimensional system. For the efficient measurement of Greens functions, we introduce a mapping from the stochastic series expansion to continuous imaginary time.
3091	Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) is a theoretical framework that proposes the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions in a higher dimensional space. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are two experimental facilities that can test GHU predictions and shed light on the nature of the Higgs boson and the origin of mass. In this research paper, we review recent developments in GHU and discuss their implications for LHC and ILC searches, including the possibility of discovering new particles and interactions. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of GHU and the importance of precision measurements to distinguish between different scenarios. Our analysis suggests that GHU can provide a compelling explanation for the hierarchy problem and offer new avenues for exploring the fundamental nature of the universe.
D2-98	Plasticizers like phthalates were thought to be mainly hormone disruptors. They caused fertility problems and adverse developmental effects. Surprisingly, since the 2000s researchers noted that they were instrumental in causing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another key point, phthalates can be absorbed through the skin, ingested by mouth or inhaled. In order to understand how phthalates cause cardiovascular disease, we need to investigate the effects of phthalates on fatty tissue. Phthalates have a negative effect on fatty tissue that leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Fat cells develop out of adipose stem cells committing themselves and maturing into fatty cells that can store lipids. This process has the name adipogenesis.
1047	"The electronic structure of nanowires in contact with metallic electrodes of experimentally relevant sizes is calculated by incorporating the electrostatic polarization potential into the atomistic single particle Schr\""odinger equation. We show that the presence of an electrode produces localized electron/hole states near the electrode, a phenomenon only exhibited in nanostructures and overlooked in the past. This phenomenon will have profound implications on electron transport in such nanosystems. We calculate several electrode/nanowire geometries, with varying contact depths and nanowire radii. We demonstrate the change in the band gap of up to 0.5 eV in 3 nm diameter CdSe nanowires and calculate the magnitude of the applied electric field necessary to overcome the localization."
3657	"Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity."
2632	The research paper explores rigidly rotating dust solutions in the context of harmonic functions. The primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of dust particles in a rotating system and the role of harmonic functions in determining their behavior. The study shows that the solutions are dependent on the harmonic functions, and the resulting motion of the dust particles is influenced by the rotation and the distribution of mass. The outcomes highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical structures governing the motion of dust particles in rotating systems and provide insights into the dynamics of astrophysical objects such as galaxies. Ultimately, the study contributes to the broader field of astrophysics by enhancing our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of celestial objects.
400	This research paper investigates the fundamental limits to position determination by concentration gradients. The use of concentration gradients has shown promising results in various applications, including biomedicine and environmental monitoring. However, the accuracy of position determination is limited by several factors, including the diffusion of particles and the sensitivity of sensors. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of these limitations, taking into account the properties of the gradient, the sensing mechanism, and the surrounding environment. The results show that the achievable accuracy is highly dependent on the specific application and the design parameters. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the development of more efficient and reliable concentration gradient-based position determination systems.
3634	This research paper investigates the regions of feasible point-to-point trajectories in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators. The study aims to identify the geometric constraints that restrict the end-effector's motion and determine the feasible regions of motion. The research employs mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to develop a methodology for analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the manipulator's geometry in determining the feasible regions of motion and provide insights into the design of parallel manipulators for optimal performance. The research concludes that the proposed methodology is effective in analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators and can be used in the design and optimization of these systems.
1908	In this article we show that the Holevo capacity of a classical quantum channel, can be reached not only by a POVM but by von Neumann measurement too. Furthermore we show two use of this fact 1) We can generalize the classical compound channel to quantum environment and with this new measure technique we can give an optimal coding/decoding algorithm to it. 2) We give an algorithm, with it a classical system can be decoded by quantum apparatus in linear time, which is a surprising result, because best known optimal classical decoding algorithm need n*log(n) time. This means that if a quantum machine can perform arbitrarily von Neumann measurement with only two possible outcome, then it can solve non-polynomial classical problems in linear time.
1251	The configuration space network (CSN) of a dynamical system is an effective approach to represent the ensemble of configurations sampled during a simulation and their dynamic connectivity. To elucidate the connection between the CSN topology and the underlying free-energy landscape governing the system dynamics and thermodynamics, an analytical soluti on is provided to explain the heavy tail of the degree distribution, neighbor co nnectivity and clustering coefficient. This derivation allows to understand the universal CSN network topology observed in systems ranging from a simple quadratic well to the native state of the beta3s peptide and a 2D lattice heteropolymer. Moreover CSN are shown to fall in the general class of complex networks describe d by the fitness model.
3092	A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).
3213	The 6.4 day classical Cepheid AW Per is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 40 years. Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November 2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although we currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the success of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination, sini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs. Since the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the combination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit would give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby providing a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.
2772	"The research paper ""The Limits of Special Relativity"" examines the limitations of the theory of special relativity in the context of high-energy physics. The paper discusses the shortcomings of special relativity in explaining phenomena such as the behavior of particles at high energies and the existence of dark matter. The paper proposes that a more comprehensive theory that accounts for these limitations is needed. The findings indicate that while special relativity is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of particles at low energies, it has limitations in the high-energy regime. Therefore, a more comprehensive theory is needed to explain the behavior of particles at all energy levels."
468	This research paper presents QMC, a model checker specifically designed for quantum systems. The main objective of this work is to develop a tool that can efficiently verify the correctness of quantum protocols and algorithms. QMC is based on a symbolic representation of quantum states and operations, and it supports various types of specifications, including linear-time temporal logic (LTL) and probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL).

The key findings of this work show that QMC is a promising tool for verifying quantum systems, and it can handle larger quantum circuits than existing model checkers. Overall, this paper demonstrates that model checking can be a useful technique for ensuring the correctness of quantum systems.
D1-11	"The basic idea of biological evolution is that populations and species of organisms change over time. Today, when we think of evolution, we are likely to link this idea with one specific person: the British naturalist Charles Darwin. In the 1850s, Darwin wrote an influential and controversial book called On the Origin of Species. In it, he proposed that species evolve (or, as he put it, undergo ""descent with modification""), and that all living things can trace their descent to a common ancestor. Darwin also suggested a mechanism for evolution: natural selection, in which heritable traits that help organisms survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time."
2228	Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.
2903	The study of coherent correlation spectroscopy of excitons in semiconductors has been an area of significant interest for researchers. One of the fundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the sum-over-states or quasiparticle pictures provide a better understanding of the underlying physics. This research paper explores this question and compares the two approaches in the context of femtosecond analogues of multidimensional NMR. Our findings show that the quasiparticle picture offers a more comprehensive understanding of the coherent correlation spectroscopy of excitons in semiconductors. The study sheds light on the importance of the quasiparticle picture and its potential applications in future research.

The findings highlight the importance of distributed approaches in addressing the challenges of wireless network management and provide insights into the design of effective algorithms for future wireless networks.
3110	This research paper explores the use of non-linear methods, specifically fractal and recurrence quantification analysis, to investigate new possible properties of atomic nuclei. The study highlights the potential of these methods in providing a deeper understanding of the complex behavior of atomic nuclei. Noteworthy results include the identification of previously unknown correlations between nuclear properties and the fractal dimension, as well as the discovery of new patterns in the recurrence plots of nuclear data. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued exploration of non-linear methods in nuclear physics research.
3029	We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving on a generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requires an accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the moving charge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergent finite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation also requires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular on the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum regularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presents the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.
2014	We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
1138	We discuss how all variant 10d and 11d maximal supergravities, including star supergravities and supergravities in different signatures, can be obtained as different real slices of three complex actions. As an application we study the recently introduced domain-wall/cosmology correspondence in this approach. We give an example in 9d and 10d where the domain-wall and corresponding cosmology can be viewed as different real slices of the same complex solution. We argue how in this case the pseudo-supersymmetry of the cosmological solutions can be understood as the invariance under supersymmetry of a variant supergravity.

The results of this research have significant implications for our understanding of the early stages of star formation and offer new insights into the properties of protostellar coronae. The findings suggest that VLBI is a promising technique for detecting coronal radio emission from protostars and may provide a unique window into the early evolution of these objects. Overall, this study highlights the potential of VLBI observations for advancing our knowledge of protostellar physics and the early stages of star formation.
905	"The research paper ""Milnor Invariants for Spatial Graphs"" explores the concept of Milnor invariants for spatial graphs, which are graphs embedded in three-dimensional space. The paper presents a method for computing the Milnor invariants of spatial graphs using the Jones polynomial, a well-known invariant in knot theory. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to compute the Milnor invariants for a variety of spatial graphs.

2815	The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems. Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and (x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs, K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...
1131	We show that the centrality and system-size dependence of elliptic flow measured at RHIC are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization. We argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25% below the (ideal) ``hydrodynamic limit'', even for the most central Au-Au collisions. This lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio. We also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data, in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound.

1559	"The thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of Weinhold's and Ruppeiner's thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its phase transition structure."
15	This research paper focuses on the modeling of torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction. The main objective is to understand the behavior of these wires under torsion stress and to predict the corresponding magnetoimpedance response. The study combines experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to determine the magnetoimpedance response under different torsion stress conditions. The findings show that the torsion stress has a significant impact on the magnetoimpedance response, and the negative magnetostriction enhances the effect. The research concludes that the proposed modeling approach can be used to optimize the design of magnetoimpedance sensors for various applications.

These findings have important implications for our understanding of turbulence and for the development of new models and methods for predicting and controlling turbulent flows."

The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the behavior of microtubules and their role in cellular processes.
3955	This research paper explores the reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states. By analyzing the behavior of these values in different systems, it was discovered that their values are not always what one would expect based on classical physics. Specifically, it was found that the expectation values of linear momentum can be zero even when the particle is in motion, and the expectation values of angular momentum can be non-zero even when the system has no net angular momentum. These findings highlight the limitations of classical physics in predicting the behavior of quantum systems and have important implications for understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.

D2-70	Lavoisier’s law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This fundamental principle, proposed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, is crucial to the field of chemistry and science in general. It laid the foundation for modern chemistry by establishing that the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of products. This law enabled scientists to develop more accurate chemical equations and understand that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or annihilation. Lavoisier’s law was vital in refuting earlier theories like the phlogiston theory and is key to stoichiometry.
507	Theory of magnetic deflagration (avalanches) in crystals of molecular magnets has been developed. The phenomenon resembles the burning of a chemical substance, with the Zeeman energy playing the role of the chemical energy. Non-destructive reversible character of magnetic deflagration, as well as the possibility to continuously tune the flammability of the crystal by changing the magnetic field, makes molecular magnets an attractive toy system for a detailed study of the burning process. Besides simplicity, new features, as compared to the chemical burning, include possibility of quantum decay of metastable spin states and strong temperature dependence of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions for criteria of the ignition of magnetic deflagration, and compute the ignition rate and the speed of the developed deflagration front.
1204	Using a general Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian, we study the topological structure and low-lying collective modes of dense QCD having both chiral and diquark condensates, for two and three massless flavors. As we found earlier, the QCD axial anomaly acts as an external field applied to the chiral condensate in a color superconductor and, as a new critical point emerges, leads to a crossover between the broken chiral symmetry and color superconducting phases. At intermediate densities where both chiral and diquark condensates are present, we derive a generalized Gell-Mann- Oakes-Renner relation between the masses of pseudoscalar bosons and the magnitude of the chiral and diquark-condensates. We show explicitly the continuity of the ordinary pion at low densities to a generalized pion at high densities.
3293	We study a simple geometric model of transportation facility that consists of two points between which the travel speed is high. This elementary definition can model shuttle services, tunnels, bridges, teleportation devices, escalators or moving walkways. The travel time between a pair of points is defined as a time distance, in such a way that a customer uses the transportation facility only if it is helpful. We give algorithms for finding the optimal location of such a transportation facility, where optimality is defined with respect to the maximum travel time between two points in a given set.
1761	The research paper discusses the observations of the blazar Mrk 421 during an active phase using the INTEGRAL and multiwavelength telescopes. The study found that the blazar was emitting high-energy gamma rays during the active phase, with the emissions being stronger than those observed during quiescent periods. The observations also revealed a correlation between the high-energy gamma rays and the emission in other energy bands, indicating a common origin for the emissions. The findings suggest that the blazar's emission is produced by accelerated particles interacting with magnetic fields and photons. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the physics of blazar emission and the processes by which these objects release energy.

The results suggest that the doping-induced quantum fluctuations lead to the emergence of new phases in the system, such as a spin-liquid phase and a superconducting phase. Additionally, the study proposes that the phase string theory approach can be used to explain the anomalous behavior of doped cuprate superconductors. Overall, the research paper highlights the potential of the phase string theory approach for understanding the complex behavior of doped antiferromagnets and provides new insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductivity."
3843	I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.
182	The aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a laser in a plasma. At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To solve this huge linear system, one uses a iterative Krylov method with a preconditioning by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightments on the parallel implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture.
3087	The stochastic action principle (SAP) and maximum entropy (ME) are fundamental concepts in statistical physics that provide a unified framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems. This research paper explores the relationship between SAP and ME, and highlights their applications in various fields including thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and information theory. We demonstrate that the SAP and ME principles can be used to derive important results such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Jarzynski equality, and the H-theorem. We also discuss the limitations and challenges in applying these principles to real-world systems, and suggest future directions for research in this area. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of SAP and ME in understanding the behavior of complex systems and provides a foundation for further investigation in this field.
1786	In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm) showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation, whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.
529	We derive an approach to define the causal direction of the wavevector of modes in optical metamaterials, which in turn, determines signs of refractive index and impedance as a function of {\it real and imaginary} parts of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. We use the developed technique to demonstrate that the interplay between resonant response of constituents of metamaterials can be used to achieve efficient dispersion management. Finally we demonstrate broadband dispersion-less index and impedance matching in active nanowire-based negative index materials. Our work opens new practical applications of negative index composites for broadband lensing, imaging, and pulse-routing.
565	This research paper aims to investigate whether the most metal-poor galaxies in the universe are young or not. The study focuses on analyzing the chemical composition of these galaxies and comparing them with the current understanding of stellar evolution and galaxy formation. The results indicate that the metal-poor galaxies are indeed young, with the majority of them being less than 1 billion years old. This conclusion challenges some previous assumptions and understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, suggesting that metal-poor galaxies may be a unique and important population to study further. The research also highlights the need for future observations and studies to better understand the formation and evolution of these intriguing galaxies.
1831	We propose a technique aimed at cooling a harmonically oscillating mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state starting from room temperature. Our method, which involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside an optical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangements being used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping, and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed mostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are expected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror closer to completion.
1249	We provide a general classification of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories that can be obtained from orbifolding of theories with four and eight supercharges. We impose at least one preserved supercharge on the lattice and Lorentz invariance in the naive continuum limit. Starting with four supercharges, we obtain one two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, identical to the one already given in the literature. Starting with eight supercharges, we obtain a unique three-dimensional lattice gauge theory and infinitely many two-dimensional lattice theories. They can be classified according to seven distinct groups, five of which have two preserved supercharges while the others have only one.

It will also explore the scientific goals and objectives of the GREGOR project, which include studying the Sun's atmosphere, understanding the dynamics of solar magnetic fields, and investigating the mechanisms behind solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The paper will conclude by highlighting the potential impact of GREGOR on our understanding of the Sun and its influence on Earth's climate and technology.
3823	Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively.
1415	We study the evolution of the universe which contains a multiple number of non-relativistic scalar fields decaying into both radiation and pressureless matter. We present a powerful analytic formalism to calculate the matter and radiation curvature perturbations, and find that our analytic estimates agree with full numerical results within an error of less than one percent. Also we discuss the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation components, which may be detected by near future cosmological observations, and point out that it crucially depends on the branching ratio of the decay rate of the scalar fields and that it is hard to make any model independent predictions.
2646	This research paper explores a language-based approach for enhancing the resilience of network application protocol implementations. The proposed method employs a programming language that enforces stronger type safety and contracts to minimize errors and vulnerabilities in the protocol implementation.

Results indicate that the language-based approach can significantly reduce the number of errors and improve the overall stability and security of the protocol. The findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of network protocols, particularly in the context of cybersecurity and network reliability.
3727	"Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity."
3286	This research paper aims at understanding the fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by investigating the locally preferred structures. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structural and dynamical properties of the mixtures. The results show that the mixtures exhibit fragility, which is attributed to the formation of locally preferred structures that impede the mobility of the molecules. The study also reveals that the fragility is strongly correlated with the degree of structural ordering and the size of the locally preferred structures. These findings provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fragility in supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in materials science and industrial processes.
1217	This work presents an extended formulation of maximal stiffness design, within the framework of the topology optimization. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation behind the strut-and-tie modeling. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with the help of two examples.
3328	The method of optimized perturbation theory (OPT) is used to study the phase diagram of the massless Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. In the temperature and chemical potential plane, our results give strong support to the existence of a tricritical point and line of first order phase transition, previously only suspected to exist from extensive lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In addition of presenting these results we discuss how the OPT can be implemented in conjunction with the Landau expansion in order to determine all the relevant critical quantities.
1558	This research paper investigates the spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations of the brightest cluster and group galaxies. The main objective is to understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies in the context of their surrounding environments. The study utilizes integral field spectroscopy and imaging data from the MaNGA survey to analyze the kinematics and stellar populations of these galaxies. The key findings include the identification of two distinct populations of brightest cluster galaxies with different kinematic properties and stellar populations. Additionally, the study finds evidence for recent star formation in some of the brightest group galaxies, suggesting that these galaxies are still actively evolving. Overall, the research highlights the importance of considering the environment when studying the formation and evolution of brightest cluster and group galaxies.

Using these measures, the study investigates the pathways of complex systems, such as financial markets and biological networks. The research findings demonstrate that the generalized entropy measures provide a robust framework for characterizing the dynamics of complex systems and their pathways. The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of generalized entropy measures in interdisciplinary research and their potential for developing novel approaches to complex system analysis.
3568	Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators. One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.
2258	Wave-particle duality finds a natural application for electrons or light propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.

931	The efficiency of path sampling simulations can be improved considerably using the approach of path swapping. For this purpose, we have devised a new algorithmic procedure based on the transition interface sampling technique. In the same spirit of parallel tempering, paths between different ensembles are swapped, but the role of temperature is here played by the interface position. We have tested the method on the denaturation transition of DNA using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. We find that the new algorithm gives a reduction of the computational cost by a factor 20.
271	This research paper investigates the Sagnac effect, which is a phase shift that occurs in a mesoscopic electron interferometer due to its rotation. The paper focuses on the role of spin-orbit interactions in this effect and demonstrates that they can significantly affect the phase shift. The researchers used a two-path interferometer to measure the phase shift, and they found that it depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the rotation rate of the interferometer. The results suggest that the Sagnac effect can provide a new way to study spin-orbit interactions in mesoscopic systems. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the fundamental physics of mesoscopic systems and has potential applications in quantum computing and sensing.

3170	We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting, the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling, and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization, where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on the size of nanoparticle.
3872	The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.
D2-5	There were observations of spectral lines. That means there are distinct levels where electrons stay. Classical mechanics does not allow such distinctive levels for electrons to stay. For this new approach is needed. In classical mechanics, energy remains constant. This must be building block. It is my interpretation. Then. he thought that the electrons obey some function distribution which give distinctive levels. This is possible for sin and cos functions. So the electrons should obey sin and cos functions and also obey total energy conservation i.e to start with kinetic energy + potential energy = constant. Potential energy and sin function is not problem, because we know pendulum oscillations. How to modify kinetic energy to give sine function.
2842	This research paper focuses on the many-to-one throughput capacity of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop wireless networks.

Remarkably, the study found that the network's throughput capacity can be significantly improved through efficient node placement and routing protocols, such as the Opportunistic Routing (OR) protocol. The paper concludes that careful design and optimization of network topology and routing protocols can enhance the many-to-one throughput capacity of multi-hop wireless networks.
3484	We consider a network of nodes distributed in physical space without physical links communicating through message broadcasting over specified distances. Typically, communication using smaller distances is desirable due to savings in energy or other resources. We introduce a network formation mechanism to enable reducing the distances while retaining connectivity. Nodes, which initially transmit signals at a prespecified maximum distance, subject links to preferential detachment by autonomously decreasing their transmission radii while satisfying conditions of zero communication loss and fixed maximum node-hopping distance for signaling. Applied to networks with various spatial topologies, we find cost reductions as high as 90% over networks that are restricted to have all nodes with equal transmission distance.

The significant outcome of this research is that the proposed optimum linear LLR calculation method can achieve better decoding performance in fading channels with reduced computational complexity, making it suitable for practical applications that require high data rates and low latency.

1807	This research paper highlights the importance of considering the porosity of hot-star winds to accurately estimate their mass-loss rates. The authors demonstrate that neglecting porosity can lead to significant underestimation of mass-loss rates, which in turn affects our understanding of the evolution of hot stars. The study uses numerical simulations to show that porosity has a strong influence on the wind structure and mass-loss rates of hot stars. The authors conclude that future models of hot-star winds must take into account the effects of porosity to improve our understanding of these important astrophysical phenomena.
D2-34	The main causes of lung cancer are primarily linked to smoking and environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause, responsible for about 85% of cases, as the harmful chemicals in smoke damage DNA in lung cells. Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor. Another major cause is exposure to radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive substance that can accumulate in buildings. Occupational exposures to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust also increase the risk, particularly in certain industries. Additionally, genetic factors and family history can make some individuals more susceptible, while air pollution and poor air quality further contribute to the development of lung cancer.

2747	This research paper presents the results of multisite campaigns on two pulsating subdwarf B stars, PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. The aim of the study was to investigate the pulsation properties of these stars through photometric and spectroscopic observations. The analysis revealed several new pulsation modes in PG 1618+563B and confirmed the presence of previously identified modes in PG 0048+091. Additionally, the results showed that the pulsation properties of these stars are influenced by their atmospheric parameters. Overall, this study provides new insights into the pulsation properties of subdwarf B stars and highlights the importance of multisite campaigns in studying these objects.
3016	"In this research paper titled ""Spin coupling in zigzag Wigner crystals,"" the authors investigate the behavior of the spin coupling in a one-dimensional zigzag Wigner crystal. Using numerical simulations, they demonstrate that the spin coupling is highly sensitive to the geometry of the crystal and can be strongly influenced by the presence of impurities. The authors also show that this behavior is closely related to the finite size effects and the presence of edge states in the system. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the fundamental physics of Wigner crystals and may have important implications for the design of future spintronic devices."
1250	This research paper presents a new method for classifying supersymmetric lattice gauge theories using the concept of orbifolding. The authors introduce a set of criteria that can be used to determine the symmetries and topological properties of these theories. By applying this method to a range of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, the authors are able to identify several distinct classes of theories. They also show that these classes are related to one another through a series of dualities. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.
3390	There is accumulating evidence in lattice QCD that attempts to locate confining fields in vacuum configurations bring results explicitly depending on tha lattice spacing (that is, ultraviolet cut off). Generically, one deals with low-dimensional vacuum defects which occupy a vanishing fraction of the total four-dimensional space. We review briefly existing data on the vacuum defects and their significance for confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena. We introduce the notion of `quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy, rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were triggered by creation of the Sakata model.
3099	The research paper investigates the emergence of nonstationary patterns in unsynchronizable complex networks. The authors introduce a new model and show that the nonstationary patterns are characterized by a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. They also demonstrate that the nonstationary patterns are robust to changes in network topology and connectivity, and are associated with long-range correlations and spatial heterogeneity. The findings suggest that nonstationary patterns may play an important role in the dynamics of complex networks, and may have implications for a range of applications, including neural networks and power grids.
D2-12	Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and immune function, primarily by regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Humans can synthesize vitamin D through skin exposure to sunlight (UVB rays), but factors like limited sun exposure, darker skin, age, and geographic location can reduce production. The recommended daily intake varies by age and health status. For most adults, 600-800 IU (15-20 µg) per day is sufficient, though some individuals may require higher doses, especially if deficient. Dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and weakened immunity, making adequate vitamin D intake crucial for overall health and well-being. Regular checks can ensure optimal levels.
D1-14	Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept that matter is conserved during a reaction, meaning the quantity of reactants used equals the quantity of products formed. Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the molar ratios between substances, allowing the calculation of how much of each reactant is needed and how much product will be formed. This includes conversions between moles, mass, and volume. Stoichiometric calculations are essential for understanding reaction yields, determining the limiting reactant, and ensuring efficient use of materials in chemical processes.
3905	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes. The primary focus is to understand and identify the process that leads to moment switching in these probes and evaluate the impact of such occurrences on their overall performance. The study utilizes experimental techniques to analyze the behavior of the probes and identify the factors that influence moment switching. The critical outcomes of this research highlight the importance of moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes and provide insights into the design and optimization of the probes for various applications. The paper concludes that moment switching is a critical factor that must be considered in the design and operation of nanotube magnetic force probes, and provides recommendations for future research in this area.
3106	Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are reduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and archived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The data-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over the lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and the format of the resulting calibrated data files.
1108	Noise, corruptions and variations in face images can seriously hurt the performance of face recognition systems. To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.
1921	This research paper explores the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and its impact on the scaling relations in galaxy clusters. The paper reviews previous studies and models, examining the various observational biases that affect SZ profiles and scaling relations. The authors present new simulations that take into account these effects and demonstrate how they can significantly impact the analysis of SZ data. The findings suggest that careful consideration of these observational biases is critical to accurately interpreting SZ profiles and scaling relations in galaxy clusters. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research to improve the accuracy of SZ data analysis.
620	Controlled Lagrangian and matching techniques are developed for the stabilization of relative equilibria and equilibria of discrete mechanical systems with symmetry as well as broken symmetry. Interesting new phenomena arise in the controlled Lagrangian approach in the discrete context that are not present in the continuous theory. In particular, to make the discrete theory effective, one can make an appropriate selection of momentum levels or, alternatively, introduce a new parameter into the controlled Lagrangian to complete the kinetic matching procedure. Specifically, new terms in the controlled shape equation that are necessary for potential matching in the discrete setting are introduced. The theory is illustrated with the problem of stabilization of the cart-pendulum system on an incline. The paper also discusses digital and model predictive controllers.
212	There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the issue of whether it is possible for a single photon to exhibit nonlocality. A number of schemes have been proposed that claim to demonstrate this effect, but each has been met with significant opposition. The objections hinge largely on the fact that these schemes use unobservable initial states and so, it is claimed, they do not represent experiments that could actually be performed. Here we show how it is possible to overcome these objections by presenting an experimentally feasible scheme that uses realistic initial states. Furthermore, all the techniques required for photons are equally applicable to atoms. It should, therefore, also be possible to use this scheme to verify the nonlocality of a single massive particle.
3877	"The research paper titled ""HI velocity dispersion in NGC 1058"" explores the gas kinematics and dynamics of the galaxy NGC 1058. Using data obtained from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the study investigates the HI velocity dispersion of the galaxy and its relationship with the galactic structure and environment. The results reveal a complex velocity structure that suggests the presence of multiple gas components within the galaxy. The study also highlights the importance of incorporating HI velocity dispersion measurements in understanding the complex dynamics of galaxies. The research concludes that further investigation is necessary to fully understand the gas kinematics in NGC 1058 and its implications for galaxy evolution."
2992	We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
1773	"The research paper titled ""Transition on the entropic elasticity of DNA induced by intercalating molecules"" investigates the effect of intercalating molecules on the entropic elasticity of DNA. The study utilized single-molecule stretching experiments and statistical mechanics analysis to show that intercalation induces a transition in the entropic elasticity of DNA. The results indicate that the intercalation of molecules alters the conformational entropy of DNA and affects its mechanical properties. The findings of the study have implications for the design and development of intercalating molecules for use in DNA-based technologies. Overall, the research provides insights into the fundamental nature of DNA mechanics and the role of intercalation in modulating its properties."
3483	"The research paper titled ""Simulation via Direct Computation of Partition Functions"" explores the use of Monte Carlo simulation to calculate partition functions, which are important in statistical physics and chemistry. The authors propose a new method, called the direct calculation method, which eliminates the need for importance sampling and provides accurate results for large systems. The key finding of the study is that the direct calculation method can be used to efficiently calculate partition functions for systems of various sizes and complexities. The authors conclude that this method has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations in the field of statistical physics."
1371	We report the observation of a compensation point in the temperature dependence of magnetization data of polycrystalline Sm2Al. Magnetization measurements show that this compound magnetically orders at about 150 K. Below this temperature, the magnetization data shows a compensation point, which shifts with field. Hysteresis loops obtained below the compensation temperature show that the compound possesses exchange anisotropy. Both the exchange anisotropy field and the coercive field are found to be quite large and comparable to those of the classical spin-orbit compensated ferromagnet (Sm,Gd)Al2. The heat capacity data also suggest that there are similarities between (Sm,Gd)Al2 and Sm2Al.
1907	The research paper explores the behavior of cosmological singularities in spatially-homogeneous models with a cosmological constant. The study focuses on isotropic singularities, which are characterized by the collapse of the universe to a point of infinite density. The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the conditions that lead to isotropic singularities in these models and investigates the effect of a cosmological constant on the singularity behavior. The crucial results of the study suggest that the presence of a cosmological constant can delay or prevent the onset of isotropic singularities, leading to a more stable and predictable universe. The paper concludes that further research is needed to fully understand the role of the cosmological constant in the behavior of cosmological singularities.
D2-87	Join any group of distance educators today and the chances are you will hear talk of exponential expansion of distance education when the information superhighways come into being, within a decade. This might be called the Big Bang theory of distance education. You will hear enthusiastic talk about two-way communication (at last) between teacher and student, replacing the old one-way systems of print, radio and television. At last, students everywhere will be able to explore massive knowledge stores. You may also hear gloomy comments about limited access, costs and the dangers of technological determinism. You may even hear critics who seriously decry the commodification of knowledge represented by distance education.
1023	This research paper utilizes Quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the ring-shaped polariton parametric luminescence in a semiconductor microcavity. The study aims to understand the underlying physics of the phenomenon and to identify the key parameters that affect the emission characteristics. The results of the simulations reveal the dependence of the emission spectrum on the pump power and the cavity detuning, indicating the possibility of tuning the emission properties for potential applications in quantum information processing and communication. This work provides new insights into the physics of polariton parametric luminescence and paves the way for future experimental investigations.
3706	This research paper explores the philosophical question of why there is something rather than nothing. Through an examination of metaphysical theories and scientific evidence, the paper argues that the existence of something can be explained through the principles of causation and contingency. The paper also considers the implications of this question for our understanding of reality and the universe. Ultimately, the research concludes that the question of why there is something rather than nothing may never be fully answered, but that ongoing inquiry and exploration are essential to our understanding of the world around us.
2676	We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion. The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of approximating this functional significantly.
2062	The concept of parity in particle physics has been a topic of interest for many years. Parity is a fundamental property of particles that describes how they behave under mirror reflection. In this research paper, we explore the phenomenon of parity doubling in particle physics. Parity doubling is a theory that suggests that particles can exist in pairs, where one particle has positive parity and the other has negative parity. We analyze data from particle colliders to investigate whether this theory is supported by experimental evidence. Our results suggest that parity doubling may indeed be present in some particles, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential applications of parity doubling in particle physics.
2970	We report observation of spin-orbit Berry's phase in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type oscillation of weak field magnetoresistance in an anti-dot lattice (ADL) of a two-dimensional hole system. An AB-type oscillation is superposed on the commensurability peak, and the main peak in the Fourier transform is clearly split up due to variation in Berry's phase originating from the spin-orbit interaction. A simulation considering Berry's phase and the phase arising from the spin-orbit shift in the momentum space shows qualitative agreement with the experiment.
3024	This research paper investigates the stability of a finite volume scheme for simulating incompressible fluids. The central focus is on the stability properties of the scheme, and the paper presents a thorough analysis of the numerical stability condition. The results show that the scheme is unconditionally stable, which is a significant outcome for the simulation of incompressible fluids. The paper concludes that the finite volume scheme is a reliable and accurate method for simulating incompressible fluids, and can be used to model a range of physical phenomena, including fluid flow and heat transfer.
2677	This research paper focuses on the application of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the momentum distributions of non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) in strong laser fields. Specifically, the product phase approximation is utilized to calculate the momentum distributions of the two electrons that are ionized simultaneously. The results suggest that the product phase approximation can accurately capture the NSDI momentum distributions and that the momentum correlations between the two electrons play a crucial role in shaping the distributions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the NSDI process and highlights the importance of considering electron-electron correlations in TDDFT calculations.
188	This paper proposes a novel algorithm for finding error-locators of algebraic-geometric codes that can eliminate the division-calculations of finite fields from the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm. This inverse-free algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors, generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic curves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to, and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each clock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for codes on algebraic curves.
321	"We propose a new algorithm to the problem of polygonal curve approximation based on a multiresolution approach. This algorithm is suboptimal but still maintains some optimality between successive levels of resolution using dynamic programming. We show theoretically and experimentally that this algorithm has a linear complexity in time and space. We experimentally compare the outcomes of our algorithm to the optimal ""full search"" dynamic programming solution and finally to classical merge and split approaches. The experimental evaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either show a lower time complexity or provide polygonal approximations closer to the input discrete curves."
1835	We experimentally study the fluid flow induced by a broad, penetrable barrier moving through an elongated dilute gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate. The barrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the resulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. We examine both cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: At slow speeds of the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the condensate. At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which the condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton formation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the condensate is seen again.
2756	"The research paper ""Measuring two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement"" discusses the measurement of entanglement between two photons with orbital angular momentum. The main theme is to explore the use of a holographic technique to measure the entanglement of photons with different orbital angular momentum states. The paper presents experimental results that show a clear correlation between the entanglement of the photons and the phase shift of the hologram. The conclusion drawn from the research is that the holographic technique provides a reliable method to measure the entanglement of photons with different orbital angular momentum states, which has important implications for quantum communication and quantum computing."
1678	The core of the vortex in the Neel order parameter for an easy-plane antiferromagnet on honeycomb lattice is demonstrated to bind two zero-energy states. Remarkably, a single electron occupying this mid-gap band has its spin fragmented between the two sublattices: Whereas it yields a vanishing total magnetization it shows a finite Neel order, orthogonal to the one of the assumed background. The requisite easy-plane anisotropy may be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer, for example. The results are relevant for spin-1/2 fermions on graphene's or optical honeycomb lattice, in the strongly interacting regime.
3164	Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.
764	This research paper explores the application of nonholonomic algebroids, Finsler geometry, and Lagrange-Hamilton spaces in the field of mathematics. The main theme of this study is to investigate the relationship between these three mathematical structures and their role in understanding the dynamics of nonholonomic systems. The research analyzes the mathematical foundations of these structures and their application in various nonholonomic systems. The critical outcomes of this study include the development of new algorithms for solving nonholonomic systems and the establishment of a framework for understanding the relationship between these structures. Overall, this research provides critical insights into the use of nonholonomic algebroids, Finsler geometry, and Lagrange-Hamilton spaces in understanding the dynamics of nonholonomic systems and lays the foundation for future research in this field.
1659	Deformation Theory is a natural generalization of Lie Theory, from Lie groups and their linearization, Lie algebras, to differential graded Lie algebras and their higher order deformations, quantum groups. The article focuses on two basic constructions of deformation theory: the universal solution of Maurer-Cartan Equation (MCE), which plays the role of the exponential of Lie Theory, and its inverse, the Kuranishi functor, as the logarithm. The deformation functor is the gauge reduction of MCE, corresponding to a Hodge decomposition associated to the strong deformation retract data. The above comparison with Lie Theory leads to a better understanding of Deformation Theory and its applications, e.g. the relation between quantization and Connes-Kreimer renormalization, quantum doubles and Birkhoff decomposition.
3496	"We study the dynamics of initial nucleation processes of photoinduced structural change of molecular crystals. In order to describe the nonadiabatic transition in each molecule, we employ a model of localized electrons coupled with a fully quantized phonon mode, and the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for the model is numerically solved. We found a minimal model to describe the nucleation induced by injection of an excited state of a single molecule in which multiple types of intermolecular interactions are required. In this model coherently driven molecular distortion plays an important role in the successive conversion of electronic states which leads to photoinduced cooperative phenomena."
3309	We take into account the constraints from the observed extragalactic gamma-ray background to estimate the maximum duty cycle allowed for a selected sample of WMAP Blazars, in order to be detectable by AGILE and GLAST gamma-ray experiments. For the nominal sensitivity values of both instruments, we identify a subset of sources which can in principle be detectable also in a steady state without over-predicting the extragalactic background. This work is based on the results of a recently derived Blazar radio LogN-LogS obtained by combining several multi-frequency surveys.
3003	We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well trap.
1336	This research paper focuses on studying the scattering of waves by small impedance particles in a medium. The study uses the boundary element method to analyze the scattering process and to investigate the effects of particle size and composition on the scattered field. The main outcome of the study is the observation of resonance peaks in the scattered field, which are dependent on the size and composition of the particles. The conclusions of the study provide insights into the behavior of waves in heterogeneous media and have potential applications in fields such as medical imaging and geophysics.
2163	The research paper focuses on assessing and propagating the impact of input uncertainty in tree-based option pricing models. The paper introduces a new method for assessing uncertainty in option pricing models that uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate a distribution of possible option prices. The results of the study show that input uncertainty can have a significant impact on option prices and that the proposed method can effectively capture and propagate this uncertainty. The paper also discusses the importance of considering input uncertainty when making investment decisions and highlights the potential benefits of using tree-based option pricing models in this context. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the impact of input uncertainty on option pricing models and offers a new approach for assessing and propagating this uncertainty in tree-based models.
1380	This research paper provides an overview of the current status of Japanese detectors, including their development, performance, and applications. The paper discusses several types of detectors, such as semiconductor detectors, gas detectors, and scintillation detectors, and their use in various fields such as particle physics, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring. The authors also highlight the significant progress made in the development of new detector technologies, particularly in the areas of radiation hardness, spatial resolution, and energy resolution. Finally, the paper identifies future research directions and challenges, emphasizing the need for continued investment in detector R&D to meet the evolving needs of science and society.
800	This research paper presents a new method for calculating the beta function of large-N QCD_4 using the holographic loop equation. The authors derive an exact expression for the beta function, which describes how the coupling constant of the theory changes as a function of energy scale. The results suggest that the beta function has a non-trivial fixed point, which is important for understanding the behavior of the theory at high energies. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for the holographic duality between gravity and QCD_4. Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to our understanding of large-N QCD_4 and its holographic dual.
3560	The period map for cubic fourfolds takes values in a locally symmetric variety of orthogonal type of dimension 20. We determine the image of this period map (thus confirming a conjecture of Hassett) and give at the same time a new proof of the theorem of Voisin that asserts that this period map is an open embedding. An algebraic version of our main result is an identification of the algebra of SL(6)-invariant polynomials on the space of cubic forms in 6 complex variables with a certain algebra of meromorphic automorphic forms on a symmetric domain of orthogonal type of dimension 20. We also describe the stratification of the moduli space of semistable cubic fourfolds in terms of a Dynkin-Vinberg diagram.
539	Proposed by Wolfgang Pauli more than 80 years ago, the exclusion principle has been proven to have a far-reaching consequence, from femtoscopic world to macroscopic, super-dense, and fully relativistic physics. Starting from this principle, we discuss two interesting research topics, which have currently drawn considerable attention in the nuclear- and astrophysics communities; the hypernuclear and neutron star physics. Special attention is given to the electromagnetic production of the hypertriton and the consequences of the neutrino electromagnetic properties in dense matter. We also touch on the new arena which could also be fascinating for physicists; the econophysics.
1690	The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and discussed from several different perspectives: (i) stability of motion against external perturbations and decoherence, (ii) efficiency of quantum simulation in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator spaces, (iii) quantum transport, relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing, and (iv) computation of quantum dynamical entropies. Discussions of all these criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or quantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some conjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many problem are suggested.
1425	We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.
5	This research paper investigates the percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation, which refers to the relationship between the degrees of the nodes in a network. The authors use numerical simulations to study the behavior of percolation on networks with varying degrees of correlation. The results show that degree-degree correlation can significantly affect the percolation transition, and that networks with positive correlation tend to have a higher percolation threshold than those with negative correlation. The research has important implications for understanding the resilience of real-world networks, such as social networks and transportation networks, to failures and attacks.
1419	Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), being capable of beating PNS attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently. But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit error rate (QBER) increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility (99%) long period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom (1550 nm) wavelength. This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity protocol.
216	Optimal delay-throughput trade-offs for two-dimensional i.i.d mobility models have been established in [23], where we showed that the optimal trade-offs can be achieved using rate-less codes when the required delay guarantees are sufficient large. In this paper, we extend the results to other mobility models including two-dimensional hybrid random walk model, one-dimensional i.i.d. mobility model and one-dimensional hybrid random walk model. We consider both fast mobiles and slow mobiles, and establish the optimal delay-throughput trade-offs under some conditions. Joint coding-scheduling algorithms are also proposed to achieve the optimal trade-offs.
3537	Protein folding is a complex process that is critical for the proper functioning of biological systems. Understanding the network structure of protein folding pathways can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying this process. In this paper, we review recent advances in the field of protein folding and explore the network structure of folding pathways. We examine the role of network motifs, community structure, and other network properties in shaping folding pathways. Additionally, we discuss the implications of network structure for protein design and engineering, as well as potential applications in drug discovery. Our findings suggest that a network-based approach can provide a powerful framework for understanding protein folding and its role in biological systems.
1594	The paper describes the potential applications of wavelet analysis on the sphere in the field of cosmology. The authors explain that wavelet analysis can be used to study the distribution of matter and radiation in the universe, as well as the properties of the cosmic microwave background. They also discuss how wavelet analysis can be used to study the large-scale structure of the universe, including the detection of galaxy clusters and the measurement of their masses. The authors conclude that wavelet analysis on the sphere has great potential for advancing our understanding of the universe and its evolution. Noteworthy outcomes include the identification of new galaxy clusters and the potential for more accurate measurements of their masses.
3606	Although there is mounting observational evidence that the cosmic expansion is undergoing a late-time acceleration, the physical mechanism behind such a phenomenon is yet unknown. In this paper, we investigate a holographic dark energy (HDE) model with interaction between the components of the dark sector in the light of current cosmological observations. We use both the new \emph{gold} sample of 182 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the 192 SNe Ia ESSENCE data, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the shift parameter from the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. In agreement with previous results, we show that these observations suggest a very weak coupling or even a noninteracting HDE. The phantom crossing behavior in the context of these scenarios is also briefly discussed.
D2-8	Fossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked Protoceratops skulls were common as fossils. A later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals.  He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations,  which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxon.
3002	This research paper explores the dependence of the critical adsorption point for self-avoiding walks on surface and sequence disorders when interacting with a planar surface. Various simulation techniques were used to study the effects of surface and sequence disorders on the adsorption behavior of self-avoiding walks. The results indicate that the critical adsorption point is influenced by the degree of surface and sequence disorders. The study provides insights into the adsorption behavior of self-avoiding walks and can be useful in various fields such as polymer physics and biophysics.
2902	Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinear optical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has the potential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics in semiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best be understood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates. However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated by solving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result in a quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressions for the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directions and use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formal connection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons (soft-core bosons) is pointed out.
562	We present two theoretical schemes for spin filters in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as well as weak magnetic potential. For case I, the SOC is periodic and the weak magnetic potential is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy intervals. For case II, the weak magnetic potential is periodic while the SOC is uniform. An ideal negative/positive switching effect for spin polarization is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, magnetic potential, and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed.
2058	This research paper revisits the Fischler-Susskind holographic cosmology model, which suggests that the universe's evolution can be described as a hologram projected from its boundary. By analyzing the model's physical implications and comparing it with observational data, the authors find that it provides a plausible explanation for various cosmological phenomena, including the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, they also identify some limitations of the model, such as its inability to explain the origin of the holographic principle. Overall, the paper contributes to our understanding of the holographic universe hypothesis and its implications for cosmology.
2717	The study focuses on using X-ray observations to investigate the properties of Compact Extragalactic Radio Jets (CERJs) in the MOJAVE sample. The researchers analyzed data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and found that the X-ray emission from the CERJs is consistent with synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons. They also found evidence of X-ray emission from the hotspots of some CERJs, which suggests that the hotspots are sites of particle acceleration. The study provides important insights into the physical processes occurring in CERJs and highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations in studying these objects.
1910	The following question is addressed: under what conditions can a strange diffusive process, defined by a semi-dynamical V-Langevin equation or its associated Hybrid kinetic equation (HKE), be described by an equivalent purely stochastic process, defined by a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or by a Fractional Differential Equation (FDE)? More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived.
958	Web page ranking and collaborative filtering require the optimization of sophisticated performance measures. Current Support Vector approaches are unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem, which can be solved by the Hungarian Marriage algorithm. At test time, a sort operation is sufficient, as our algorithm assigns a relevance score to every (document, query) pair. Experiments show that the our algorithm is fast and that it works very well.
1672	In a series of recent papers, a new formalism has been developed that explains the inner structure of dark matter halos as collisionless, dissipationless systems assembled through mergers and accretion at the typical cosmological rate. Nearby ellipticals are also collisionless, dissipationless systems assembling their mass through mergers, but contrarily to the former structures they do not continuously accrete external matter because they are shielded by their host halos. Here we explore the idea that the infall of their own matter ejected within the halo on the occasion of a violent merger can play a role similar to external accretion in halos. The predicted stellar mass density profile fits the observed one, and the empirical total mass density profile is also recovered.
1022	We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum correlations in the parametric luminescence from semiconductor microcavities in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime. As already demonstrated in recent experiments, a ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the signal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold, accounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and static disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo simulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.
2274	A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion processes is presented. No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is assumed. The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more advanced methods and problems.
1446	We prove John Hubbard's conjecture on the topological complexity of the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map. Indeed, we show that there exist several non-trivial loops in the locus which generate infinitely many mutually different monodromies. Our main tool is a rigorous computational algorithm for verifying the uniform hyperbolicity of chain recurrent sets. In addition, we show that the dynamics of the real H\'enon map is completely determined by the monodromy of a certain loop, providing the parameter of the map is contained in the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map.
1685	The paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of a particle system with degenerate rates, which is a common model for many physical and biological processes. The authors derive the hydrodynamic limit of the system, which describes the behavior of the macroscopic variables such as density and velocity in the limit of large number of particles. They show that the hydrodynamic equations can be obtained as a limit of the particle system and prove the convergence of the solutions. Moreover, they establish the uniqueness of the hydrodynamic limit and characterize the stability of the system. These results have significant implications in the study of various phenomena such as traffic flow, crowd dynamics, and chemical reactions.
2128	This research paper explores the concept of de Broglie's quantum particle as the soliton solution of linear Schr dinger equation. The main objective is to investigate the relationship between the two theories and to determine if the soliton solution can offer a better understanding of the quantum particle. The paper examines the mathematical framework of both theories and highlights the similarities and differences. The noteworthy outcome of the study is the finding that the soliton solution can provide a new perspective on the behavior of the quantum particle. The research concludes by suggesting further exploration of this approach to gain a deeper understanding of the quantum world.
998	The harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short, intense infrared laser pulses is analyzed by means of particle-in-cell simulations. A pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.
2860	The hyperfine structure of highly-charged ions is investigated using laser spectroscopy, aiming to test the validity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in high fields. Theoretical predictions suggest deviations from QED at high fields, making this a key test for the theory. The experimental setup involves the use of a high-resolution laser to excite transitions between hyperfine states in the ions, with measurements taken to determine the energy levels and the strength of the hyperfine interaction. The results are compared with QED predictions, and any deviations from the theory are analyzed. This research provides important insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions and could have implications for fundamental physics and technology applications.
1652	This research paper investigates the Comptonization process and its effect on the spectra of accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. The study utilizes data from multiple X-ray observatories and analyzes the spectral properties of several pulsars. The results show that Comptonization plays a crucial role in shaping the spectra of these pulsars, with evidence of both thermal and non-thermal Comptonization processes. The findings also suggest that the magnetic field strength and the accretion rate are important factors in determining the spectral properties of X-ray pulsars. Overall, this study provides important insights into the physics of accretion-powered X-ray pulsars and the Comptonization process.
1166	The expansion rate of `Intermediate inflation' lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution. Present study of `Intermediate inflation' reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution, leading to late time acceleration. The corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some non-canonical form of kinetic term. Thus the so called Intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic de-Sitter expansion.
3569	This research paper explores the concept of isotropic sets of points in the plane and their potential application to the design of robot architectures. Isotropic sets of points refer to a collection of points that exhibit symmetry and uniformity in all directions. The paper investigates the properties and characteristics of isotropic sets and proposes their use in designing robot architectures that can move and operate efficiently in any direction. The study includes mathematical analyses and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of isotropic sets in improving robot mobility and performance. The findings of this research can have significant implications in the field of robotics, particularly in the development of robots that can navigate complex environments with ease.
3544	The use of off-resonant standing light waves to manipulate ultracold atoms is investigated. Previous work has illustrated that optical pulses can provide efficient beam-splitting and reflection operations for atomic wave packets. The performance of these operations is characterized experimentally using Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a weak magnetic trap. Under optimum conditions, fidelities of up to 0.99 for beam splitting and 0.98 for reflection are observed, and splitting operations of up to third order are achieved. The dependence of the operations on light intensity and atomic velocity is measured and found to agree well with theoretical estimates.
D2-100	It is an approximation useful in chemistry, but not strictly correct. It is not, in general, obeyed by nuclear reactions, or even in one common medical procedure, PET scanning (positron emission tomography). In this procedure, radioactive variants of common drug or body chemicals are injected into a patient under observation. Some of a particular radioactive chemical element or elements are radioactive in a particular way—they are neutron-light. Their nuclear reactions in the body are similar to beta-decay of neutron-heavy elements, except that the “electrons” released are not electrons, but the corresponding anti-matter: positrons. As anti-matter, positrons are quite unwelcome in ordinary matter—the patient—and very quickly encounter electrons, annihilating each electron-positron pair.
1611	This research paper investigates the justification of the coupled-mode approximation for a nonlinear elliptic problem with a periodic potential. The coupled-mode approximation is a commonly used method for approximating solutions to nonlinear problems in physics and engineering. However, its validity for nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the coupled-mode approximation in this particular context. Our results show that the coupled-mode approximation is a reliable method for approximating solutions to nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials, and can be used in a wide range of applications in physics and engineering.
4044	This research paper provides an update on the progress made in the scalar potential model, which is a theoretical framework used to explain the origin and properties of scalar fields. The main focus of the paper is on recent advancements in understanding the behavior of scalar fields in different physical contexts, such as cosmology and particle physics. The paper highlights crucial findings, including the discovery of new scalar particles and the development of new techniques for calculating scalar field interactions. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research in the field.
3865	This research paper explores the correlation between supernova polarization and the Type IIn classification. Using data from multiple telescopes and observations, we analyze the polarization properties of a sample of Type IIn supernovae. Our findings suggest that polarization can be a valuable tool in distinguishing between Type IIn and other types of supernovae. Additionally, we discuss the implications of this research for understanding the physical mechanisms behind supernova explosions. Overall, our study highlights the importance of polarization measurements in supernova classification and sheds light on the complex nature of these stellar events.
1137	"Taking matrix as a synonym for a numerical function on the Cartesian product of two (in general, infinite) sets, a simple purely algebraic ""reciprocity property"" says that the set of rows spans a finite-dim space iff the set of columns does so. Similar topological reciprocity properties serve to define strongly compact and weakly compact matrices, featured in the well-known basic facts about almost periodic functions and about compact operators. Some properties, especially for the weak compact case, are investigated, such as the connection with the matrix having a Fubini-like property for general means. These are applied to prove possibility of extension to the entire semigroup of bounded densely defined semigroups of operators in a Banach space with weak continuity properties."
509	It had been proposed that overstretching double stranded DNA from the 5-5 ends will produce a new fiber form of dsDNA that is narrower than the S form that has been suggested to result when the dsDNA is overstretched from the 3-3 ends. We present the first comparison of the structures that result when dsDNA is overstretched from the 5-5, 3-3, and 3-5 ends and show that the stability of the overstretched form depends on the ends to which the force is applied. The stability also depends strongly on the ionic environment as well as the presence of reagents that bind to ssDNA.
2169	This research paper aims to explore the possibility of learning more from the Lorentz transformations, which have been a cornerstone of special relativity for over a century. The paper examines the history of the transformations and their role in modern physics, as well as current research in the field. Through an analysis of various approaches to studying the Lorentz transformations, the paper argues that there is still much to be learned from this fundamental concept. The research also proposes new avenues for investigating the transformations, including the use of computational methods and experimental measurements. Ultimately, this paper provides insights into the potential for uncovering new knowledge and understanding in the field of special relativity through a deeper exploration of the Lorentz transformations.
386	Inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the pseudoscalar mesons of QCD through a dual embedding in a strongly curved extra dimensional spacetime. This model incorporates the consequences of symmetry and has very few free parameters, due to constraints from five-dimensions and the operator product expansion of QCD. Using as inputs the pion, kaon, and rho masses and fpi, we compute the eta and eta prime masses to be 520 and 867 MeV, respectively. Their decay rates into photons are also computed and found to be in good agreement with data.
1150	Using first principles calculations, we study the microscopic origin of ferroelectricity (FE) induced by magnetic order in the orthorhombic HoMnO3. We obtain the largest ferroelectric polarization observed in the whole class of improper magnetic ferroelectrics to date. We find that the two proposed mechanisms for FE in multiferroics, lattice- and electronic-based, are simultaneously active in this compound: a large portion of the ferroelectric polarization arises due to quantum-mechanical effects of electron orbital polarization, in addition to the conventional polar atomic displacements. An interesting mechanism for switching the magnetoelectric domains by an electric field via a 180-degree coherent rotation of Mn spins is also proposed.
1388	This research paper examines the evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, specifically in relation to biodiversity cycles. The concept of biodiversity cycles suggests that there are regular, predictable patterns in the rise and fall of species diversity over time, and that these patterns may be linked to astronomical and/or geological cycles. This paper reexamines the evidence for biodiversity cycles, drawing on recent developments in paleontological and statistical methods. The results suggest that while there is some evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, the case for biodiversity cycles is far from conclusive. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this area, and by identifying some of the key challenges and opportunities for future work.
165	Microfabrication of graphene devices used in many experimental studies currently relies on the fact that graphene crystallites can be visualized using optical microscopy if prepared on top of silicon wafers with a certain thickness of silicon dioxide. We study graphene's visibility and show that it depends strongly on both thickness of silicon dioxide and light wavelength. We have found that by using monochromatic illumination, graphene can be isolated for any silicon dioxide thickness, albeit 300 nm (the current standard) and, especially, approx. 100 nm are most suitable for its visual detection. By using a Fresnel-law-based model, we quantitatively describe the experimental data without any fitting parameters.
3938	This research paper aims to investigate the torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops, which are important features of the solar corona. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the effects of longitudinal inhomogeneity on the oscillation behavior of coronal loops. The results show that the presence of longitudinal inhomogeneity significantly alters the oscillation frequency and damping rate of the loops. Additionally, it is observed that the amplitude of the oscillations is influenced by the degree of inhomogeneity. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of observations of coronal loop oscillations and contribute to our understanding of the physical processes at work in the solar corona.
2545	A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization. Relations between symmetries of this theory and the O(d,d) symmetry of the string-inspired models are discussed.
1114	We proved that under quantum mechanics a momentum-energy and a space-time are dual vector spaces on an almost complex manifold in position representation, and the minimal uncertainty relations are equivalent to the inner-product relations of their bases. In a microscopic sense, there exist locally a momentum-energy conservation and a space-time conservation. The minimal uncertainty relations refer to a local equilibrium state for a stable system, and the relations will be invariable in the special relativity. A supposition about something having dark property is proposed, which relates to a breakdown of time symmetry.
1374	The long-ranged elastic model, which is believed to describe the evolution of a self-affine rough crack-front, is analyzed to linear and non-linear orders. It is shown that the nonlinear terms, while important in changing the front dynamics, are not changing the scaling exponent which characterizes the roughness of the front. The scaling exponent thus predicted by the model is much smaller than the one observed experimentally. The inevitable conclusion is that the gap between the results of experiments and the model that is supposed to describe them is too large, and some new physics has to be invoked for another model.
2244	We present an atomistic three-dimensional simulation of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNR-FETs), based on the self-consistent solution of the 3D Poisson and Schroedinger equation with open boundary conditions within the non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism and a tight-binding hamiltonian. With respect to carbon nanotube FETs, GNR-FETs exhibit comparable performance, reduced sensitivity on the variability of channel chirality, and similar leakage problems due to band-to-band tunneling. Acceptable transistor performance requires effective nanoribbon width of 1-2 nm, that could be obtained with periodic etching patterns or stress patterns.
3852	We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.
2789	"Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices."
912	Consider a collection of random variables attached to the vertices of a graph. The reconstruction problem requires to estimate one of them given `far away' observations. Several theoretical results (and simple algorithms) are available when their joint probability distribution is Markov with respect to a tree. In this paper we consider the case of sequences of random graphs that converge locally to trees. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for the tree and graph reconstruction problem to coincide. We apply such condition to colorings of random graphs. Further, we characterize the behavior of Ising models on such graphs, both with attractive and random interactions (respectively, `ferromagnetic' and `spin glass').
1837	We present imaging data and photometry for the COSMOS survey in 15 photometric bands between 0.3um and 2.4um. These include data taken on the Subaru 8.3m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes, and the CFHT 3.6m telescope. Special techniques are used to ensure that the relative photometric calibration is better than 1% across the field of view. The absolute photometric accuracy from standard star measurements is found to be 6%. The absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors accurate to 2% or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with the expected values. Finally, as the first step in the scientific analysis of these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving.
234	This research paper investigates the angular momentum transport in accretion disks, specifically focusing on the scaling laws in magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulence. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the behavior of accretion disks and their ability to transport angular momentum. The findings suggest that the MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks follows a universal scaling law, which can be used to accurately predict the transport of angular momentum in these systems. This research provides a better understanding of the fundamental processes that drive accretion disks and may have implications for the study of black holes and other astrophysical phenomena.
1745	The PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) study is a large-scale MRI experiment designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac MRI for the evaluation of patients with chest pain. However, the spiral MRI acquisition used in PROMISE is susceptible to boundary effects, which can compromise image quality and accuracy. In this research paper, we propose a novel method for reducing boundary effects in spiral MRI using an adaptive data-driven approach. Our results demonstrate that this method significantly improves image quality and reduces the impact of boundary effects on diagnostic accuracy in the PROMISE study. This approach has the potential to enhance the reliability and clinical value of spiral MRI in the evaluation of patients with chest pain.
425	A scheme for coherent manipulation of collective atomic states is developed such that total subradiant states, in which spontaneous emission is suppressed into all directions due to destructive interference between neighbor atoms, can be created in an extended atomic ensemble. The optimal conditions for creation of such states and suitability of them for quantum storage are discussed. It is shown that in order to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio the shape of a light pulse to be stored and reconstructed using a homogeneously broadened absorbtion line of an atomic system should be a time-reversed regular part of the response function of the system. In the limit of high optical density, such pulses allow one to prepare collective subradiant atomic states with near flat spatial distribution of the atomic excitation in the medium.
1859	We study Markov processes associated with stochastic differential equations, whose non-linearities are gradients of convex functionals. We prove a general result of existence of such Markov processes and a priori estimates on the transition probabilities. The main result is the following stability property: if the associated invariant measures converge weakly, then the Markov processes converge in law. The proofs are based on the interpretation of a Fokker-Planck equation as the steepest descent flow of the relative Entropy functional in the space of probability measures, endowed with the Wasserstein distance. Applications include stochastic partial differential equations and convergence of equilibrium fluctuations for a class of random interfaces.
1400	This research paper investigates the concept of well-gradedness in a union-closed family and proposes a method for verifying and engineering this property. The study shows that the well-gradedness property can be used to identify optimal solutions in various scenarios, including voting systems and facility location problems. The proposed method utilizes a graph-theoretic approach and computational tools to efficiently verify and engineer well-gradedness. The results indicate that the method is effective and provides practical benefits for decision-making processes. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding and application of well-gradedness in union-closed families and provides a useful tool for decision-makers in various fields.
3058	A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.
164	This research paper investigates the possibility of tuning Kondo physics in graphene through gate voltage manipulation. Kondo physics refers to the interaction between magnetic impurities and conduction electrons in a material, leading to the formation of a many-body state. Graphene, a two-dimensional material, has been shown to exhibit Kondo physics with magnetic impurities. However, the effect of gate voltage on Kondo physics in graphene remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques to investigate how gate voltage affects Kondo physics in graphene. Our results show that gate voltage can be used to tune Kondo physics in graphene, with the strength of the Kondo effect increasing with increasing gate voltage. This study provides valuable insights into the potential use of graphene in spintronics and quantum computing applications.
299	This research paper focuses on various approaches for predicting land cover in mountain areas. The study aims to identify the best approaches for obtaining accurate predictions of land cover in mountainous regions. The paper reviews and compares different methods, including machine learning algorithms, remote sensing techniques, and statistical models. The study found that combining remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms provided the most accurate results. The research results have significant implications for land use planning and natural resource management in mountain areas. Accurate land cover predictions are necessary for effective decision-making and conservation efforts.
2709	This research paper presents the ground-based direct detection of exoplanets using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). The GPI is an advanced instrument designed for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets. The paper discusses the GPI's capabilities and how it has been used to detect and characterize exoplanets. The study also highlights the challenges and limitations of ground-based direct detection and how the GPI is addressing these issues. Overall, this research paper provides important insights into the feasibility and potential of ground-based direct detection of exoplanets using the GPI.
3588	Special solutions of string theory in supercritical dimensions can interpolate in time between theories with different numbers of spacetime dimensions (via dimension quenching) and different amounts of worldsheet supersymmetry (via c-duality). These solutions connect supercritical string theories to the more familiar string duality web in ten dimensions, and provide a precise link between supersymmetric and purely bosonic string theories. Dimension quenching and c-duality appear to be natural concepts in string theory, giving rise to large networks of interconnected theories. We describe some of these networks in detail and discuss general consistency constraints on the types of transitions that arise in this framework.
892	Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a (modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the implications for faster-than light travel.
1840	This research paper presents a study on the thermodynamic properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) superconductor, which is highly desirable for various technological applications. The electronic dispersion of BSCCO was calculated using a first-principles approach to obtain the band structure. Based on the electronic dispersion, various thermodynamic properties were calculated, including the specific heat, entropy, and free energy. The results show that the specific heat and entropy of BSCCO are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, the calculated free energy provides valuable information on the stability of the superconducting state. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of BSCCO and enhance the potential for its use in various technological applications.
1274	We present the results of six-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 3C~66A. The high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) maps obtained at multi-frequency (2.3, 8.4, and 22.2 GHz) simultaneously enabled us to identify the brightest compact component with the core. We find that the spectrum of the core can be reasonably fitted by the synchrotron self-absorption model. Our VLBA maps show that the jet of 3C~66A has two bendings at about 1.2 and 4 mas from the core. We also give possible identifications of our jet components with the components in previous VLBA observations by analysing their proper motions. We find consistent differences of the position from the core in one component between different frequencies at six epochs.
1034	We consider a model for periodic patterns of charges constrained over a cylindrical surface. In particular we focus on patterns of chiral helices, achiral rings or vertical lamellae, with the constraint of global electroneutrality. We study the dependence of the patterns' size and pitch angle on the radius of the cylinder and salt concentration. We obtain a phase diagram by using numerical and analytic techniques. For pure Coulomb interactions, we find a ring phase for small radii and a chiral helical phase for large radii. At a critical salt concentration, the characteristic domain size diverges, resulting in macroscopic phase segregation of the components and restoring chiral symmetry. We discuss possible consequences and generalizations of our model.
2984	We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
3611	This research paper aims to investigate the tracking of user attention in collaborative tagging communities. Collaborative tagging is a process where users collectively assign tags to content, such as images or web pages, to organize and classify them. The focus of this study is to explore how user attention can be monitored and analyzed in these communities, specifically examining the factors that influence user attention and the impact of user attention on the quality of tagging and user engagement. The research will employ a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The findings of this research will contribute to the understanding of user behavior and engagement in collaborative tagging communities and inform the development of tools to improve the effectiveness of tagging systems.
777	We formulate a general super duality conjecture on connections between parabolic categories O of modules over Lie superalgebras and Lie algebras of type A, based on a Fock space formalism of their Kazhdan-Lusztig theories which was initiated by Brundan. We show that the Brundan-Kazhdan-Lusztig (BKL) polynomials for Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) in our parabolic setup can be identified with the usual parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. We establish some special cases of the BKL conjecture on the parabolic category O of gl(m|n)-modules and additional results which support the BKL conjecture and super duality conjecture.
2948	Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.
365	"The research paper titled ""Particle-based modeling of oxygen discharges"" presents a computational model for simulating the behavior of oxygen discharges. The authors use a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method to simulate the interactions between charged particles and neutral molecules in an oxygen plasma. The results show that the model accurately predicts the electrical and chemical properties of the plasma, as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma species. The paper also discusses the effects of various parameters, such as the gas pressure and power input, on the plasma behavior. The authors conclude that their model can provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of oxygen plasma discharges, which could have important applications in fields such as materials processing and plasma medicine."
3123	We explore the conductance of self-healing materials as a measure of the material integrity in the regime of the onset of the initial fatigue. Continuum effective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported. Our results illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onset of the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-like time-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damage regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality degradation.
988	This article presents a model of general-purpose computing on a semantic network substrate. The concepts presented are applicable to any semantic network representation. However, due to the standards and technological infrastructure devoted to the Semantic Web effort, this article is presented from this point of view. In the proposed model of computing, the application programming interface, the run-time program, and the state of the computing virtual machine are all represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The implementation of the concepts presented provides a practical computing paradigm that leverages the highly-distributed and standardized representational-layer of the Semantic Web.
975	This research paper examines the flow of autonomous traffic on a single multi-lane street.

552	The research paper explores the use of microfractured media with a scale and Mumford-Shah energies. The authors propose a mathematical model that is capable of describing the behavior of such media, and they also provide numerical simulations to support their findings. The study reveals that the proposed model is effective in capturing the essential features of microfractured media, and it can also be used to predict the behavior of such media under different conditions. The research concludes that the proposed model has the potential to be a useful tool for studying microfractured media in a variety of applications.
798	This research paper investigates the baryon asymmetry problem in a heavy moduli scenario. We analyze the effective potential of the Higgs field and its role in generating a non-zero baryon number. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, we demonstrate that a heavy moduli field can lead to an efficient generation of baryon number asymmetry. Our results suggest that this scenario can provide a viable solution to the baryon asymmetry problem in the early universe. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of heavy moduli fields in understanding the origin of matter in the universe.
2736	One-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels using current Internet protocols. However, the need for renewing shared secret keys make this method unpractical. This work shows how users can use a fast physical random generator based on fluctuations of a light field and the Internet channel to directly boost key renewals. The transmitted signals are deterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the attacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is achieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring numbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed. Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are determined.
2385	This research paper investigates the sensitivity of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy is a novel technique that combines the benefits of differential stereoscopy and spectral imaging to produce high-quality images with enhanced sensitivity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique by comparing it to other existing spectral imaging methods. The experimental results show that hybrid differential stereoscopy is highly sensitive and outperforms other methods in terms of image quality and spectral resolution. Therefore, it has great potential in various applications such as biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial inspection. This research provides valuable insights into the development of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging and its future applications.
3064	A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D, contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.
3633	The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator.
3932	We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.
1098	This research paper investigates the spin effects in single-electron transport through carbon nanotube quantum dots. The study utilizes a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to analyze the spin properties of the electrons. The main focus is on understanding the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the transmission properties of the quantum dots. The results suggest that spin-orbit coupling can significantly alter the transport properties of the quantum dots, leading to a spin-sensitive conductance. The study also highlights the potential use of carbon nanotube quantum dots in spintronics applications. Overall, the research provides critical insights into the spin effects in carbon nanotube quantum dots and sheds light on their potential applications in future electronic devices.
3952	A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
2730	We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.
894	This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally quantized.
2804	This research paper investigates the generation of entanglement of photon-number states using coherent light through the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. The cross-Kerr interaction has been proposed as a promising method for generating entanglement between photons in different modes. We present a theoretical analysis of the cross-Kerr interaction and propose a scheme for generating entangled photon-number states. Our results show that entanglement between photon-number states can be generated with high fidelity using this method. This research provides a novel approach for generating entangled states and has potential applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.
2383	This research paper aims to study the structural parameters of globular clusters in M31 and their relationship with the fundamental plane. The paper utilizes data from Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic observations to determine the size and luminosity of the clusters. The study finds that the globular clusters in M31 follow a similar trend as those in the Milky Way, with a correlation between size and luminosity. The study also suggests that the fundamental plane can be used to estimate the size and luminosity of globular clusters in other galaxies. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their relationship with galaxy formation.
2921	Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied. Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric fibration.
2490	This research paper explores the relationship between novelty and collective attention in social media platforms. The authors analyze a dataset of over 160 million tweets to examine how novelty affects the spread of information and the attention of users. They find that new information is more likely to attract attention and be shared, but that the impact of novelty diminishes over time. Additionally, they find that users tend to focus their attention on a small number of topics, leading to a polarization of attention. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of novelty and attention in online communities.
703	Dick Dalitz produced lasting contributions to particle physics for 50 years. Along with Dalitz pairs, Dalitz plots and CDD poles, he did major work in parity violation, hyperon resonance identification, the quark model, and hypernuclei. These topics will be summarized, with some emphasis on the author's collaboration with Dalitz on quark spin and fragmentation correlations, and, particularly, the work on the identification of the top quark and its mass. Short biographical information is interspersed. This paper is based on a presentation at the International School of Subnuclear Physics, Erice 2006.
1729	The Casimir effect is a well-known phenomenon in quantum field theory that arises due to the presence of boundary conditions in the vacuum energy of a system. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the Casimir effect on nontrivial topology spaces, particularly in the context of Krein space quantization. In this research paper, we investigate the Casimir effect on a nontrivial topology space, namely the torus, in the framework of Krein space quantization. We derive the Casimir energy density and investigate its dependence on the geometry and topology of the torus. Our results show that the Casimir energy density exhibits nontrivial behavior as a function of the torus parameters, indicating the potential for using the Casimir effect as a tool to probe the topology of nontrivial spaces in Krein space quantization.
3166	We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of gravitational energy.
3362	This research paper presents the results of an X-ray imaging study of the stellar population in RCW49, an active star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identified a total of 362 X-ray sources within the region, including a number of young, high-mass stars. Our analysis of the X-ray properties of these sources allowed us to estimate their ages, masses, and other physical characteristics. We also compared our results to previous studies of RCW49 and found that our sample of X-ray sources provides a more complete picture of the stellar population in the region. Overall, our study contributes to our understanding of the processes involved in star formation and the evolution of young, massive stars.
760	This research paper explores the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in neutron stars and black holes, which provide insight into the dense matter and strong gravitational fields present in these objects. The authors discuss the theoretical models and observational evidence for QPOs in both types of objects and highlight the similarities and differences between them. They also explore the potential implications of QPOs for our understanding of fundamental physics and the properties of neutron stars and black holes. The paper concludes that QPOs offer a powerful tool for probing the physics of compact objects and that further observations and theoretical developments are necessary to fully understand these fascinating phenomena.
3743	We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.
1660	The paper explores the connection between Lie theory, deformation theory, and quantization. It shows that deformation theory provides a natural way to construct quantum groups from Lie algebras, and that this approach can be extended to noncommutative geometry. The paper also discusses the relationship between deformation quantization and the quantization of Poisson manifolds, and how these ideas can be applied to the study of geometric quantization. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between Lie theory, deformation theory, and quantization, and highlights the importance of these concepts in modern mathematical physics.
1405	In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal) DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental redundancy.
1782	"In this work, we study the size of the particles involved in a powder snow avalanche phenomenon. To determine these sizes, we study all the phenomena the particles have to face before arriving in the ""body"" of the avalanche. We study the boundary layer which is at the bottom of the avalanche. We determine, with the help of experimental data, the range of size of the particles that can be entrained by the avalanche. We then examine the possibility for these particles to reach the top of the boundary layer, and so to take part in the avalanche. Our final result is that the more frequent particles suspended in a powder snow avalanche have a size lower than 200 micrometers."
2387	"The research paper titled ""Spitzer Observations of Low Luminosity Isolated and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies"" explores the properties of low-luminosity isolated galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies through Spitzer Space Telescope observations. The study reveals that these types of galaxies have a lower fraction of dust and gas compared to more massive galaxies and are likely to have formed through the gradual accretion of gas over a prolonged period. The findings suggest that low-luminosity isolated and low surface brightness galaxies could be crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the interplay between dark matter, gas, and stars."
766	"The research paper ""Prime Graphs and Exponential Composition of Species"" explores the connection between prime graphs and exponential composition of species. The primary theme of the paper is to study the properties of prime graphs and how they can be used to understand the combinatorial structure of exponential compositions of species. The paper presents several significant findings, including a characterization of prime graphs and their role in the decomposition of exponential compositions of species. The authors also provide several examples and applications of the theory in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and representation theory. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of prime graphs in understanding the complex combinatorial structures that arise in mathematical objects."
1236	This research paper investigates the self-organization processes in a laser system with a nonlinear absorber and external force influence. The system's behavior is studied through numerical simulations, and it is observed that the laser system exhibits a range of dynamical regimes, including periodic, chaotic, and quasiperiodic behavior. The effects of different parameters, such as the strength of the external force and the nonlinearity of the absorber, on the system's dynamics are analyzed. The study finds that the system's behavior is highly sensitive to these parameters and can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. The results of this study have important implications for the design and optimization of laser systems for various applications.
3725	From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.
3215	It is shown that a graphene ribbon, a ballistic strip of carbon monolayer, may serve as a quantum wire whose electronic properties can be continuously and reversibly controlled by an externally applied transverse voltage. The electron bands of armchair-edge ribbons undergo dramatic transformations: The Fermi surface fractures, Fermi velocity and effective mass change sign, and excitation gaps are reduced by the transverse field. These effects are manifest in the conductance plateaus, van Hove singularities, thermopower, and activated transport. The control over one-dimensional bands may help enhance effects of electron correlations, and be utilized in device applications.
2008	"The research paper titled ""Hedging our bets: the expected contribution of species to future phylogenetic diversity"" examines the expected contribution of different species to the future of phylogenetic diversity. The study uses a novel approach to estimate the expected contribution of species based on their evolutionary distinctiveness and extinction risk. The research reveals that some species, even if they are not currently endangered, may have a more significant impact on future phylogenetic diversity than others. The paper concludes that conservation efforts should focus not only on currently endangered species but also on those with high potential for future contributions to phylogenetic diversity."
2675	This research paper discusses the development of a new, very massive modular Liquid Argon Imaging Chamber (LArTPC) for the detection of low energy off-axis neutrinos from the CNGS beam. The project, called MODULAr, aims to enhance the sensitivity of neutrino detectors and improve our understanding of neutrino properties. The paper presents the design and construction of the modular LArTPC, as well as its performance in detecting neutrino events. The outcomes of the project are promising, demonstrating the feasibility of using modular LArTPCs for neutrino detection and the potential for achieving high sensitivity to low energy neutrinos. The conclusions of the paper highlight the importance of continued research in this field to further advance our knowledge of neutrinos and their role in the universe.
979	"The research paper titled ""VIMOS spectroscopy of extended emission line regions"" focuses on the analysis of the spectroscopic properties of extended emission line regions in galaxies using the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument. The primary theme of the study is to provide insights into the physical conditions and kinematics of the ionized gas in these regions, and to investigate the possible mechanisms responsible for the observed emission lines. The research concludes that the extended emission line regions exhibit complex kinematic structures and multiple ionization mechanisms, indicating that they are likely the result of a combination of factors such as star formation, ionization by an active galactic nucleus, and shock excitation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of using VIMOS spectroscopy to better understand the properties of extended emission line regions in galaxies."
3437	The two dimensional analog of the Hadamard state condition is used to specify the local Hadamard states associated with a linear quantum field coupled to a two dimensional gravitational background. To characterize a local Hadamard state corresponding to a physical vacuum state, we apply a superselection rule in which the state dependent part of the two-point function is determined in terms of a dynamical scalar field. It implies a basic connection between the vacuum state and a scalar field coupled to gravity. We study the characteristics of the Hadamard vacuum state through this superselection rule using two different background metrics, the two dimensional analog of the schwarzschild and FRW metric.
3598	Magneto-optical imaging was used to observe dendritic flux avalanches connecting the outer and inner edges of a ring-shaped superconducting MgB2 film. Such avalanches create heated channels across the entire width of the ring, and inject large amounts of flux into the central hole. By measuring the injected flux and the corresponding reduction of current, which is typically 15%, we estimate the maximum temperature in the channel to be 100 K, and the duration of the process to be on the order of a microsecond. Flux creep simulations reproduce all the observed features in the current density before and after injection events.
920	"This research paper titled ""ASTROD I Charging Simulation and Disturbances"" aims to investigate the charging behavior and disturbances experienced by the ASTROD I spacecraft during its mission. The study uses a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to simulate the charging process and identify any potential sources of disturbances. The results of the simulation show that the spacecraft experiences significant charging during certain mission phases, which can lead to potential interference with sensitive instruments onboard. Additionally, the study identifies the sources of disturbances and provides recommendations for mitigation strategies to improve the reliability of the mission. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the charging behavior and disturbances that can impact spacecraft missions, particularly for long-duration missions like ASTROD I."
2791	We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts. First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then, the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to previous studies.
1255	We investigate the influence of spin-orbit interaction on ballistic transport through chaotic cavities by using semiclassical methods. Our approach is based on the Landauer formalism and the Fisher-Lee relations, appropriately generalized to spin-orbit interaction, and a semiclassical representation of Green functions. We calculate conductance coefficients by exploiting ergodicity and mixing of suitably combined classical spin-orbit dynamics, and making use of the Sieber-Richter method and its most recent extensions. That way we obtain weak anti-localization and confirm previous results obtained in the symplectic ensemble of Random Matrix Theory.
2600	This research paper investigates the obscured quasar population using optical, mid-infrared, and X-ray surveys. The primary theme of the study is to understand the nature of these quasars and their properties. The findings suggest that the obscured quasars have a significant contribution to the total quasar population and that they have a higher dust content than unobscured quasars. The study also highlights the importance of multi-wavelength surveys in identifying and characterizing these elusive objects. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the obscured quasar population and their role in the evolution of galaxies.
2753	Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of (relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
D1-29	The COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, but that doesn’t mean the novel coronavirus had originated from China. It may have originated from somewhere else. To determine the origin of an unknown virus requires scientific, meticulous research, instead of random speculation. The source of the virus is a scientific issue and requires a professional investigation. Without evidence supported by data or research, no one can claim where it had originated from. Connecting a virus with a region may cause xenophobic behavior. The pandemic influenza of 2009 originated in North America, but it was not called the “North America flu.” That is why the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus “COVID-19,” which avoids stigmatizing a particularly region.
2415	"The research paper titled ""Universal spectrum for DNA base CG frequency distribution in Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) genome"" explores the frequency distribution of the DNA base CG in the genome of Takifugu rubripes. The study employs a universal scaling analysis to investigate the genomic distribution of CG base pairs. The findings reveal that the CG frequency distribution follows a universal power-law distribution with an exponent of -1.7, which is consistent across different scales and chromosomes. This suggests that there is a fundamental organizational principle underlying the genomic distribution of CG base pairs in Takifugu rubripes. The study's results may have implications for understanding the evolutionary and functional aspects of genome organization in other species."
1714	"Fourier phases contain a vast amount of information about structure in direct space, that most statistical tools never tap into. We address ALMA's ability to detect and recover this information, using the probability distribution function (PDF) of phase increments, and the related concepts of phase entropy and phase structure quantity. We show that ALMA, with its high dynamical range, is definitely needed to achieve significant detection of phase structure, and that it will do so even in the presence of a fair amount of atmospheric phase noise. We also show that ALMA should be able to recover the actual ""amount"" of phase structure in the noise-free case, if multiple configurations are used."
2019	Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis is a theoretical framework that investigates the role of flavour symmetry in generating the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In this research paper, the authors propose a new model that incorporates flavour-dependent effects into Type II leptogenesis, which is a mechanism that generates a net lepton number asymmetry through the decay of heavy particles. The authors show that the model can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and that the flavour-dependent effects play a crucial role in this process. The proposed model also predicts new phenomena that can be tested in future experiments, providing a promising avenue for exploring the fundamental physics underlying the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.
135	The existing field theories are based on the properties of closed exterior forms, which correspond to conservation laws for physical fields. In the present paper it is shown that closed exterior forms corresponding to field theories are obtained from the equations modelling conservation (balance) laws for material sistems (material media). The process of obtaining closed exterior forms demonstrates the connection between field-theory equations and the equations for material sistems and points to the fact that the foundations of field theories must be conditioned by the properties of equations conservation laws for material sistems.
664	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of over-reflection and the generation of Gravito-Alfven waves in solar-type stars. Through numerical simulations and analysis of observational data, we show that over-reflection can occur in the outer layers of the stars, leading to the formation of Gravito-Alfven waves. These waves can play an important role in the dynamics and energy transport of the stellar atmosphere. We also discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the evolution and activity of solar-type stars. Our results suggest that Gravito-Alfven waves may be a common feature of these stars and could be a key factor in the heating of their outer atmospheres.
161	We consider a possible interpretation of the new charm-strange meson Ds0*(2317) as a hadronic molecule - a bound state of D and K mesons. Using an effective Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong Ds0* to Ds pi0 and radiative Ds0* to Ds* gamma decays. A new impact related to the DK molecular structure of the Ds0*(2317) meson is that the presence of u(d) quarks in the D and K mesons gives rise to a direct strong isospin-violating transition Ds0* to Ds pi0 in addition to the decay mechanism induced by eta-pi0 mixing considered previously. We show that the direct transition dominates over the eta-pi0 mixing transition in the Ds0* to Ds pi0 decay. Our results for the partial decay widths are consistent with previous calculations.
1764	Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to investigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In particular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion reactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry energy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting result and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the theoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams.
579	This research paper investigates the effect of decoherence on the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well potential. The study focuses on the rapid change of the potential and the resulting decoherence effects on the condensates. The results of the study show that the decoherence significantly affects the dynamics of the condensates, leading to the localization of the condensate in one of the wells and the loss of coherence between the two wells. The study concludes that controlling decoherence effects is crucial in manipulating the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in double-well potentials for potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation.
58	"The research paper titled ""Symmetry Relations for Trajectories of a Brownian Motor"" explores the properties of a Brownian motor, which is a device that can convert thermal energy into mechanical work. The authors investigate the symmetry properties of the motor's trajectory using mathematical models and simulations. The main finding of the study is that the motor's trajectory exhibits a remarkable symmetry, which is related to the underlying symmetries of the motor's structure. The authors also show that this symmetry can be broken by external perturbations, which can lead to changes in the motor's efficiency. Overall, the study provides new insights into the fundamental properties of Brownian motors and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics."
336	This research paper explores the use of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the analysis of resource-sensitive computations in programming languages. Through the use of linear logic and game semantics, we demonstrate how resource modalities can provide a powerful tool for reasoning about the allocation and consumption of resources in programming. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to the interpretation of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the construction of game models that accurately capture the behavior of resource-sensitive programs. Our findings suggest that the use of resource modalities in game semantics can greatly enhance our ability to reason about resource usage in programming languages.
2069	Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe, even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.
3982	We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a length-independent value in the presence of radiation.
1569	"The research paper titled ""Topological Winding and Unwinding in Metastable Bose-Einstein Condensates"" explores the behavior of a metastable Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subjected to a rotating potential. The study focuses on the formation of topological defects, specifically vortices, in the BEC and how they evolve over time. The authors investigate the dynamics of the vortices and their interactions with other defects, such as antivortices. They find that the vortices can undergo a process of unwinding, in which they merge with antivortices and disappear, or winding, in which they split and create new vortices. The study provides insight into the behavior of metastable BECs and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications."
2522	This research paper investigates the effect of supernova asymmetry on the coalescence rates of binary neutron stars. The study used numerical simulations to model the evolution of binary neutron stars, including their supernova explosions. The results showed that asymmetrical supernova explosions can significantly affect the coalescence rates of binary neutron stars, with some systems experiencing delays in their merger timescales. These findings have important implications for gravitational wave astronomy, as they suggest that the observed merger rates of binary neutron stars may be affected by the asymmetry of their supernova explosions.
2663	"The research paper titled ""Path integrals for stiff polymers applied to membrane physics"" aimed to develop a new method for simulating the behavior of stiff polymers in biological membranes. The researchers utilized a mathematical technique known as path integrals to model the movement of these polymers, which are critical components of cell membranes. The study found that the path integral approach allowed for more accurate modeling of the behavior of stiff polymers in membranes compared to previous methods. This led to new insights into the role of these polymers in membrane structure and function, which could have implications for understanding disease states such as cancer. Overall, the research paper demonstrates the potential of path integrals as a powerful tool for studying the complex physics of biological membranes and the polymers that make them up."
2784	This research paper explores the behavior of quasiparticles in neon through the Faddeev Random Phase Approximation (FRPA) method. The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of quasiparticles in understanding the electronic structure of neon. The results of the study indicate that the inclusion of quasiparticles leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of the energies of excited states of neon. The study also reveals that the FRPA method accurately describes the behavior of quasiparticles in neon. Overall, the findings suggest that the FRPA method can be a useful tool in investigating the behavior of quasiparticles in other materials.
2292	We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to this new probability range.
1463	This research paper presents the principle of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier and its application to a magnetoelectric measurement system. The primary focus is on the development of a software-based lock-in amplifier that can be used for multi-channel signal processing. The remarkable finding is that the proposed virtual lock-in amplifier can achieve the same performance as a hardware-based lock-in amplifier. The conclusion is that the virtual lock-in amplifier can be a cost-effective and flexible alternative to traditional hardware-based lock-in amplifiers for multi-channel signal processing.
599	This research paper investigates the fluidization behavior of a vertically oscillated shallow granular layer. The authors conducted experiments and simulations to analyze the effects of frequency and amplitude on the granular layer's fluidization threshold. They found that the layer's fluidization threshold decreases with increasing frequency, while amplitude has a minimal effect. The study also shows that the fluidization mechanism in the shallow layer is different from that in a deeper layer. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of granular materials and have implications for various engineering applications.
2156	In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.
2423	The research paper discusses microlocal asymptotic analysis in algebras of generalized functions. It explores the connection between microlocal analysis and the theory of generalized functions, and demonstrates the usefulness of microlocal techniques in the study of singularities of solutions to differential equations. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theory of algebras of generalized functions, and the main results and techniques of microlocal asymptotic analysis. Noteworthy findings include the development of a systematic approach to the study of singularities of solutions to differential equations using microlocal techniques, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of this approach in various applications. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of microlocal analysis in the study of singularities of solutions to differential equations, and provides a valuable resource for researchers and graduate students in this field.
2670	We describe a novel approach to prepare, detect and characterize magnetic quantum phases in ultra-cold spinor atoms loaded in optical superlattices. Our technique makes use of singlet-triplet spin manipulations in an array of isolated double well potentials in analogy to recently demonstrated quantum control in semiconductor quantum dots. We also discuss the many-body singlet-triplet spin dynamics arising from coherent coupling between nearest neighbor double wells and derive an effective description for such system. We use it to study the generation of complex magnetic states by adiabatic and non-equilibrium dynamics.
D2-21	The probability of extraterrestrial life existing remains one of science's great unknowns, with estimates varying widely based on different assumptions and models. While we lack direct evidence of life beyond Earth, several scientific factors inform our understanding: The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy by multiplying several probability factors. However, many of these factors remain highly uncertain. Many astrobiologists consider microbial life likely to exist elsewhere, with estimates ranging from cautious to highly optimistic. The probability of intelligent civilizations remains more speculative, with the Fermi Paradox (questioning why we haven't detected them) suggesting either rarity or communication difficulties.
3210	This research paper investigates the anisotropic quasiparticle renormalization in Na0.73CoO2 and the role of inter-orbital interactions and magnetic correlations in this process. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observe significant renormalization in the electronic structure of Na0.73CoO2. Our results demonstrate that inter-orbital interactions play a crucial role in the renormalization process, leading to anisotropic renormalization of the quasiparticle bands. We also find evidence for the presence of magnetic correlations, which further enhance the renormalization effect. Our findings provide new insights into the electronic properties of Na0.73CoO2 and have implications for the understanding of other correlated electron systems.
2464	A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and inflation.
616	Magnetic domain patterns under an oscillating field is studied theoretically by using a simple Ising-like model. We propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field. The first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out, and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns. The second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field, and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field.
1955	We analyze theoretically adiabatic quantum pumping through a normal conductor that couples the normal regions of two superconductor/normal metal/superconductor Josephson junctions. By using the phases of the superconducting order parameter in the superconducting contacts as pumping parameters, we demonstrate that a non zero pumped charge can flow through the device. The device exploits the evolution of the superconducting phases due to the ac Josephson effect, and can therefore be operated at very high frequency, resulting in a pumped current as large as a few nanoAmperes. The experimental relevance of our calculations is discussed.
1938	We report on the observation of enhanced microwave transmission through quasi-periodic hole arrays in metal films. The fraction of transmitted light reaches 50% in a self-standing metal film and approaches 90% when the film is sandwiched between thin dielectric slabs, while the holes occupy only 10% of the sample area. The maximum transmission is accompanied by zero phase change, rendering the film almost 'invisible' over a wide frequency range. The extraordinary transmission phenomenon is interpreted in terms of resonances in the self-consistent interaction between holes, which are represented by effective electric and magnetic dipoles.
536	This paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares. Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method.
1169	This research paper focuses on the identification and radius distribution of star clusters in the galaxy M51 using ACS imaging. The study identified 426 star clusters and found that the cluster radius distribution follows a power law with an index of -2.1, suggesting a self-similar formation process. The results also revealed a correlation between the cluster radius and the host galaxy's properties, such as the star formation rate and gas density. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of star clusters in M51.
2934	We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten micrometers over the full field of view.
2687	This research paper investigates the blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies and aims to determine whether they are genuine blue stragglers or a young stellar population. Using photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the color-magnitude diagrams of four dwarf spheroidal galaxies and compare them to theoretical models. Our results suggest that the blue plume population is likely a combination of both genuine blue stragglers and a young stellar population. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and their stellar populations.
1103	We study the transverse Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a Riemannian foliation on a compact manifold. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition when the transverse LS category is finite. We also introduce a variation on the concept of transverse LS category, the essential transverse category, and show that this is finite for every Riemannian foliation and coincides with the transverse category if the latter is finite. Moreover we prove that the essential transverse category is a lower bound for the number of critical leaf closures of a basic differentiable function on M.
2346	This research paper presents a study of structural properties of profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are widely used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and analysis. The paper discusses various structural properties of profile HMMs, including their length, number of states, and transition probabilities. The study also examines the effect of different structural properties on the accuracy of profile HMMs. Noteworthy findings include the importance of balancing sensitivity and specificity in profile HMMs and the potential benefits of using longer HMMs with more states. Overall, the paper concludes that understanding the structural properties of profile HMMs is critical for designing effective models for sequence alignment and analysis.
1228	"The research paper titled ""Correlation of macroscopic instability and Lyapunov times in the general three-body problem"" explores the relationship between the macroscopic instability and Lyapunov times in the three-body problem. The authors investigate the behavior of the three-body system under different initial conditions and show that the Lyapunov times provide a useful indicator of the system's stability. The study concludes that the Lyapunov times can be used to predict the onset of instability in the three-body problem, which has important implications for understanding the dynamics of celestial bodies."
2721	This research paper explores the capillary ordering and layering transitions in two-dimensional hard-rod fluids. Using computer simulations, the authors investigate the effects of rod length, density, and aspect ratio on the formation of layers and ordering in the fluid. The primary theme of the paper is to understand the mechanisms driving these transitions and their dependence on system parameters. The study reveals that the capillary ordering and layering transitions are strongly influenced by the rod length and density, and that aspect ratio plays a significant role in determining the nature of the transitions. The paper concludes that the findings provide insights into the behavior of hard-rod fluids, which have important applications in fields such as materials science and nanotechnology.
2713	This research paper explores the relationship between chaos and symmetry in string cosmology. The authors analyze the dynamics of a class of cosmological models that exhibit chaotic behavior and identify the role of symmetry in controlling this chaos. They find that the presence of certain symmetries can enhance the stability of the system and suppress chaotic behavior. Additionally, they uncover a connection between the symmetry properties of the models and the properties of the resulting cosmic microwave background radiation. These findings provide insights into the underlying structure of the universe and have important implications for our understanding of cosmology.
2050	The study focuses on the detection of single electron spin resonance in a double quantum dot, which has potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. The researchers used a combination of microwave and radio frequency pulses to manipulate the spin state of a single electron in the double quantum dot, and were able to detect the resulting resonance signal. This represents a significant step forward in understanding and controlling spin states at the single electron level. The study's outcomes could pave the way for the development of more efficient and accurate quantum computing systems, as well as improved magnetic sensing and imaging technologies.
1494	Combined effects of electron correlations and lattice distortions are investigated on the charge ordering in \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4 theoretically in a two-dimensional 3/4-filled extended Hubbard model with electron-lattice couplings. It is known that this material undergoes a phase transition from a high-symmetry metallic state to a low-symmetry insulating state with a horizontal-stripe charge order (CO) by lowering temperature. By means of the exact-diagonalization method, we show that electron-phonon interactions are crucial to stabilize the horizontal-stripe CO and to realize the low-symmetry crystal structure.
3761	Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.
2684	We consider the regions of the MSSM parameter space where the top squarks become light and even may be the LSP. This happens when the triple scalar coupling A becomes very big compared to m_0. We show that in this case the requirement that the LSP is neutral imposes noticeable constraint on the parameter space excluding low m_0 and m_{1/2} similar to constraint from the Higgs mass limit. In some cases these constraints overlap. This picture takes place in a wide region of \tan\beta. In a narrow band close to the border line the stops are long-lived particles and decay into quarks and neutralino (chargino). The cross-section of their production at LHC via gluon fusion mechanism in this region may reach a few pb.
1486	Light and cold extrasolar planets such as OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, a 5.5 Earth-mass planet detected via microlensing, could be frequent in the Galaxy according to some preliminary results from microlensing experiments. These planets can be frozen rocky- or ocean-planets, situated beyond the snow line and, therefore, beyond the habitable zone of their system. They can nonetheless host a layer of liquid water, heated by radiogenic energy, underneath an ice shell surface for billions of years, before freezing completely. These results suggest that oceans under ice, like those suspected to be present on icy moons in the Solar system, could be a common feature of cold low-mass extrasolar planets.
3972	We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.
3451	Fermi, Pasta and Ulam observed, that the excitation of a low frequency normal mode in a nonlinear acoustic chain leads to localization in normal mode space on large time scales. Fast equipartition (and thus complete delocalization) in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain is restored if relevant intensive control parameters exceed certain threshold values. We compare recent results on periodic orbits (in the localization regime) and resonant normal forms (in a weak delocalization regime), and relate them to various resonance overlap criteria. We show that the approaches quantitatively agree in their estimate of the localization-delocalization threshold. A key ingredient for this transition are resonances of overtones.
3552	This paper studies the performance of a wireless data network using energy-efficient power control techniques when different multiple access schemes, namely direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB), are considered. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit expressions for the achieved utilities at the Nash equilibrium are derived in terms of the network parameters. A measure of the loss of DS-CDMA with respect to IR-UWB is proposed, which proves substantial equivalence between the two schemes. Simulation results are provided to validate the analysis.
D2-37	Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a close relationship. The likelihood and severity of type 2 diabetes are closely related to BMI. Obese people have a higher risk of diabetes than healthy weight people, with a threefold increase in risk for overweight people. While it is well known that body fat distribution is an important primary indicator of diabetes risk, the precise mechanism of association is unknown. It is also unknown why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and why not all type 2 diabetics are obese. Also obesity significantly increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in your life. When there is an excess of fat, the tissues must process more nutrients.
1894	We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find an analytical expression for the Mott insulator(MI)-Superfluid(SF) transition boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex, reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum. Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than one.
732	This research paper focuses on the redistribution of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a quasiperiodic optical lattice. The study investigates the impact of lattice potential on the dynamics of solitons in BEC. The authors demonstrate that the quasiperiodic lattice potential can trigger the redistribution of solitons in BEC, leading to significant changes in the system's behavior. The study provides important insights into the fundamental properties of BEC and the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. The findings of this research can be valuable in the development of new technologies that utilize BEC, such as quantum computing and precision metrology.
2714	We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of two samples of evolved stars selected in the field and in the intermediate-age open cluster IC 4651, for which detailed measurements of chemical composition were made in the last few years. Applying the Gray's method based on ratios of line depths, we determine the effective temperature and compare our results with previous ones obtained by means of the curves of growth of iron lines. The knowledge of the temperature enables us to estimate other fundamental stellar parameters, such as color excess, age, and mass.
D1-5	According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller plates. These move continuously at a slow pace, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created). During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the theory of plate tectonics.
449	We present an experimental study of the dynamics underlying the buildup and decay of dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a single semiconductor quantum dot. Our experiment shows that the nuclei can be polarized on a time scale of a few milliseconds, while their decay dynamics depends drastically on external parameters. We show that a single electron can very efficiently depolarize the nuclear spins and discuss two processes that can cause this depolarization. Conversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear spin polarization is on the time scale of a second, most likely limited by the non-secular terms of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. We can further suppress this depolarization rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude by applying an external magnetic field exceeding 1 mT.
1500	We consider the stability of a porous medium submitted to a steady-state flow with free-boundary. Assuming some hypotheses, it is possible to implement the kinematic method by using an approximate pressure field bounding the true pressure field from below. We are interested in finding such approximate pressure fields and in proving that they bound the true pressure field from below without knowing the true pressure field. We use fields which are solutions of a problem with relaxed conditions with regard to the real problem. Under a uniqueness condition of the solution of a weak formulation of the problem, such fields are lower bounds for the true pressure field. Finally, we give the example of a vertical dam.
1649	To synthesize a new superconductor which has a critical temperature, Tc, exceeding the room temperature, one needs to know what chemical components to start with. This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one to draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential room-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room temperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and atoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion is fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any assumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This, however, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is an easy task.
719	We present a formalism of x-ray dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics with large numerical aperture and high aspect ratio, in an analogy to the Takagi-Taupin equations for strained single crystals. We derive a set of basic equations for dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics, which enable us to study the focusing property of these optics with various grating profiles. We study volume diffractive optics that satisfy the Bragg condition to various degrees, namely flat, tilted and wedged geometries, and derive the curved geometries required for ultimate focusing. We show that the curved geometries satisfy the Bragg condition everywhere and phase requirement for point focusing, and effectively focus hard x-rays to a scale close to the wavelength.
3458	This research paper focuses on the uniqueness and non-uniqueness of chains on half lines. In particular, the study investigates the conditions under which a chain on a half line is unique or non-unique. The paper employs a rigorous mathematical analysis to explore various scenarios that may lead to either uniqueness or non-uniqueness of chains. The findings of this research have significant applications in several fields, including physics, engineering, and mathematics. This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of chains on half lines, which can aid in the development of more accurate models and simulations in various applications.
2702	Molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation are performed for two extreme cases of complex metallic alloys (CMAs): In a model quasicrystal the structure is determined by clusters of atoms, whereas the model C15 Laves phase is a simple periodic stacking of a unit cell. The simulations reveal that the basic building units of the structures also govern their fracture behaviour. Atoms in the Laves phase play a comparable role to the clusters in the quasicrystal. Although the latter are not rigid units, they have to be regarded as significant physical entities.
D2-49	"According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single ""Primorial Particle"". ""Divine Volition"", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology."
3590	This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.
1545	This research paper explores the possibility of using D-branes as a means of constructing a bubbling Calabi-Yau manifold. Calabi-Yau manifolds are fundamental objects in string theory, and have been extensively studied due to their importance in understanding the extra dimensions predicted by the theory. This paper presents a new approach to constructing Calabi-Yau manifolds by studying the behavior of D-branes in the presence of fluxes. The paper demonstrates that D-branes can indeed be used to construct a bubbling Calabi-Yau manifold, and discusses the implications of this result for further research in string theory. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe.
65	This research paper presents a mid-infrared laser light nulling experiment using single-mode conductive waveguides. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of nulling laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths using waveguides. The experiment was conducted using a CO2 laser and a single-mode conductive waveguide made of silicon. The results of the experiment show that the waveguide successfully nulls the laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths. The study concludes that single-mode conductive waveguides can be an effective approach for nulling laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths, which has important implications for applications in astronomy and remote sensing.
2923	Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in the Heisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and Kerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied via Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact of decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for beating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902 (2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an appreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an increase in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence effect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing information is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the enhancement is able to survive.
287	We give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed equivariant total Chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed bundles by a linear group action. This fine moduli scheme is described explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions. We use this description to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy Murphy's Law, in the sense of Vakil. The preliminary sections of the paper give a self-contained introduction to Klyachko's classification of toric vector bundles.
2901	"The abstract of the research paper titled ""Reply to 'Comment on 'Heavy element production in inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis'"" highlights the response of the authors to criticisms raised in the comment regarding their previous research. The authors defend their findings and argue that the inhomogeneity of the early universe played a crucial role in the production of heavy elements. They emphasize that their calculations are consistent with observational data and provide a better understanding of the nucleosynthesis process. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering inhomogeneity in future studies of big bang nucleosynthesis."
2710	We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural scaling model.
537	We study Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a two-band boson Hubbard model, which can be mapped onto a spin-1/2 XY model with spins coupled to an additional Ising degree of freedom. By using a modified mean field theory that include the effects of phase fluctuations, we show that the transition is first order at both zero and finite temperatures. On the Mott insulator side, there may be reentrance in phase transition. These features are consequences of the underlying transition between competing defect poor and defect rich phases. The relevance of the model and our results to supersolid 4He and cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices are discussed.
338	The birefringence phenomenon in the vacuum with a constant magnetic background of arbitrary strength is considered within the framework of the effective action approach. A new feature of the birefringence in a magnetized vacuum is that the parallel mode, which is polarized parallel to the plane containing the magnetic field and the photon wave vector, is no longer transverse. We have studied this feature in detail for arbitrary magnetic field and provided analytic results for the ultra-strong magnetic field regime. Possible physical implications of our results in astrophysics are discussed.
3308	This research paper explores the use of scalar field confinement as a model for accreting systems. The central focus of the study is to investigate the behavior of scalar fields in the presence of a black hole and the implications for understanding the accretion process. Through computational simulations, the authors demonstrate that scalar fields can become confined in the vicinity of a black hole, leading to enhanced accretion rates. The study offers important insights into the dynamics of accreting systems and the role of scalar fields in driving the accretion process.
581	The paper presents a quantum theory of orbital magnetization and its generalization to interacting systems. The theory is based on the use of the Berry phase and the adiabatic approximation, which allows for a description of the magnetic properties of quantum systems. The authors show that the theory provides a better understanding of the magnetization of materials and can be used to predict the properties of materials with potential applications in electronics and spintronics. The results suggest that the theory can be used to explain complex phenomena observed in condensed matter systems and that it has potential for use in the development of new materials.
2864	We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie, Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model, a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.
1865	Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for a micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit. A Lorentz force, generated by the passive back-action of the resonator's displacement, can cool down the thermal motion of the mechanical resonator by applying an appropriate microwave drive to the qubit. We show that this onchip cooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response time of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible experimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be cooled down by several orders of magnitude.
2660	We introduce a novel extension of the Gutzwiller variational wavefunction able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we find that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron repulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.
3575	The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space. The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link several solutions to the direct kinematic problem without meeting a singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. Additional surfaces are characterized in the workspace which yield new uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator.
2325	We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational mode.
358	We introduce a new model for the dynamics of a wormlike chain in an environment that gives rise to a rough free energy landscape, which we baptise the glassy wormlike chain. It is obtained from the common wormlike chain by an exponential stretching of the relaxation spectrum of its long-wavelength eigenmodes, controlled by a single stretching parameter. Predictions for pertinent observables such as the dynamic structure factor and the microrheological susceptibility exhibit the characteristics of soft glassy rheology and compare favourably with experimental data for reconstituted cytoskeletal networks and live cells. We speculate about the possible microscopic origin of the stretching, implications for the nonlinear rheology, and the potential physiological significance of our results.
D2-90	The principle of positron emission tomography (PET) is that radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical injected intravenously into a patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations. This is a technology that is extremely useful in the detection and treatment of diseases like cancer. However, there is some confusion about how PET works. Before PET was introduced a different type of radiation imaging called SPECT (single-photon emission computerised tomography) was used. This technology was based on the pinhole camera technique whereby a reverse image of an object is obtained by passing the light through a small aperture or pinhole.
179	This paper presents a geometric description of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on Lie affgebroids subject to affine nonholonomic constraints. We define the notion of nonholonomically constrained system, and characterize regularity conditions that guarantee that the dynamics of the system can be obtained as a suitable projection of the unconstrained dynamics. It is shown that one can define an almost aff-Poisson bracket on the constraint AV-bundle, which plays a prominent role in the description of nonholonomic dynamics. Moreover, these developments give a general description of nonholonomic systems and the unified treatment permits to study nonholonomic systems after or before reduction in the same framework. Also, it is not necessary to distinguish between linear or affine constraints and the methods are valid for explicitly time-dependent systems.
D2-11	These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter. People at high risk of not getting enough vitamin D, all children aged 1 to 4, and all babies (unless they're having more than 500ml of infant formula a day) should take a daily supplement throughout the year. There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19).
1421	We compare the roles of fidelity and entanglement in characterizing renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions. It turns out that the scaling parameter extracted from fidelity for different ground states succeeds to capture nontrivial information including stable and unstable fixed points, whereas the von Neumann entropy as a bipartite entanglement measure (or equivalently, majorization relations satisfied by the spectra of the reduced density matrix along renormalization group flows) often fails, as far as the intrinsic irreversibility-information loss along renormalization group flows-is concerned. We also clarify an intimate connection between the von Neumman entropy, majorization relations, and fidelity. The relevance to Zamolodchikov's c theorem is indicated.
3682	We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.
1814	The spectrum of large radius exciton in an individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is described within the framework of elementary potential model, in which exciton is modeled as bound state of two oppositely charged quasi-particles confined on the tube surface. Due to the parity of the interaction potential the exciton states split into the odd and even series. It is shown that for the bare and screened Coulomb electron-hole (e-h) potentials the binding energy of even excitons in the ground state well exceeds the energy gap. The factors preventing the collapse of single-electron states in isolated semiconducting SWCNTs are discussed.
933	We tailor the shape and phase of the pump pulse spectrum in order to study the coherent lattice dynamics in tellurium. Employing the coherent control via splitting the pump pulse into a two-pulse sequence, we show that the oscillations due to A1 coherent phonons can be cancelled but not enhanced as compared to single pulse excitation. We further demonstrate that a decisive factor for the coherent phonon generation is the bandwidth of the pulse spectrum and not the steepness of the pulse envelope. We also observe that the coherent amplitude for long pump pulses decreases exponentially independent of the shape of the pulse spectrum. Finally, by varying the pulse chirp, we show that the coherent amplitude is independent of while the oscillation lifetime is dependent on the chirp sign.
4037	We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The \pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
D2-40	An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways.
1895	This research paper investigates the phase boundary of the boson Mott insulator in a rotating optical lattice. The authors explore the effects of rotation on the behavior of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice and determine the critical rotation frequency at which the Mott insulator transitions to a superfluid state. The study finds that rotation can significantly modify the phase boundary and provides insights into the behavior of quantum systems in rotating environments. The results have important implications for the development of quantum technologies and the understanding of fundamental physics.
42	This paper investigates particle motion in the rotating black ring metric, a solution to the equations of General Relativity describing a five-dimensional black hole with a ring topology around its event horizon. The authors derive the equations of motion for test particles moving in this metric and analyze their behavior in various regimes, including geodesic motion, circular orbits, and chaotic trajectories. They find that the black ring metric exhibits several interesting features, such as the existence of stable circular orbits in the plane of rotation and the appearance of chaotic behavior for particles with nonzero angular momentum. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of black hole spacetimes and may have implications for astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks and binary black hole mergers.
1452	In this contribution I will attempt to show that the study of galactic 6.7 and 12.2GHz methanol masers themselves, as opposed to the use of methanol masers as signposts, can yield important conclusions contributing to the understanding of high-mass star formation. Due to their exclusive association with star formation, methanol masers are the best tools to do this, and their large number allows to probe the entire Galaxy. In particular I will focus on the determination of the luminosity function of methanol masers and on the determination of an unambiguous signature for a circumstellar masing disc seen edge-on. Finally I will try to point out some future fields of research in the study of methanol masers.
3115	"A parametric study of so-called ""super growth"" of single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminum oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs. Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates."
2983	This research paper aims to investigate and compare the effects of driven activation and thermal activation on the performance of a particular system. The study uses experimental methods to explore the differences in activation mechanisms and their impact on the system's output. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the experimental results, including the characterization of the activation mechanisms and the identification of the key factors that influence system performance. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of driven activation and thermal activation, and the implications of these mechanisms for the design and optimization of systems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research in this area.
2848	This research paper investigates the oriented growth of pentacene films on vacuum-deposited polytetrafluoroethylene layers that are aligned using the rubbing technique. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the alignment on the morphology and electrical properties of the pentacene films. The results indicate that the rubbing technique produces highly aligned polytetrafluoroethylene layers, which leads to the formation of highly oriented pentacene films. The electrical conductivity of the pentacene films is found to be strongly dependent on the orientation of the film and the direction of the current flow. The study concludes that the rubbing technique can be used to control the orientation and electrical properties of pentacene films, which is important for the development of organic electronic devices.
D2-89	Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, covers 836,330 square miles in the North Atlantic, with approximately 80% of its surface covered by ice. An autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a population of about 56,000, predominantly Inuit. The capital, Nuuk, houses roughly one-third of its inhabitants. Despite its name, most of Greenland experiences Arctic conditions with limited vegetation. Its economy relies on fishing, tourism, and substantial mineral resources, including rare earth elements becoming increasingly valuable due to climate change. Greenlandic culture blends traditional Inuit practices with Scandinavian influences. Climate change poses significant challenges as the melting ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise while simultaneously opening new economic opportunities through increased resource accessibility.
2763	A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and dissipated in the outer solar layers. Progress in this field has been slow and painstaking. However, advances in computer hardware and numerical methods, vastly increased observational capabilities and growing physical insight seem finally to be leading towards understanding. Here we present exploratory numerical MHD models that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE radiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin radiative losses as well as magnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the transition region and corona.
D1-13	Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e., law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions (i.e., the law of constant composition), the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions. In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor transmute one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.
2354	We investigate possible mass shift and width broadening of J/psi in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rule. Input values of gluon condensates at finite temperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and pressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~ 1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results in change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the phenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach maximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.
2823	This research paper presents a study of the proper motion of L and T dwarf stars within the Pleiades star cluster. By using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the authors identified 21 L and T dwarf candidates as potential members of the Pleiades. Through further analysis of their proper motions and comparison with known members of the cluster, they confirmed 10 of these candidates as likely members. This study expands our understanding of the population of low-mass stars within the Pleiades and highlights the potential of using proper motion as a tool for identifying new cluster members.
2158	We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo.
2255	This paper presents an algebraic generalization of Kripke structures, which are commonly used in modal logic to model systems with multiple states. By introducing an algebraic structure based on the lattice of sub-formulas of a given formula, the authors are able to capture the essence of Kripke structures in a more abstract and flexible way. The paper provides a formal definition of this algebraic structure, explores its properties and relationships with other modal logics, and shows how it can be used to reason about complex systems. The authors conclude that their algebraic generalization provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing a wide range of systems, including those that cannot be adequately represented by traditional Kripke structures.
1752	We investigate the behavior of the directed current in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions driven by local periodic potentials in the forward as well in backscattering channels. We treat the problem with Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We present the exact solution for the case of an infinite wire and show that in this case the dc current vanishes identically. We also investigate a confined system consistent in an annular arrangement coupled to a particle reservoir. We present a perturbative treatment that allows for the analytical expressions of the dc current in the lowest order of the amplitudes of the potential. We also present results obtained from the exact numerical solution of the problem.
996	We consider a finite quantum system coupled to quasifree thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Under the assumptions of small coupling and exponential decay of the reservoir correlation function, the large deviation generating function of energy transport into the reservoirs is shown to be analytic on a bounded set. Our method is different from the spectral deformation technique which was employed recently in the study of spin-boson-like models. As a corollary, we derive the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation for the entropy production and a central limit theorem for energy transport.
2889	This research paper presents a novel approach to solving the high energy evolution equation with the inclusion of running coupling corrections. The study utilizes a perturbative QCD approach and employs the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) formalism. The results indicate that the running coupling corrections play a significant role in the evolution of parton distribution functions at high energies. The study also demonstrates the importance of including higher-order corrections in the evolution equation. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of hadrons at high energies and can provide insights into the nature of strong interactions. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of high energy physics and can guide future experimental investigations.
614	In this paper we develop a scientific approach to control inter-country conflict. This system makes use of a neural network and a feedback control approach. It was found that by controlling the four controllable inputs: Democracy, Dependency, Allies and Capability simultaneously, all the predicted dispute outcomes could be avoided. Furthermore, it was observed that controlling a single input Dependency or Capability also avoids all the predicted conflicts. When the influence of each input variable on conflict is assessed, Dependency, Capability, and Democracy emerge as key variables that influence conflict.
2761	We show that r-mode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond pulsars are rare.
2580	"The research paper ""Scanning tunnelling microscopy for ultracold atoms"" explores the use of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) in the study of ultracold atoms. The main theme of the paper is the development of a high-resolution imaging technique that allows scientists to observe and manipulate individual atoms in ultracold atomic ensembles. The authors discuss the advantages and challenges of using STM in this field, and present important results and conclusions from their experiments. These include the successful imaging of ultracold atoms on a surface, the ability to manipulate individual atoms with the STM tip, and the observation of collective behavior of atoms in the ensemble. The paper highlights the potential of STM for advancing our understanding of ultracold atoms and their applications in fields such as quantum computing and simulation."
3276	This paper investigates the use of poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a finite cylinder. In particular, we focus on the development of influence matrices for the decomposition, which can be used to identify the impact of various physical and geometric parameters on the MHD equations. We present a detailed derivation of the influence matrices, as well as numerical simulations to demonstrate their efficacy. Our results highlight the importance of considering the poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of MHD equations in a finite cylinder, and provide a valuable tool for future research in this area.
2020	We present observations of a solar quiet region obtained by the ground-based Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and by instruments on the spacecraft SOHO and TRACE. The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.
17	This research paper presents a new determination of the extragalactic background of diffuse gamma rays that takes into account the potential contributions from dark matter annihilation. Using a combination of observational data and theoretical modeling, we calculate the expected gamma ray flux from dark matter annihilation in the intergalactic medium and include it in our analysis. Our results indicate that the contribution from dark matter annihilation is significant and cannot be ignored when determining the extragalactic background of diffuse gamma rays. This new determination has important implications for our understanding of the nature and distribution of dark matter in the universe.
339	In this paper we investigate a class of swing options with firm constraints in view of the modeling of supply agreements. We show, for a fully general payoff process, that the premium, solution to a stochastic control problem, is concave and piecewise affine as a function of the global constraints of the contract. The existence of bang-bang optimal controls is established for a set of constraints which generates by affinity the whole premium function. When the payoff process is driven by an underlying Markov process, we propose a quantization based recursive backward procedure to price these contracts. A priori error bounds are established, uniformly with respect to the global constraints.
D1-2	The cell cycle is the process by which a cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and divides into two daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and reproduction. The cycle consists of four main phases. In G₁ phase, the cell grows, produces proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. During the S phase, DNA is replicated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy. The G2 phase follows, where the cell continues growing and checks for DNA damage before proceeding to division. Finally, in the M phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where chromosomes are separated, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits.
1949	This research paper investigates the magnetic induction in a turbulent flow of liquid sodium by examining the mean behavior and slow fluctuations. The study uses numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the magnetic induction equation to analyze the behavior of liquid sodium under magnetic fields. The results indicate that the mean behavior of the liquid sodium is significantly affected by the magnetic field, with the flow becoming more organized and aligned with the magnetic field direction. On the other hand, slow fluctuations in the flow are found to be less affected by the magnetic field. The findings of this study have important implications for the design and operation of liquid metal cooling systems in nuclear reactors and other industrial applications.
1644	We study thermal Casimir and quantum non-retarded Lifshitz interactions between dielectrics in general geometries. We map the calculation of the classical partition function onto a determinant which we discretize and evaluate with the help of Cholesky factorization. The quantum partition function is treated by path integral quantization of a set of interacting dipoles and reduces to a product of determinants. We compare the approximations of pairwise additivity and proximity force with our numerical methods. We propose a ``factorization approximation'' which gives rather good numerical results in the geometries that we study.
348	We find actual evidence, relying upon vorticity time series taken in a high Reynolds number atmospheric experiment, that to a very good approximation the surface boundary layer flow may be described, in a statistical sense and under certain regimes, as an advected ensemble of homogeneous turbulent systems, characterized by a lognormal distribution of fluctuating intensities. Our analysis suggests that usual direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, may play an important role in the study of turbulent boundary layer flows, if supplemented with appropriate statistical information concerned with the structure of large scale fluctuations.
D1-24	Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on the planet, supporting millions of marine species and providing essential services like coastal protection and livelihoods for humans. However, their health is rapidly declining due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for energy, often leading to mass die-offs. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons, further threatening reef stability. The future of coral reefs depends on urgent conservation efforts. Strategies like reducing carbon emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and coral restoration projects (e.g., coral farming) offer hope. Research into resilient coral species and reef rehabilitation techniques is also promising.
D2-57	"In modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.  The experiment poses the question, ""when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?"" (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox."
2529	We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation. Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.
3424	This research paper investigates the ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system using numerical simulations. The primary theme is to understand the dynamics of the vortex system and its response to external driving forces. The paper finds that the system exhibits ageing memory, where its response depends on the history of the driving force. Additionally, the system shows glassy behavior, where its relaxation time increases as the temperature decreases. These findings provide insights into the complex behavior of driven vortex systems and have implications for a range of physical systems that exhibit similar dynamics.
3177	"The research paper titled ""Brane World Black Rings"" explores the possibility of black rings in the context of brane world scenarios. The paper investigates the classical and thermodynamic properties of black rings in brane world models and discusses the implications of such models for understanding the nature of gravity. The study concludes that black rings in brane world scenarios provide a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of black holes in higher dimensions and to test the validity of brane world models. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of gravity and the fundamental structure of the universe."
2899	The research paper presents a Finite Element framework for computing protein normal modes and mechanical response. The main theme of the paper is to develop a method that can accurately calculate the normal modes of proteins, which are essential for understanding protein function and dynamics. The paper uses a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Finite Element Analysis to compute the normal modes of proteins. The results show that the proposed method is effective in accurately calculating the normal modes of proteins. Furthermore, the paper also explores the mechanical response of proteins under different loading conditions. The conclusion of the paper is that the developed method can be a useful tool in understanding the mechanical properties of proteins and their response to external stimuli.
28	This research paper aims to explore the growth mechanisms of quasicrystals, a unique class of materials with non-periodic ordered structures. By analyzing the growth behavior of quasicrystals using advanced imaging techniques and simulations, the paper provides insights into the role of chemical composition, temperature, and substrate interactions in the formation of these materials. The study finds that quasicrystal growth is a complex process influenced by various physical and chemical factors, which can lead to the formation of a wide range of structures and morphologies. The paper concludes that a better understanding of quasicrystal growth can facilitate the design and synthesis of new materials with tailored properties for various applications.
3250	This paper explores the relationship between the extent of the eigenstates of a system and the resonances formed through its coupling to a field. Using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how the size of the eigenstates affects the formation and properties of resonances. Our results show that the extent of the eigenstates plays a crucial role in determining the resonance frequencies and widths, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for weak coupling strengths. We discuss the implications of our findings for various physical systems, including atoms, molecules, and solid-state devices, and suggest possible avenues for future experimental and theoretical research. Overall, this study sheds new light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying resonance phenomena and provides important insights into the design and optimization of resonant devices and systems.
2501	The research paper investigates the electron transport properties in nanogranular ferromagnets, which are made up of small magnetic particles. The authors use a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to examine the electronic transport behavior in these materials and observe a strong dependence on the size of the magnetic particles. The findings suggest that the electron transport in nanogranular ferromagnets is highly tunable and could have potential applications in spintronics and magnetic storage devices. The study concludes that the understanding of electron transport in nanogranular ferromagnets could lead to the development of more efficient and effective electronic devices.
3062	We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconducting flux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization can be used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin film resistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity of photonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of a high frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequency oscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discuss the performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. This device illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropy as the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of the resistor.
1283	A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images was developed in the framework of the MAGIC-5 Italian project. One of the main goals of this project is to build a distributed database of lung CT scans in order to enable automated image analysis through a data and cpu GRID infrastructure. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system, a dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier for false-positive finding reduction, are described. The system was designed and tested for both internal and sub-pleural nodules. The results obtained on the collected database of low-dose thin-slice CT scans are shown in terms of free response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves and discussed.
2508	When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing, \lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles.
3042	This research paper explores the jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the accretion and ejection processes in these systems. Using numerical simulations and theoretical models, the study investigates the impact of jet interactions on the X-ray emission and variability. The results reveal that the presence of jets can significantly affect the accretion flow and produce strong X-ray variability. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the jet properties, such as speed and orientation, play a crucial role in determining the X-ray emission characteristics. Overall, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between the accretion and jet processes in massive X-ray binaries and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical efforts to fully understand these systems.
1061	Black hole (BH) oscillations known as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are one of the most important gravitational wave (GW) sources. We propose that higher perturbative order of QNMs, generated by nonlinear gravitational interaction near the BHs, are detectable and worth searching for in observations and simulations of binary BH mergers. We calculate the metric perturbations to second-order and explicitly regularize the master equation at the horizon and spatial infinity. We find that the second-order QNMs have frequencies twice the first-order ones and the GW amplitude is up to ~10% that of the first-order one. The QNM frequency would also shift blueward up to ~1%. This provides a new test of general relativity as well as a possible distance indicator.
850	The article discusses the potential of two long period, massive binary systems (HD 37366 and HD 54662) as targets for long baseline optical interferometry. The authors analyze the available data on these systems, including photometric and spectroscopic observations, to determine their physical parameters and orbital properties. They then explore how these systems could be studied using interferometry techniques to gain further insights into their properties and evolution. The authors conclude that both HD 37366 and HD 54662 are excellent targets for interferometry observations and could provide valuable information about the physics of massive binary systems. Overall, the article highlights the importance of using advanced observational techniques to better understand the properties and evolution of binary star systems.
2506	We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the observational result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.
184	We present in this paper three dynamic clustering techniques for Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs). The first two, Dynamic, Statistical & Tunable Clustering (DSTC) and StatClust, exploit both comprehensive usage statistics and the inter-object reference graph. They are quite elaborate. However, they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead. The third clustering technique, called Detection & Reclustering of Objects (DRO), is based on the same principles, but is much simpler to implement. These three clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store and compared in terms of clustering efficiency (i.e., overall performance increase) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark (OCB). The results obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving better overall performance.

The study considers the effects of fading on the peaky signaling, and derives the closed-form expressions for the error probability of the peaky signaling over Rayleigh and generalized fading channels. The results show that the error probability of the peaky signaling is significantly affected by the channel fading. It is also found that the performance of the peaky signaling is improved by increasing the peakiness factor. The findings of this study provide insights for the design of reliable communication systems over fading channels using peaky signaling.

374	This research paper explores the complex behavior of electrons in graphene, specifically focusing on the interplay between the orthogonality catastrophe and the Kondo effect. The orthogonality catastrophe refers to the disruption of electron scattering due to the sudden introduction of a perturbation.

By examining the interplay between these two phenomena in graphene, this paper sheds light on the fundamental physics of electron behavior in this material and has potential implications for the development of future electronic devices.
1065	We calculate the radiative properties for a linear dipole-coupled chain of qubits. Using the explicit energy eigenstates of the system, we find the radiation patterns for spontaneous transitions from the one-photon eigenstates to the ground state of the system. We show that depending on the excitation of a specific atom, the radiation tends to be focused either along or perpendicular to the chain. We conclude with a derivation of the total decay rate of the one-photon eigenstates, and find the interesting result that for systems where the photon wavenumber is not much larger than the interatomic spacing, up to 94% of the eigenstates are subradiant, that is, they decay significantly slower than a single atom in isolation.

1694	We investigate the competition between pairing correlations and ferromagnetism in small metallic grains in the presence of a Zeeman field. Our analysis is based on the universal Hamiltonian, valid in the limit of large Thouless conductance. We show that the coexistence regime of superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations can be made experimentally accessible by tuning an external Zeeman field. We compare the exact solution of the model with a mean-field theory and find that the latter cannot describe pairing correlations in the intermediate regime. We also study the occurrence of spin jumps across the phase boundary separating the superconducting and coexistence regimes.

We compute zero momentum hydrodynamic response functions of maximally supersymmetric 2+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at the conformal fixed point, in the large N limit. With background magnetic field B and electric charge density rho, the Hall conductivity is found to be rho/B. The result, anticipated on kinematic grounds in field theory, is obtained from perturbations of a four dimensional AdS black hole with both electric and magnetic charges.

1432	This research paper aims to investigate the reason behind the observed lower X-ray luminosity of accreting T Tauri stars when compared to non-accretors. The primary theme is to understand the mechanism of X-ray emission in these stars and to determine how accretion affects their X-ray luminosity. Based on a review of existing literature and analysis of observational data, the study concludes that the lower X-ray luminosity is likely due to the presence of dense accretion disks that absorb and reprocess X-rays. The study also suggests that the accretion process itself may play a role in reducing X-ray emission. These findings have implications for our understanding of star formation and the role of accretion in shaping the properties of young stars.

651	In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable configuration is a small-world graph.
D2-60	The dangers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, stem from their persistence in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate in living organisms. Known as 'forever chemicals,' PFAS do not break down easily, leading to long-term environmental contamination. They are found in products like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and water-repellent textiles. PFAS can enter the human body through contaminated drinking water and food, particularly in areas near industrial sites. Prolonged exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including certain cancers, hormonal disruptions, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, PFAS contribute to ecosystem harm by affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Their long-lasting nature makes them a significant environmental and public health concern, as they are challenging to eliminate.
3658	We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement

245	The frictional heating by ion-neutral drift is calculated and its effect on isobaric thermal instability is carried out. Ambipolar drift heating of one-dimensional self-gravitating magnetized molecular slab is used under the assumptions of quasi-magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibrium. We see that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions. The results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in some regions of the slab; therefore it may produce the slab fragmentation and formation of the AU-scale condensations.
832	The article presents an ergodic model for the expansion of spherical nanoplasmas, which is a fundamental process in laser-matter interactions. The model takes into account the non-equilibrium dynamics of the plasma, and considers the plasma expansion in the presence of an external magnetic field. The results show that the magnetic field can significantly affect the plasma expansion, leading to the formation of an anisotropic plasma cloud. The model also predicts the evolution of the plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field strength during the expansion process, providing insights into the underlying physics. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering the non-equilibrium dynamics and the role of external fields in understanding the expansion of nanoplasmas, which can have applications in areas such as plasma physics, materials science, and laser-based technologies.
4006	This research paper explores the possibility of geometrically engineering the Standard Model by locally unfolding three families out of the exceptional Lie group E8. We propose a novel approach to constructing the Standard Model using geometric structures derived from E8, which allows for the unification of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. Our method involves the identification and manipulation of specific substructures within E8, leading to the emergence of a three-family fermion spectrum. We investigate the implications of this approach, including potential experimental signatures, and discuss its relevance to ongoing efforts in theoretical physics. Overall, our work suggests that geometric engineering may provide a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.

The results show that there are a total of 1,615,611,958 distinct 7-colourings of a 6x6 square grid, and the authors provide a classification of these colorings based on their symmetries. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical applications of this work, including the use of 7-colourings in designing visual art and creating encryption algorithms.
99	At the air/water interface, 4,-8-alkyl[1,1,-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (8CB) domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same Langmuir film, as multiple bilayers on a monolayer. The edge dislocation at the domain boundary leads to line tension, which determines the domain shape and dynamics. By observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions, we find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference between the coexisting phases in the film. Comparisons with theoretical treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary locates near the center of the film, which means that the 8CB multilayers are almost symmetric with respect to the air/water interface.

2074	"We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The notion of ""relational"" is the common denominator of two views. We have approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a possible structure of physical reality?"
1746	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a Dirac field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, (background) Lorentz invariance and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons in the presence of a Dirac field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a Dirac field are also emphasized.
2088	We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.
2426	We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple and general tool for lifting additivity results.
3929	This research paper investigates the relaxation phenomena in high-temperature superconductors HoBa2Cu3O7-d under the influence of pulsed magnetic fields. The main objective of the study is to understand the behavior of the superconductor under the influence of a magnetic field and to determine the factors that affect its relaxation. The experiment involves applying pulsed magnetic fields with varying strengths to the superconductor and measuring its relaxation time. The study reveals that the relaxation time of the superconductor is affected by the strength of the magnetic field and the temperature of the sample. The results also suggest that the relaxation time of the superconductor can be used as an indicator of its superconducting properties. The study has important implications for the development of high-temperature superconductors for practical applications in various fields.
3866	We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.
1738	We study the dynamics of the 2+1 Dirac oscillator exactly and find spin oscillations due to a {\it Zitterbewegung} of purely relativistic origin. We find an exact mapping of this quantum-relativistic system onto a Jaynes-Cummings model, describing the interaction of a two-level atom with a quantized single-mode field. This equivalence allows us to map a series of quantum optical phenomena onto the relativistic oscillator, and viceversa. We make a realistic experimental proposal, at reach with current technology, for studying the equivalence of both models using a single trapped ion.

Ultimately, the findings have implications for understanding cultural markets and the role of social influence in shaping popular taste."
2291	This research paper investigates the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids and their relativistic effects including pressure, multi-component, curvature, and rotation. The study uses a set of equations to model the behavior of these fluids and analyzes the impact of various factors on their evolution. The results show that these second-order perturbations can have significant effects on the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the early stages of its formation. The study also highlights the importance of considering relativistic effects when modeling cosmological fluids. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the complex behavior of cosmological fluids and their role in shaping the universe.
856	Motivated by applications to quantum field theory we consider Gibbs measures for which the reference measure is Wiener measure and the interaction is given by a double stochastic integral and a pinning external potential. In order properly to characterize these measures through DLR equations, we are led to lift Wiener measure and other objects to a space of configurations where the basic observables are not only the position of the particle at all times but also the work done by test vector fields. We prove existence and basic properties of such Gibbs measures in the small coupling regime by means of cluster expansion.
649	"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestr""om-Kakeya theorem."

The method is based on the likelihood ratio test and uses a Bayesian approach to estimate the threshold for signal detection. The authors show that this method outperforms traditional methods that do not consider the sample size, especially when the number of samples is small. The method is demonstrated through simulations and real-world examples, and the results show that it is effective in detecting signals in various scenarios. The authors conclude that considering sample size is crucial for accurate signal detection and that their proposed method can be a useful tool for researchers and practitioners in signal processing and related fields.

1334	The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.
1126	This research paper investigates the impact of Mn doping on the magnetic properties of ZnO at room temperature. Through a combination of experimental techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic measurements, we demonstrate that the introduction of Mn into ZnO leads to a significant enhancement in the magnetic moment.

These results provide insight into the fundamental properties of Mn-doped ZnO and highlight the potential for further research in this area.
938	This research paper proposes a new approach to derive effective stochastic interactions in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations using force covariance analysis. The analysis is based on the fluctuations of the conservative forces and dissipation forces in DPD simulations, which enable the identification of the effective stochastic interactions in the system. The results demonstrate that this method can accurately predict the effective interactions in a variety of DPD systems, including those with complex structures and non-equilibrium dynamics. This approach provides a new tool for understanding the behavior of complex fluids and soft matter systems.
541	We sketch the derivation of a Newtonian gravity-like force emerging from a direct-action variant of classical electromagnetism. The binding energy is a consequence of maximal phase correlation of the sources mediated by approximately monochromatic direct-action fields. The resulting force then has the character of a strong version of the van der Waals force, whose superior strength can be attributed to relatively coherent primary fields (compared with the totally incoherent effects of the ZPF). The model also predicts the existence of a background having some of the character of dark energy.
2723	This research paper aims to investigate the generation of entanglement outside of the light cone, which refers to a phenomenon where two quantum particles share a state despite being separated by a distance that is too great for any signal to travel between them. The study explores the possibility of creating such entanglement and examines its potential applications in quantum communication and computation. The research findings indicate that entanglement outside of the light cone can be generated through certain physical processes, and its properties have been characterized and analyzed. The paper concludes that this phenomenon has significant implications for the development of future quantum technologies and provides a promising avenue for exploring the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
755	We present a numerical study of a quantum phase transition from a spin-polarized to a topologically ordered phase in a system of spin-1/2 particles on a torus. We demonstrate that this non-symmetry-breaking topological quantum phase transition (TOQPT) is of second order. The transition is analyzed via the ground state energy and fidelity, block entanglement, Wilson loops, and the recently proposed topological entropy. Only the topological entropy distinguishes the TOQPT from a standard QPT, and remarkably, does so already for small system sizes. Thus the topological entropy serves as a proper order parameter. We demonstrate that our conclusions are robust under the addition of random perturbations, not only in the topological phase, but also in the spin polarized phase and even at the critical point.
932	"The research paper titled ""Reaction rate calculation by parallel path swapping"" focuses on a new approach to calculate reaction rates in complex chemical systems. The authors propose using a parallel path swapping algorithm that can efficiently handle large systems and multiple reaction pathways. The method involves swapping parallel reaction pathways to calculate the rate of each reaction. The authors tested the algorithm on several complex chemical systems, including a catalytic cracking reaction and a combustion reaction. The results show that the parallel path swapping algorithm is an accurate and efficient method for calculating reaction rates. The authors conclude that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the understanding of complex chemical systems and aid in the design of new catalysts and processes."
3394	Results are presented for the leading two-loop contributions of O(alpha_t alpha_s) to the masses and mixing effects in the Higgs sector of the MSSM with complex parameters. They are obtained in the Feynman-diagrammatic approach using on-shell renormalization. The full dependence on all complex phases is taken into account. The renormalization of the appropriate contributions of the Higgs-boson sector and the scalar top and bottom sector is discussed. Our numerical analysis for the lightest MSSM Higgs-boson mass is based on the new two-loop corrections, supplemented by the full one-loop result. The corrections induced by the phase variation in the scalar top sector are enhanced by the two-loop contributions. We find that the corresponding shift in M_h1 can amount to 5 GeV.
1902	We study the behaviour of the C60 molecule under very high internal or external pressure using Tersoff as well as Brenner potentials. As a result, we estimate the critical internal and external pressures that lead to its instability. We also calculate stretching force constant and bulk modulus of this molecule at several pressures under which the molecule remains stable. The values of these estimated here at zero pressure agree closely with those obtained in earlier calculations. We also observe that at high pressures, a finite value of parameter of Tersoff potential gives physically acceptable results in contrast to its value zero, which is usually taken for the carbon systems.
771	In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the Taylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.
3253	Longitudinal studies could be complicated by left-censored repeated measures. For example, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, there is a detection limit of the assay used to quantify the plasma viral load. Simple imputation of the limit of the detection or of half of this limit for left-censored measures biases estimations and their standard errors. In this paper, we review two likelihood-based methods proposed to handle left-censoring of the outcome in linear mixed model. We show how to fit these models using SAS Proc NLMIXED and we compare this tool with other programs. Indications and limitations of the programs are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown.
1870	We look for wide, faint companions around members of the 5 Myr Lambda Orionis open cluster. We used optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. We report the discovery of a very wide very low mass visual binary, LOri167, formed by a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass candidate located at 5 arcsec, which seems to belong to the cluster. We derive Teff of 2125 and 1750 K. If they are members, comparisons with theoretical models indicate masses of 17 (20-15) Mjup and 8 (13-7) Mjup, with a projected separation of 2000 AU. Such a binary system would be difficult to explain in most models, particularly those where substellar objects form in the disks surrounding higher mass stars.
2499	This research paper proposes a novel linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model of self-synchronizing oscillators. By introducing a linear transformation, the model is shown to be more tractable and amenable to analysis. The proposed reformulation is applied to a variety of scenarios, including networks with heterogeneous coupling strengths and non-identical oscillator frequencies. The results demonstrate that the reformulated model accurately predicts synchronization behavior, and allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive self-synchronization. Overall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, and offers new insights into the Kuramoto model and its applications.
940	The article is devoted to the investigation of groups of diffeomorphisms and loops of manifolds over ultra-metric fields of zero and positive characteristics. Different types of topologies are considered on groups of loops and diffeomorphisms relative to which they are generalized Lie groups or topological groups. Among such topologies pairwise incomparable are found as well. Topological perfectness of the diffeomorphism group relative to certain topologies is studied. There are proved theorems about projective limit decompositions of these groups and their compactifications for compact manifolds. Moreover, an existence of one-parameter local subgroups of diffeomorphism groups is investigated.
D2-31	Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human health, primarily regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption for bone formation and maintenance. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight, but it can also be obtained through diet (fatty fish, egg yolks) and supplements. The recommended daily intake is 600-800 IU for most adults, though needs increase with age and limited sun exposure. Deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, muscle weakness, and potentially increased risk of certain chronic diseases. Factors affecting vitamin D status include geographical location, season, skin pigmentation, age, and dietary habits. Regular moderate sun exposure combined with dietary sources provides sufficient vitamin D for most people.
2871	This research paper explores the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles. The central focus is on examining the behavior of magnetic particles at low temperatures and how they interact with each other to form frozen states. The study uses simulations and experiments to investigate the magnetic properties of these systems. The outcomes of the study reveal that the magnetic particles exhibit highly correlated behavior, and their interactions lead to the formation of a frozen state. The paper concludes that understanding the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles is vital for developing new materials with unique magnetic properties.
3733	We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
1048	This research paper investigates the behavior of localized electron states near a metal-semiconductor nanocontact. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe the formation of these states and their dependence on the contact size and applied voltage. Our results suggest that these states arise from the quantum confinement of electrons within the nanocontact, and their energy levels can be tuned by adjusting the contact size and voltage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of these localized states can significantly affect the electronic transport properties of the nanocontact, with implications for the design of nanoscale electronic devices. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the behavior of electron states in metal-semiconductor nanocontacts and their potential applications in nanoelectronics.
577	This research paper presents an inequality for the Perron and Floquet eigenvalues of monotone differential systems and age-structured equations. The main objective of the paper is to derive a new inequality that relates the Perron and Floquet eigenvalues of these systems. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of this inequality in the analysis of population models and delay differential equations. The paper provides a rigorous proof of the inequality and shows that it is sharp. The authors also present several numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the inequality. The key conclusion of the paper is that the new inequality is a powerful tool for the analysis of monotone differential systems and age-structured equations, and can lead to new insights into the behavior of these systems.
1578	In this article it is shown that, Sommerfeld's coefficients for excitonic transitions in quantum wells are determined only with the principle quantum number within the framework of two-dimensional Coulomb potential. This is a consequence of hidden symmetry of two-dimensional Coulomb problem, conditioned by the existence of two-dimensional analog of the Runge-Lentz vector. For the narrow gap semiconductor quantum well with the non-parabolic dispersion law of electron and hole in the two-band Kane model it is shown that two-dimensional excitonic states are described in the frames of an analog of Klein-Gordon equation with the two-dimensional Coulomb potential. The non-stability of the ground state of the two-dimensional Kane's exciton is show.
3068	This research paper explores the use of a narrow-line laser for three-dimensional cooling and trapping of atoms. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the efficiency and limitations of this method in comparison to traditional methods, as well as to explore potential applications in quantum computing and precision measurements. The results showed that the narrow-line laser was highly efficient and allowed for greater control over the atoms' motion and positioning. Additionally, the study found that this method could be used to create more complex trapping geometries, which could be useful for future quantum computing applications. Overall, the findings suggest that narrow-line cooling and trapping has great potential for advancing the field of atomic physics and quantum technologies.
835	This research paper investigates the structure of sunspot penumbrae, with a specific focus on the origin of dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains. The study utilizes the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium model to analyze penumbral flux tubes. The results suggest that the dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains originate from the convective overshoot region and the MHS equilibrium in penumbral flux tubes. The findings shed light on the fundamental physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of sunspot penumbrae. This research has significant implications for our understanding of the dynamics of sunspots and their impact on space weather.
837	"The research paper titled ""Multiple pattern matching: A Markov chain approach"" proposes a novel method for efficiently identifying multiple patterns in a given sequence. The approach utilizes a Markov chain framework to model the underlying patterns and their relationships in the sequence. The proposed method was compared with existing approaches and was found to be more efficient in terms of computational time and memory usage. The authors conclude that the Markov chain approach offers a promising solution for multiple pattern matching in various applications such as bioinformatics and natural language processing."
2647	"One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D\""ur-Cirac (DC) method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems, there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled fraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial transposition."
1776	Recently, one of us (H.S.) gave an explicit form of the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action of QED. We first rederive the identity using a functional method. The identity makes it possible to realize the gauge symmetry even in the presence of a momentum cutoff. In the cutoff dependent realization, the abelian nature of the gauge symmetry is lost, breaking the nilpotency of the BRS transformation. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we extend the Wilson action by including the antifield contributions. Then, the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action is lifted to a quantum master equation, and the modified BRS transformation regains nilpotency. We also obtain a flow equation for the extended Wilson action.
1960	The research paper explores the effects of modified mass matrix and gravity on lepton number violation and CPT symmetry in the neutrino sector. The study proposes a modified mass matrix for neutrinos that incorporates the effects of gravity and predicts new patterns of neutrino oscillation. The authors investigate the impact of this modified mass matrix on CPT symmetry and lepton number violation, and suggest that these violations may be observable in future experiments. The study provides insight into the fundamental properties of neutrinos and the role of gravity in neutrino physics.
1736	A SU(4) flavor symmetrical Lagrangian is constructed for the interaction of the pseudo-scalar mesons with the vector mesons. SU(4) symmetry is broken to SU(3) by suppression of terms in the Lagrangian where the interaction should be driven by charmed mesons. Chiral symmetry can be restored by setting this new SU(4) symmetry breaking parameters to zero. Unitarization in coupled channels leads to the dynamical generation of resonances. Many known axial resonances can be identified including the new controversial X(3872) and the structure found recently by Belle around 3875 MeV in the hidden charm sector. Also new resonances are predicted, some of them with exotic quantum numbers.
3111	The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT observations of gamma-ray binaries.
25	From a detailed analysis of InN epilayers deposited in a close-coupled showerhead metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system under various conditions we investigate the effect of growth parameters on the lattice constants of the InN layer. The layers are under significant internal hydrostatic stress which influences the optical properties. Samples typically fall into two broad categories of stress, with resultant luminescence emission around 0.8eV and 1.1eV. We can correlate the internal stress in the layer and the value of the optical absorption edge, and the PL emission wavelength.
2298	The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the supersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a vortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex formation.
3201	A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter, for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences. Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.
2631	We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends upon the solution of an elliptic equation and upon harmonic functions. Starting with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere. Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.
3475	This research paper explores the potential role of cloudy gas accretion as a source of interstellar turbulence in the outer regions of disks. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the behavior of the turbulent flow generated by the interaction of cloudy gas with the surrounding interstellar medium. Our results suggest that cloudy gas accretion can indeed contribute to the generation of turbulence in the outskirts of disks, with implications for the transport of material and the formation of stars in these regions. We discuss the implications of our findings for current models of disk evolution and suggest avenues for future observational and theoretical work in this area.
3927	"This research paper titled ""FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V. Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects"" focuses on the milliarcsecond-scale morphology of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources. The study uses high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) imaging techniques to investigate the detailed structure of CSS objects. The authors present the results of their observations of 22 CSS sources and provide a detailed analysis of their morphology. The study finds that the majority of CSS sources show complex structures, with evidence of multiple components and/or jet-like features. The authors conclude that these results are consistent with the idea that CSS sources are likely to be young radio sources in the process of evolving into larger-scale radio galaxies."
869	The paper explores the concept of equifocality in a singular Riemannian foliation. It investigates the properties of the foliation and its relationship with the geometry of the underlying manifold. The main result of the paper is the proof of equifocality of the foliation, which implies the existence of a unique geodesic in each leaf of the foliation. This result has important implications in various areas of mathematics, including differential geometry and geometric analysis. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the equifocality property and its potential applications in future research.
3505	This research paper investigates the demixing and orientational ordering of mixtures of rectangular particles. The main objectives of this study are to understand the effect of particle shape and size on demixing and to explore the emergence of orientational order in the system. The research findings demonstrate that particle shape and size play a critical role in the demixing process, with larger particles exhibiting stronger demixing tendencies. Additionally, the study reveals that orientational ordering in the system is influenced by the presence of both size and shape asymmetry. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental physics of particle mixtures and has potential implications for the design of functional materials.
3249	We examine resonances for two systems consisting of a particle coupled to a massless boson's field. The field is the free field in the whole space. In the first system, the particle is confined inside a ball. We show that besides the usual energy levels of the particle, which have become complex through the coupling to the field, other resonances are to be taken into account if the ball's radius is comparable to the particle's Compton wavelength. In the second system, the particle is in a finite-depth square-well potential. We study the way the resonances' width depends on the extent of the uncoupled particle's wave functions. In both cases, we limit ourselves to considering two levels of the particle only.
382	We have analyzed a large sample of numerically simulated clusters to demonstrate the adverse effects resulting from use of X-ray fitted beta-model parameters with Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) data. There is a fundamental incompatibility between model fits to X-ray surface brightness profiles and those done with SZE profiles. Since observational SZE radial profiles are in short supply, the X-ray parameters are often used in SZE analysis. We show that this leads to biased estimates of the integrated Compton y-parameter inside r_{500} calculated from clusters. We suggest a simple correction of the method, using a non-isothermal beta-model modified by a universal temperature profile, which brings these calculated quantities into closer agreement with the true values.
966	We report on measurements of an elementary surface mode in an ultracold, strongly interacting Fermi gas of 6Li atoms. The radial quadrupole mode allows us to probe hydrodynamic behavior in the BEC-BCS crossover without being influenced by changes in the equation of state. We examine frequency and damping of this mode, along with its expansion dynamics. In the unitarity limit and on the BEC side of the resonance, the observed frequencies agree with standard hydrodynamic theory. However, on the BCS side of the crossover, a striking down shift of the oscillation frequency is observed in the hydrodynamic regime as a precursor to an abrupt transition to collisionless behavior; this indicates coupling of the oscillation to fermionic pairs.
3580	We study infinite tree and ultrametric matrices, and their action on the boundary of the tree. For each tree matrix we show the existence of a symmetric random walk associated to it and we study its Green potential. We provide a representation theorem for harmonic functions that includes simple expressions for any increasing harmonic function and the Martin kernel. In the boundary, we construct the Markov kernel whose Green function is the extension of the matrix and we simulate it by using a cascade of killing independent exponential random variables and conditionally independent uniform variables. For ultrametric matrices we supply probabilistic conditions to study its potential properties when immersed in its minimal tree matrix extension.
3738	This research paper explores the nonlinear dynamics of the phonon stimulated emission in a microwave solid-state resonator of the nonautonomous phaser generator. The study investigates the behavior of the system when subjected to external stimuli and analyzes the impact of nonlinearity on the emission of phonons. The research presents a theoretical model and numerical simulations to illustrate the dynamics of the system. The results demonstrate the importance of nonlinearity in the behavior of the phonon stimulated emission, highlighting the potential for developing efficient and robust phaser generators. The findings of this study have significant implications for the field of solid-state quantum electronics and could contribute to the development of new technologies.
D2-29	Synthetic biology emerged as a specialized branch of bioengineering over the last 15-20 years, propelled by the technologies of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis. The emphasis is now on characterizing molecular components and standardizing them so that they work together. Today, computer programming languages have become more abstract by building upon previous languages, making it easier and faster to create complex programs. Similarly, in the future, standardized molecular components will make biology understandable through abstraction. This will in turn make it easier to engineer new functions. Of course any biological abstraction would rely on molecular details (just like all computer code is finally executed as assembly), so studying molecular biology is very worthwhile.
320	This research paper focuses on SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2, a white dwarf star with a gaseous debris disc. The main objective of the study was to analyze the properties of the disc and understand its formation. The authors used various observational techniques, including spectroscopy and imaging, to study the system. The crucial finding of the study was the detection of a second white dwarf with a gaseous debris disc, which suggests that such systems may be more common than previously thought. The study also provides insight into the evolution of planetary systems and the fate of their debris after the star dies.
3574	The research paper focuses on the kinematic design of a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-dof) hybrid manipulator, which combines the advantages of both serial and parallel manipulators. The authors present the mathematical model of the manipulator and derive its kinematic equations, which are used to analyze its motion characteristics. They also propose a novel approach for optimizing the manipulator's workspace using a genetic algorithm. The results of the study show that the proposed manipulator has a large workspace and good motion performance, making it suitable for various applications in industry and automation. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid manipulators.
3025	"In this paper we give a definition of ""algorithm,"" ""finite algorithm,"" ""equivalent algorithms,"" and what it means for a single algorithm to dominate a set of algorithms. We define a derived algorithm which may have a smaller mean execution time than any of its component algorithms. We give an explicit expression for the mean execution time (when it exists) of the derived algorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with two component algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions for two-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of several general forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithm processor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation scheme with which to analyze empirical processing time data."
1139	"The research paper titled ""Pseudo-supersymmetry and a Tale of Alternate Realities"" explores the concept of pseudo-supersymmetry in quantum mechanics, a theoretical framework that suggests the existence of alternate realities. The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the theory and discusses its potential implications for the field of physics. The results suggest that pseudo-supersymmetry could provide a new perspective on the nature of reality and may have practical applications in the development of quantum technologies. Overall, the paper offers a thought-provoking exploration of a fascinating area of theoretical physics."
1346	The study focuses on analyzing the ultraviolet spectra of ten dwarf novae in outburst using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite. The researchers aimed to investigate the physical properties of the accretion disks and white dwarf stars that are responsible for the outbursts. They discovered that the spectra of the dwarf novae showed evidence of emission from accretion disks, white dwarfs, and hot gas. The study also revealed that the outbursts of dwarf novae are caused by the instabilities in the accretion disks. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the physics of accretion disks and help to better understand the behavior of dwarf novae.
1679	In this research paper, the authors investigate the zero-energy states and fragmentation of spin in the easy-plane antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice. They use the Schwinger boson mean-field theory to analyze the ground state properties of the system and find that it exhibits a rich variety of zero-energy states. They also study the fragmentation of spin and find that it is sensitive to the anisotropy of the spin interactions. The authors conclude that the zero-energy states and fragmentation of spin in the easy-plane antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice are important factors that need to be considered when studying the properties of such systems.
1525	This research paper presents an analysis of INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray binary system HER X-1. HER X-1 is a well-studied system that exhibits a 35-day periodicity in its X-ray emission, thought to be caused by the precession of its accretion disk. The INTEGRAL observations provide high-energy coverage of the system, allowing for a detailed investigation of the spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-ray emission. The results of this analysis provide important insights into the physical processes at work in HER X-1, and contribute to our understanding of the behavior of accreting X-ray binaries in general.
3265	The paper focuses on clustering maximal frequent patterns in streams. The authors propose a novel algorithm that can cluster co-occurrence of maximal frequent patterns in real-time streams. The proposed algorithm is designed to handle high-dimensional and large-scale data and can effectively identify clusters of patterns with high co-occurrence. The authors evaluate the algorithm using real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying clusters of frequent patterns. The main outcome of the study is the proposed algorithm, which provides a useful tool for analyzing and clustering frequent patterns in real-time streams. The study also highlights the importance of efficient data mining algorithms for handling high-dimensional and large-scale data.
1302	This research paper presents a spectroscopic investigation of spin zero homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the electronic structures and vibrational properties of these molecules through the use of various spectroscopic techniques. The experimental methods employed include infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results obtained from these experiments are analyzed and compared to theoretical predictions, providing insight into the nature of the chemical bonds and the molecular properties of these systems. The findings of this study have important implications for the understanding of molecular structure and bonding, and could have potential applications in fields such as materials science and pharmaceuticals.
3078	Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass exo-planets.
1648	The research paper investigates the single photoeffect on helium-like ions in the non-relativistic region. The study employs a theoretical approach based on the Dirac-Fock method and uses a detailed numerical analysis to investigate the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions. The study shows that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions are highly sensitive to the nuclear charge and electron correlation. The findings indicate that the photoionization cross section of helium-like ions increases with increasing nuclear charge, while it decreases with increasing electron correlation. The study concludes that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions can provide valuable insights into the atomic structure and dynamics of heavy ions.
1697	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of phylogenetic mixtures, where multiple evolutionary processes occur on a single tree. The study finds that these mixtures can create a tree topology that mimics another, despite being distinct in their underlying evolutionary processes. The research provides insights into the potential pitfalls of inferring evolutionary relationships based solely on tree topology and highlights the importance of considering multiple evolutionary processes in phylogenetic analysis. The findings suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting tree topologies and emphasize the need for more comprehensive approaches to phylogenetic analysis.
3959	This research paper investigates the impact of environmental noise on the performance of holonomic quantum gates and proposes a method for reducing noise to improve gate fidelity. The study utilized numerical simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different noise reduction techniques, including dynamical decoupling and optimal control. The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the impact of noise on holonomic gates, leading to improved gate performance and increased robustness against environmental disturbances. The study concludes that noise reduction is essential for achieving high-fidelity holonomic gates, which are critical for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
72	"The research paper titled ""An Analysis of the Shapes of Interstellar Extinction Curves. V. The IR-Through-UV Curve Morphology"" focuses on analyzing the shapes of interstellar extinction curves. The primary theme of this research is to study the morphology of IR-through-UV extinction curves and investigate their variations in different environments. The research findings suggest that the shape of the extinction curve depends on the physical properties of the interstellar environment, such as the size distribution of dust grains and the abundance of heavy elements. The conclusions drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the nature and evolution of interstellar dust and the interstellar medium."
1192	The Drell-Yan process is a standard tool for probing the partonic structure of hadrons. Since the process proceeds through a quark-antiquark annihilation, Drell-Yan scattering possesses a unique ability to selectively probe sea distributions. This review examines the application of Drell-Yan scattering to elucidating the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon's sea and nuclear modifications to the sea quark distributions in unpolarized scattering. Polarized beams and targets add an exciting new dimension to Drell-Yan scattering. In particular, the two initial-state hadrons give Drell-Yan sensitivity to chirally-odd transversity distributions.
3478	The Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that is valid for a chemical reaction that proceeds along the reaction coordinate over the transition state is extended to molecular dynamics trajectories that in general do not cross the dividing surface between the initial and the final local minima at the exact transition state. Our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle states that low energy molecular dynamics trajectories are more likely to lead into the basin of attraction of a low energy local minimum than high energy trajectories. In the context of global optimization schemes based on molecular dynamics our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle implies that using low energy trajectories one needs to visit a smaller number of distinguishable local minima before finding the global minimum than when using high energy trajectories.
485	We conduct a review of experimental results on Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR's) including measurements of the features of the spectrum, the composition of the primary particle flux and the search for anisotropy in event arrival direction. We find that while there is a general consensus on the features in the spectrum -- the Second Knee, the Ankle, and (to a lesser extent) the GZK Cutoff -- there is little consensus on the composition of the primaries that accompany these features. This lack of consensus on the composition makes interpretation of the agreed upon features problematic. There is also little direct evidence about potential sources of UHECRs, as early reports of arrival direction anisotropies have not been confirmed in independent measurements.
1226	The paper proposes a novel supervised feature selection method based on dependence estimation. The proposed method utilizes the dependency between the features and the target variable to select the most relevant features. The method is compared with several existing feature selection methods on various benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the others in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method is also shown to be robust to noise and highly interpretable. In conclusion, the paper offers a promising approach for feature selection in supervised learning tasks.
2516	We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring significant penalties.
3783	Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a pulse doublet sequence.
3432	This research paper presents a numerical method for the poloidal-toroidal decomposition of vector fields in a finite cylinder. The decomposition is performed using a discretization scheme that is regularized to ensure stability and accuracy. The accuracy of the method is validated by comparing the results with analytical solutions and benchmark tests. The paper also discusses the limitations of the method and suggests areas for future research. Overall, this study provides a useful tool for the analysis of vector fields in cylindrical geometries, with potential applications in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, and geophysics.
3745	We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event.
260	The research paper proposes a new method for creating and propagating order along Ising spin chains using geodesics. The authors demonstrate that geodesics, which are the shortest paths between two points on a curved surface, can be used to efficiently transfer information between distant spins in the chain. They show that their method is more efficient than traditional methods such as quantum annealing and simulated annealing. The authors conclude that geodesics provide a promising approach for creating and manipulating order in spin chains, with potential applications in fields such as quantum computing and machine learning.
904	Link homotopy has been an active area of research for knot theorists since its introduction by Milnor in the 1950s. We introduce a new equivalence relation on spatial graphs called component homotopy, which reduces to link homotopy in the classical case. Unlike previous attempts at generalizing link homotopy to spatial graphs, our new relation allows analogues of some standard link homotopy results and invariants. In particular we can define a type of Milnor group for a spatial graph under component homotopy, and this group determines whether or not the spatial graph is splittable. More surprisingly, we will also show that whether the spatial graph is splittable up to component homotopy depends only on the link homotopy class of the links contained within it. Numerical invariants of the relation will also be produced.
646	This research paper explores the development of a surface-gated InSb quantum well single electron transistor (SET) for use in low-temperature electronic applications. The primary theme of the study is the use of a surface gate to control the electron transport through the transistor. The researchers found that the surface gate was successful in controlling the electron transport, and they were able to demonstrate single-electron charging effects in the device. The paper also presents an analysis of the device's performance and concludes that the surface-gated SET has the potential to be a promising platform for future electronic applications.
639	We introduce a distributed algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor networks. Our algorithm assumes that nodes in the network only know their immediate neighborhoods and an upper bound on the network's diameter. Clock-synchronization messages are only sent as part of the communication, assumed reasonably frequent, that already takes place among nodes. The algorithm has the gradient property of [2], achieving an O(1) worst-case skew between the logical clocks of neighbors. As in the case of [3,8], the algorithm's actions are such that no constant lower bound exists on the rate at which logical clocks progress in time, and for this reason the lower bound of [2,5] that forbids constant skew between neighbors does not apply.
3313	We examine transport through a quantum dot coupled to three ferromagnetic leads in the regime of weak tunnel coupling. A finite source-drain voltage generates a nonequilibrium spin on the otherwise non-magnetic quantum dot. This spin accumulation leads to magnetoresistance. A ferromagnetic but current-free base electrode influences the quantum-dot spin via incoherent spin-flip processes and coherent spin precession. As the dot spin determines the conductance of the device, this allows for a purely magnetic transistor-like operation. We analyze the effect of both types of processes on the electric current in different geometries.
1929	This research paper examines the role of narratives within immersive technologies, exploring how they can enhance user experience and engagement. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the paper explores the different types of narratives that can be incorporated into immersive technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The paper also highlights the potential benefits of using narratives within immersive technologies, such as increased emotional connection and improved learning outcomes. Ultimately, the paper concludes that incorporating narratives within immersive technologies can enhance user experiences and lead to more engaging and effective interactions.
3299	The recent detection of the hydrocarbon anion C6H- in the interstellar medium has led us to investigate the synthesis of hydrocarbon anions in a variety of interstellar and circumstellar environments. We find that the anion/neutral abundance ratio can be quite large, on the order of at least a few percent, once the neutral has more than five carbon atoms. Detailed modeling shows that the column densities of C6H- observed in IRC+10216 and TMC-1 can be reproduced. Our calculations also predict that other hydrocarbon anions, such as C4H- and C8H-, are viable candidates for detection in IRC+10216, TMC-1 and photon-dominated regions such as the Horsehead Nebula.
477	The recently proposed theoretical model of superconductors endowed with two distinct superconducting phases and critical temperatures is further analyzed by introducing two distinct order parameters, described by two scalar fields which condensate at different temperatures. We find some deviations in basic thermodynamical quantities with respect to the Ginzburg-Landau one-phase superconductors. In particular, by contrast to the usual case where only one jump in specific heat takes place at the normal-superconductor transition temperature, we actually predict an additional discontinuity for C_V when passing from a superconducting phase to the other one.
3242	This research paper aims to investigate the emergence of universal properties in rank distributions by exploring the algebraic basis of the beta-like function. The study utilizes mathematical models and analytical tools to examine the relationship between the beta-like function and tail universalities in rank distributions. The paper highlights the significance of the beta-like function as a basis for understanding the underlying algebraic structure of power-law distributions. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that govern the emergence of universal properties in complex systems and provide insights into the mathematical foundations of power-law distributions. Overall, this study sheds light on the algebraic problem of tail universalities in rank distributions and presents the beta-like function as a potential solution.
3755	Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.
1670	"The article ""Dissipation in graphene and nanotube resonators"" discusses the study of dissipation (loss of energy) in resonators made of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The authors use a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to investigate the mechanisms of dissipation in these materials. They find that dissipation in graphene resonators is dominated by two-level systems, while dissipation in carbon nanotube resonators is dominated by surface defects. They also show that dissipation can be reduced by using isotopically purified materials and by manipulating the shape and size of the resonators. Overall, the study provides insights into the fundamental physics of dissipation in nanoscale resonators and offers potential strategies for improving their performance in various applications."
D1-17	The recommended number of eggs to consume per week varies depending on several factors, including individual health, dietary preferences, and overall dietary patterns. It's important to note that while eggs are a nutritious food, they are also relatively high in dietary cholesterol. According to general guidelines, including those provided by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, consuming up to seven eggs per week is considered reasonable and can be part of a healthy diet for most people. However, it's important to consider the overall context of your diet, including other sources of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as your individual health goals and any specific dietary restrictions or considerations you may have.
1543	The helix-coil phase transition is a fundamental process in protein folding that remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present an ab initio theoretical study of the helix-coil transition using molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that this transition is governed by a delicate balance of enthalpic and entropic contributions, with the former dominated by hydrogen bonding and the latter by conformational entropy. We further demonstrate that the transition is strongly dependent on the sequence and length of the helical segment, with longer and more hydrophobic helices exhibiting a greater propensity to form stable helical structures. Our findings shed new light on the underlying thermodynamics of protein folding and may have important implications for the design of new foldable peptides and proteins.
2906	This research paper proposes a measure of the non-Gaussian character of a quantum state, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of complex quantum systems. We introduce a new technique based on the Wigner function to quantify the non-Gaussianity of a quantum state, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as quantum information processing and communication. Our results show that this measure is highly accurate and efficient, and it provides valuable insights into the non-classical features of quantum states. This research opens up new avenues for the study of quantum systems and has significant implications for the development of quantum technologies.
3370	"The research paper ""Field-Theoretic Simulations of Polyelectrolyte Complexation"" presents a study of the complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes using field-theoretic simulations. The authors investigate the effects of various parameters such as charge density, chain length, and salt concentration on the complexation process. They find that the complexation behavior is strongly influenced by the charge density and chain length of the polyelectrolytes, as well as the ionic strength of the solution. The simulations also reveal the formation of various types of complex structures, including spherical and cylindrical micelles, as well as interconnected networks. The study provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the complexation of polyelectrolytes and has implications for a wide range of applications in fields such as biotechnology and materials science."
3667	This research paper explores the integration of general system theory, like-quantum semantics, and fuzzy sets. The primary focus is on the application of these theories in understanding complex systems and developing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing them. The noteworthy findings suggest that the combination of these theories can enhance the understanding of complex systems and provide a more accurate representation of their behaviors and interactions. Additionally, the research highlights the potential for further development and application of these theories in various fields, including engineering, social sciences, and management.
843	Linear measures such as cross-correlation have been used successfully to determine time delays from the given processes. Such an analysis often precedes identifying possible causal relationships between the observed processes. The present study investigates the impact of a positively correlated driver whose correlation function decreases monotonically with lag on the delay estimation in a two-node acyclic network with one and two-delays. It is shown that cross-correlation analysis of the given processes can result in spurious identification of multiple delays between the driver and the dependent processes. Subsequently, delay estimation of increment process as opposed to the original process under certain implicit constraints is explored. Short-range and long-range correlated driver processes along with those of their coarse-grained counterparts are considered.
3509	"The research paper titled ""Relativistic Tennis with Photons: Demonstration of Frequency Upshifting by a Relativistic Flying Mirror through Two Colliding Laser Pulses"" explores the concept of using a relativistic flying mirror to upshift the frequency of photons. The method involves colliding two laser pulses, resulting in a relativistic flying mirror that reflects the incident photons and upshifts their frequency. The study found that the frequency upshifting effect is observable and can be used in various applications such as high-energy physics and astrophysics. Overall, the research provides a new way to manipulate photons and could lead to advancements in photonics technology."
2870	We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures, antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition, these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered structures.
985	"The research paper titled ""Lifetime Improvement in Wireless Sensor Networks via Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission"" investigates the use of collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission for improving the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. The main theme of the paper revolves around the idea of utilizing the limited energy resources of sensor nodes efficiently to prolong network lifetime. The study proposes a cooperative beamforming scheme that enables multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously, reducing power consumption and increasing the overall network lifetime. The paper presents noteworthy results that demonstrate a significant improvement in network lifetime and energy efficiency when using the proposed cooperative beamforming scheme. The study concludes that collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission can be effective techniques for improving the performance of wireless sensor networks."
D2-96	Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[19] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[20][21] Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years until disappearing in the late 15th century. The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
2942	Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered. Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength, spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of a monochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and the amplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case of a linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibility of experimental observation of the process is discussed.
2624	This research paper presents a novel approach to the fabrication of analog electronics for serial readout of silicon strip sensors. The proposed method involves the integration of a custom-designed ASIC with the sensor, thereby reducing the number of readout channels required and minimizing power consumption. The fabrication process was optimized to achieve high yield and reliability, and the resulting system was characterized for performance. The key outcomes of this study include the successful integration of the ASIC with the silicon strip sensor, the demonstration of high readout speed and efficiency, and the realization of a compact and low-power system. These findings have significant implications for the development of high-performance sensing and imaging systems in various applications, including particle physics, medical imaging, and industrial inspection.
D2-19	Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics. It involves a hypothetical scenario where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a poison mechanism. If the radioactive atom decays (a random quantum event), the poison is released, killing the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until observed, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states. This implies the cat would be simultaneously both alive and dead until someone opens the box to check. The experiment highlights the disconnect between quantum mechanical principles and our everyday experience of reality, challenging our understanding of observation.
14	A model describing the influence of torsion stress on the giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction is proposed. The wire impedance is found by means of the solution of Maxwell equations together with the Landau-Lifshitz equation, assuming a simplified spatial distribution of the magnetoelastic anisotropy induced by the torsion stress. The impedance is analyzed as a function of the external magnetic field, torsion stress and frequency. It is shown that the magnetoimpedance ratio torsion dependence has an asymmetric shape, with a sharp peak at some value of the torsion stress. The calculated field and stress dependences of the impedance are in qualitative agreement with results of the experimental study of the torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in Co-based amorphous wires.
511	In this paper we present large-scale correlated calculations of linear optical absorption spectrum of oligo-acenes containing up to seven benzene rings. For the calculations we used the Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) Hamiltonian, along with the configuration interaction (CI) technique at various levels such as the full CI (FCI), the quadruple CI (QCI) and multi-reference singles-doubles CI (MRSDCI). The role of Coulomb parameters used in the P-P-P Hamiltonian was examined by considering standard Ohno parameters, as well as a screened set of parameters. A detailed analysis of the many-body character of the important excited states contributing to the linear absorption has also been performed. The results of our calculations have been compared extensively with the theoretical work of other authors, as well as with the experiments.
891	This research paper explores the matter-wave interference in s-wave and p-wave Fermi condensates. The study aims to investigate the impact of the interaction between the two types of condensates on the interference pattern. The research involved performing experiments and numerical simulations to observe the interference pattern and analyze the results. The critical outcome of the study is that the interference pattern in p-wave Fermi condensates is significantly different from that in s-wave Fermi condensates due to the presence of a nodal plane. The study concludes that the matter-wave interference in Fermi condensates can provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum systems and can be applied in the development of new quantum technologies.
3020	This research paper explores the potential of tri-layer superlattices as a promising avenue for achieving magnetoelectric multiferroics. Multiferroics, which exhibit both magnetic and electric properties, are crucial for the development of advanced technologies such as data storage and spintronic devices. However, the search for materials that exhibit these properties at room temperature has been challenging. The use of tri-layer superlattices, which are composed of alternating layers of different materials, offers a unique approach to engineering multiferroic properties. This paper reviews the current state of research on tri-layer superlattices and their potential for achieving magnetoelectric multiferroics, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this field.
2635	We show that an unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity implies that there is a fundamental length in Nature in the sense that no operational procedure would be able to measure distances shorter than the Planck length. Furthermore we give an explicit realization of an old proposal by Anderson and Finkelstein who argued that a fundamental length in nature implies unimodular gravity. Finally, using hand waving arguments we show that a minimal length might be related to the cosmological constant which, if this scenario is realized, is time dependent.
1295	A structure with a massive group in its center and a cool expansion outflow outside is studied around the Cen A galaxy with the use of the Hubble Space Telescope observations. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the flow is dominated by the antigravity of the dark energy background. The density of dark energy in the cell is estimated to be near the global cosmological density. This agrees with our previous result from the neighborhood of the Local group. A notion of the ``Hubble cell'' is introduced as a building block of the local structure of the universe.
138	The research paper investigates the evaporation of buffer gas-thermalized anions out of a multipole rf ion trap. The primary theme of the study is to understand the behavior of anions in multipole ion traps and to determine the factors that affect their evaporation. The paper presents indispensable findings that suggest buffer gas pressure, trap depth, and anion mass affect the evaporation rate. The conclusions of the study indicate that buffer gas-thermalized anions can be efficiently evaporated out of a multipole rf ion trap, and the process can be optimized by adjusting certain parameters.
2694	We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of the standard field-theoretical treatment of vacuum energy and discuss the relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous symmetry breaking. We suggest possible extensions of the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis symmetry, in particular, its complexification till duality symmetry and discuss the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be responsible for a small observable value of this constant.
3921	The research paper presents a new approach called the Lattice Boltzmann Inverse Kinetic Method (LB-IKM) to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This method combines the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics with the inverse kinetic method for turbulence modeling. The LB-IKM approach is shown to be efficient and accurate in simulating complex fluid flows and is validated against benchmark test cases. The paper concludes that the LB-IKM approach is a promising tool for simulating turbulent flows and offers a new perspective on the relationship between turbulence and the underlying kinetic theory.
1784	We address the problem of &#64257;nding nice labellings for event structures of degree 3. We develop a minimum theory by which we prove that the labelling number of an event structure of degree 3 is bounded by a linear function of the height. The main theorem we present in this paper states that event structures of degree 3 whose causality order is a tree have a nice labelling with 3 colors. Finally, we exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3.
1512	A new algorithm has been developed to compute low Mach Numbers supercritical fluid flows. The algorithm is applied using a finite volume method based on the SIMPLER algorithm. Its main advantages are to decrease significantly the CPU time, and the possibility for supercritical fluid flow modelisation to use other discretisation methods (such as spectral methods and/or finite differences) and other algorithms such as PISO or projection. It makes it possible to solve 3D problems within reasonable CPU time even when considering complex equations of state. The algorithm is given after first a brief description of the previously existing algorithm to solve for supercritical fluids. The side and bottom heated near critical carbon dioxide filled cavity problems are respectively solved and compared to the previously obtained results.
120	This research paper investigates how neutral genetic drift can aid functional protein evolution. By analyzing mutations in the protein coding regions of genes, the study shows that neutral mutations can act as a stepping stone for beneficial mutations. These neutral mutations can accumulate over time and create a genetic background that allows for faster evolution of functional proteins when beneficial mutations occur. The findings suggest that neutral genetic drift can play an important role in shaping the evolution of complex biological systems and can help us understand how organisms adapt to changing environments. By understanding the mechanisms that drive protein evolution, we can gain insights into how to engineer proteins for specific applications in biotechnology and medicine.
1343	The extrinsic size effect in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy of ferroelectric and piezoelectric thin films on non-polar dielectric substrate is analyzed. Analytical expressions for effective piezoresponse, object transfer function components, and Rayleigh two-point resolution are obtained. These results can be broadly applied for effective piezoelectric response calculations in thin piezoelectric and ferroelectric films as well as surface polar layers e.g. in organic materials and bio-polymers. In particular, the effective piezoresponse strongly decreases with film thickness whereas the sharpness of domain stripes image increases due to the object transfer function spectrum broadening.
2361	"The research paper titled ""Adhesion forces due to nano-triboelectrification between similar materials"" aims to investigate the effect of electrostatic forces on the adhesion behavior of similar materials at the nanoscale. The study employs atomic force microscopy to measure the adhesion forces between two identical materials under different conditions, including varying relative humidity and contact time. The results reveal that the adhesion forces are significantly influenced by the accumulation of surface charges due to triboelectrification. The study concludes that the electrostatic forces play a crucial role in determining the adhesion behavior between similar materials, and a deeper understanding of these forces is essential for various applications, including nanofabrication and material science."
3715	We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.
D2-1	The Solar System faces a dramatic future over billions of years. In approximately 5-7 billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury and Venus. Earth may either be consumed or rendered uninhabitable as oceans and atmosphere evaporate. The outer planets will survive but experience significant changes in temperature and orbital dynamics. Eventually, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a white dwarf star. This white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, leaving our former solar neighborhood incredibly dim. Any surviving planets will orbit in perpetual darkness, frozen and lifeless.
2351	The paper focuses on analyzing the game-theoretic power control mechanism in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless networks with rake receivers. The authors use a large system analysis approach to investigate the behavior and performance of the power control game in such networks. They propose a new algorithm for power control that takes into account the interference caused by multiple access points in the network. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network's throughput and reduce interference compared to other existing algorithms. The authors conclude that game-theoretic power control can be an effective solution for managing interference in UWB wireless networks with rake receivers.
3345	The conformational behavior of a giant DNA mediated by condensing agents in the bulk solution has been investigated through experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, a pronounced conformational hysteresis is observed for folding and unfolding processes, by increasing and decreasing the concentration of condensing agent PEG (Polyethylene glycol), respectively. To elucidate the observed hysteresis, a semiflexible chain model is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations for the coil-globule transition. In the simulations, the hysteresis loop emerges for stiff enough chains, indicating distinct pathways for folding and unfolding processes. Also, our results show that globular state is thermodynamically more stable than coiled state in the hysteresis loop. Our findings suggest that increasing chain stiffness may reduce the chain conformations relevant to the folding pathway, which impedes the folding process.
3795	We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.
3229	"We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a Gr\""obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome."
467	We introduce a model-checking tool intended specially for the analysis of quantum information protocols. The tool incorporates an efficient representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of quantum computational tree logic (QCTL). The model-checking procedure treats quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.
3829	We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
3054	We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the performance gains offered by random network coding.
391	The paper discusses the observation and analysis of relativistic X-ray lines emitted from the inner accretion disks around black holes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of these lines in order to accurately measure the mass and spin of black holes and to study the physics of accretion disks. The paper presents observations of X-ray lines from several black holes and discusses the implications of these observations for understanding the properties of accretion disks and black holes. The authors conclude that the study of relativistic X-ray lines is an important tool for understanding the physics of black holes and accretion disks.
1882	The widely used large-scale diagonalization method using harmonic oscillator basis functions (an instance of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, also called a spectral method, configuration-interaction method, or ``exact diagonalization'' method) is systematically analyzed using results for the convergence of Hermite function series. We apply this theory to a Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional model of a quantum dot. The method is shown to converge slowly, and the non-smooth character of the interaction potential is identified as the main problem with the chosen basis, while on the other hand its important advantages are pointed out. An effective interaction obtained by a similarity transformation is proposed for improving the convergence of the diagonalization scheme, and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the improvement. Generalizations to more particles and dimensions are discussed.
917	A novel strongly nonlinear laminar metamaterial supporting new types of solitary and shock waves with impact energy mitigating capabilities is presented. It consists of steel plates with intermittent polymer toroidal rings acting as strongly nonlinear springs with large allowable strain. Their force-displacement relationship is described by the addition of two power-law relationships resulting in a solitary wave speed and width depending on the amplitude. This double nonlinearity allows splitting of an initial impulse into two separate strongly nonlinear solitary wave trains. Solitary and shock waves are observed experimentally and analyzed numerically in an assembly with Teflon o-rings.
