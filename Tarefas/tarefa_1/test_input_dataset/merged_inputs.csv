871	This research paper analyzes celestial pole offset observations within the free core nutation frequency band. The primary theme is the investigation of the accuracy and consistency of these observations. The study finds that the observations are consistent with previous research and there is evidence of a small but significant offset between the observed and predicted celestial pole positions. This has implications for the accuracy of Earth rotation models and could aid in the detection of subtle changes in the Earth's rotation.
2866	Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.
1713	This research paper investigates the impact of boundary effects on local inflation and the resulting spectrum of density perturbations. The main objectives of the study are to analyze how boundary conditions influence the behavior of scalar fields during inflation and to study the resulting effects on the spectrum of density perturbations. The paper uses numerical simulations to examine the behavior of scalar fields and the resulting perturbation spectrum in different boundary conditions. The key findings of the study suggest that boundary effects can significantly influence the spectrum of density perturbations, leading to deviations from the standard predictions of inflationary models. The study also highlights the importance of accurately accounting for boundary conditions in inflationary models to improve the accuracy of predictions for the early universe.
2387	"The research paper titled ""Spitzer Observations of Low Luminosity Isolated and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies"" explores the properties of low-luminosity isolated galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies through Spitzer Space Telescope observations. The study reveals that these types of galaxies have a lower fraction of dust and gas compared to more massive galaxies and are likely to have formed through the gradual accretion of gas over a prolonged period. The findings suggest that low-luminosity isolated and low surface brightness galaxies could be crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the interplay between dark matter, gas, and stars."
2884	We study birational maps with empty base locus defined by almost complete intersection ideals. Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality of two Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method of their calculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension two the structure of the irreducible ideals leads naturally to the calculation of Sylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 we produce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The results answer affirmatively some questions raised by D. Cox.
2119	This research paper explores the dynamics of dislocations in a crystal lattice using the Peierls-Nabarro model. The study focuses on the relief of the lattice and its impact on the movement of dislocations. By analyzing the interactions between dislocations and the lattice relief, the researchers were able to identify key factors that influence the behavior of dislocations. The study also suggests that the Peierls-Nabarro model provides an accurate representation of dislocation dynamics in crystal lattices. Overall, the research contributes to a better understanding of dislocation behavior in materials science and has potential applications in various fields such as engineering and nanotechnology.
2430	We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques. Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is estimated to be a few nK.
1644	We study thermal Casimir and quantum non-retarded Lifshitz interactions between dielectrics in general geometries. We map the calculation of the classical partition function onto a determinant which we discretize and evaluate with the help of Cholesky factorization. The quantum partition function is treated by path integral quantization of a set of interacting dipoles and reduces to a product of determinants. We compare the approximations of pairwise additivity and proximity force with our numerical methods. We propose a ``factorization approximation'' which gives rather good numerical results in the geometries that we study.
1412	This research paper investigates the relationship between the asymmetry of the Hamiltonian and the Tolman's length, which is a measure of the thermodynamic properties of curved surfaces. The study explores the impact of asymmetry on the Tolman's length in various systems, including black holes, condensed matter systems, and cosmological models. The findings suggest that the asymmetry of the Hamiltonian significantly affects the Tolman's length, leading to non-trivial consequences for the thermodynamic behavior of curved surfaces. The results have implications for the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena and may have practical applications in the design of advanced materials.
3745	We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event.
2482	This research paper presents a study on the star formation history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using old main-sequence turnoff photometry. The study covers different fields within the SMC and aims to determine the constraints on the star formation history in these areas. The data was obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope, and the photometric analysis was conducted using the DAOPHOT II and ALLFRAME software packages. The results show variations in the star formation history among the different fields, with some areas having a more extended period of star formation than others. These findings provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the SMC and contribute to our understanding of stellar populations in nearby galaxies.
950	Quantum coherence is the foundation of quantum computing, but it is easily destroyed by environmental noise. Decoherence control is a critical issue in quantum information processing. In this research paper, we propose a universal dynamical decoherence control scheme for both single-qubit and multi-qubit systems. We use a combination of dynamical decoupling and error-correcting codes to mitigate the effects of noise. Our results show that our scheme can effectively enhance the coherence of quantum systems, even in the presence of strong noise. This approach has broad applicability and can be used for a wide range of qubit systems. Our research demonstrates the promise of dynamical decoherence control for quantum information processing and paves the way for practical quantum computing applications.
1065	We calculate the radiative properties for a linear dipole-coupled chain of qubits. Using the explicit energy eigenstates of the system, we find the radiation patterns for spontaneous transitions from the one-photon eigenstates to the ground state of the system. We show that depending on the excitation of a specific atom, the radiation tends to be focused either along or perpendicular to the chain. We conclude with a derivation of the total decay rate of the one-photon eigenstates, and find the interesting result that for systems where the photon wavenumber is not much larger than the interatomic spacing, up to 94% of the eigenstates are subradiant, that is, they decay significantly slower than a single atom in isolation.
3196	This research paper explores the problem of packing toric symplectic balls, a type of geometric object, and investigates the conditions under which such packings are possible. Using mathematical tools from symplectic geometry and algebraic topology, the authors derive several important results, including the existence of a unique packing up to certain symmetries and a formula for the maximum number of balls that can be packed in a given space. These findings provide new insights into the geometry of toric symplectic manifolds and have potential applications in fields such as physics and computer science.
3854	Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.
2457	The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) is expected to revolutionize the study of pulsars, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit gamma-ray radiation. In this research paper, we investigate the potential of GLAST to discover new gamma-ray pulsars by analyzing simulated data. We find that GLAST has the capability to detect several new gamma-ray pulsars, including some with unique characteristics such as high spin-down rates or unusually high gamma-ray energies. However, we also note that the detection of new pulsars will depend on the sensitivity and observing strategy of GLAST, as well as the distribution and properties of pulsars in the galaxy. Our results highlight the importance of continued efforts to improve the detection and characterization of gamma-ray pulsars, which are valuable probes of extreme physics and cosmic evolution.
242	This research paper aims to investigate the shapes of molecular cloud cores in Orion, a star-forming region in the Milky Way. Using data from the Herschel Space Observatory, we analyze the distribution of dust emission in the cores and model their shapes using statistical methods. Our results show that the majority of the cores have elongated or irregular shapes, indicating the influence of external factors such as turbulence and magnetic fields on their formation. We also find evidence for a correlation between the shapes of the cores and their physical properties, such as mass and density. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex processes involved in the formation of stars and galaxies.
1455	This research paper examines the prospects for detecting stochastic gravitational waves using the Virgo and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LSC) interferometers. The main objective is to investigate the sensitivity of the interferometers and their potential for detecting a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Through simulations and analysis of data, the paper finds that the combined sensitivity of Virgo and LSC can significantly improve the detection prospects for stochastic gravitational waves. The paper also highlights the importance of developing advanced data analysis techniques to effectively search for stochastic backgrounds. The conclusion of the study is that with continued improvements in the interferometers and data analysis techniques, the detection of stochastic gravitational waves is an exciting prospect for the future of gravitational wave astronomy.
1332	This work considers the problem of transmitting multiple compressible sources over a network at minimum cost. The aim is to find the optimal rates at which the sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they should be transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider networks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem is complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of distributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that is exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solvers inefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled with dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradient method and the proximal bundle method.
2743	Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (SHB?PT) is a theoretical framework that describes the interactions of heavy baryons with pions. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effective field theory of SHB?PT, which includes different orders of perturbative corrections. We show that SHB?PT can accurately reproduce the experimental data for various observables, such as the mass of the ?b baryon and the decay rates of the ?b and ?b baryons. Our results demonstrate the power and versatility of SHB?PT as a tool for studying the strong interactions of heavy baryons with light mesons.
2381	This research paper focuses on the bound state calculations of the three-dimensional Yakubovsky equations with the inclusion of three-body forces. The Yakubovsky equations are widely used in nuclear physics to study the interactions between three or more nucleons. The inclusion of three-body forces is necessary to accurately model the behavior of nucleons in a system. In this study, we employ a numerical approach to solve the Yakubovsky equations with and without three-body forces. Our results show that the inclusion of three-body forces significantly affects the energy levels and wave functions of the system. We also compare our results with experimental data and other theoretical models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of nucleons in a three-body system and can contribute to the development of more accurate models in nuclear physics.
1228	"The research paper titled ""Correlation of macroscopic instability and Lyapunov times in the general three-body problem"" explores the relationship between the macroscopic instability and Lyapunov times in the three-body problem. The authors investigate the behavior of the three-body system under different initial conditions and show that the Lyapunov times provide a useful indicator of the system's stability. The study concludes that the Lyapunov times can be used to predict the onset of instability in the three-body problem, which has important implications for understanding the dynamics of celestial bodies."
2401	This research paper explores the universal features of dimensional reduction schemes that arise from the breaking of general covariance. The paper investigates the relationship between the dimensional reduction schemes and the breaking of general covariance, which is a fundamental concept in modern physics. The study uses analytical and numerical methods to investigate the effects of breaking general covariance on the dimensional reduction schemes. The results show that there are universal features of dimensional reduction schemes that arise from the breaking of general covariance. The paper concludes that these universal features offer insights into the underlying physics of dimensional reduction schemes and can be used to develop new theories and models in physics. Overall, this research paper contributes to the understanding of the fundamental principles of physics and provides a foundation for further research in this area.
3625	It has long been known that once you cross the event horizon of a black hole, your destiny lies at the central singularity, irrespective of what you do. Furthermore, your demise will occur in a finite amount of proper time. In this paper, the use of rockets in extending the amount of time before the collision with the central singularity is examined. In general, the use of such rockets can increase your remaining time, but only up to a maximum value; this is at odds with the ``more you struggle, the less time you have'' statement that is sometimes discussed in relation to black holes. The derived equations are simple to solve numerically and the framework can be employed as a teaching tool for general relativity.
3477	This research paper presents high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging of mesoscopic graphene sheets on an insulating surface. The study demonstrates the ability to image graphene sheets with atomic resolution and high spatial resolution, allowing for detailed analysis of the graphene's morphology and electronic properties. The results show that the graphene sheets exhibit a high degree of structural stability and that their electronic properties are strongly influenced by the underlying insulating surface. The study provides new insights into the behavior of mesoscopic graphene sheets and highlights the potential of STM as a powerful tool for investigating the properties of two-dimensional materials. These findings have important implications for the development of novel graphene-based electronic devices and could contribute to the advancement of nanotechnology.
335	The description of resources in game semantics has never achieved the simplicity and precision of linear logic, because of a misleading conception: the belief that linear logic is more primitive than game semantics. We advocate instead the contrary: that game semantics is conceptually more primitive than linear logic. Starting from this revised point of view, we design a categorical model of resources in game semantics, and construct an arena game model where the usual notion of bracketing is extended to multi- bracketing in order to capture various resource policies: linear, af&#64257;ne and exponential.
391	The paper discusses the observation and analysis of relativistic X-ray lines emitted from the inner accretion disks around black holes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of these lines in order to accurately measure the mass and spin of black holes and to study the physics of accretion disks. The paper presents observations of X-ray lines from several black holes and discusses the implications of these observations for understanding the properties of accretion disks and black holes. The authors conclude that the study of relativistic X-ray lines is an important tool for understanding the physics of black holes and accretion disks.
579	This research paper investigates the effect of decoherence on the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well potential. The study focuses on the rapid change of the potential and the resulting decoherence effects on the condensates. The results of the study show that the decoherence significantly affects the dynamics of the condensates, leading to the localization of the condensate in one of the wells and the loss of coherence between the two wells. The study concludes that controlling decoherence effects is crucial in manipulating the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in double-well potentials for potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation.
2150	Although it is widely accepted that `no-broadcasting' -- the nonclonability of quantum information -- is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, an impossibility theorem for the broadcasting of general density matrices has not yet been formulated. In this paper, we present a general proof for the no-broadcasting theorem, which applies to arbitrary density matrices. The proof relies on entropic considerations, and as such can also be directly linked to its classical counterpart, which applies to probabilistic distributions of statistical ensembles.
1166	The expansion rate of `Intermediate inflation' lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution. Present study of `Intermediate inflation' reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution, leading to late time acceleration. The corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some non-canonical form of kinetic term. Thus the so called Intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic de-Sitter expansion.
2104	Recent development of a hydrodynamic model is discussed by putting an emphasis on realistic treatment of the early and late stages in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model, which incorporates a hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma with a kinetic approach of hadron cascades, is applied to analysis of elliptic flow data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energy. It is predicted that the elliptic flow parameter based on the hybrid model increases with the collision energy up to the Large Hadron Collider energy.
72	"The research paper titled ""An Analysis of the Shapes of Interstellar Extinction Curves. V. The IR-Through-UV Curve Morphology"" focuses on analyzing the shapes of interstellar extinction curves. The primary theme of this research is to study the morphology of IR-through-UV extinction curves and investigate their variations in different environments. The research findings suggest that the shape of the extinction curve depends on the physical properties of the interstellar environment, such as the size distribution of dust grains and the abundance of heavy elements. The conclusions drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the nature and evolution of interstellar dust and the interstellar medium."
3126	This research paper investigates the invariants of triangular Lie algebras, a special class of Lie algebras with a triangular decomposition. The main objective of this study is to identify and classify the invariants of such Lie algebras, which are essential for understanding the algebraic structures of various physical systems. We explore the relationship between the Lie algebra structure and its invariants, and prove that for triangular Lie algebras, these invariants are determined by the structure constants of the algebra. We also establish the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial invariants and provide explicit examples of such invariants. Our findings suggest that the invariants of triangular Lie algebras play a crucial role in the study of Lie algebraic structures and their applications in physics and other fields.
1336	This research paper focuses on studying the scattering of waves by small impedance particles in a medium. The study uses the boundary element method to analyze the scattering process and to investigate the effects of particle size and composition on the scattered field. The main outcome of the study is the observation of resonance peaks in the scattered field, which are dependent on the size and composition of the particles. The conclusions of the study provide insights into the behavior of waves in heterogeneous media and have potential applications in fields such as medical imaging and geophysics.
3757	Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices.
2137	Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades. Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially. Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.
1200	We show that the category of projective modules over a graded commutative ring admits a triangulation with respect to module suspension if and only if the ring is a finite product of graded fields and exterior algebras on one generator over a graded field (with a unit in the appropriate degree). We also classify the ungraded commutative rings for which the category of projective modules admits a triangulation with respect to the identity suspension. Applications to two analogues of the generating hypothesis in algebraic topology are given, and we translate our results into the setting of modules over a symmetric ring spectrum or S-algebra.
116	This research paper investigates two distinct scenarios of breaking chaotic phase synchronization in coupled chaotic systems. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the two scenarios are characterized by different dynamical behaviors and bifurcation structures. Specifically, we find that the first scenario involves a gradual transition to a desynchronized state, while the second scenario exhibits a sudden transition to a new synchronized state. Our results provide insight into the complex dynamics of coupled chaotic systems and may have implications for various applications in physics, engineering, and biology.
2510	Four-body interaction plays an important role in many-body systems, and it can exhibit interesting phase transition behaviors. Historically it was the need to efficiently simulate quantum systems that lead the idea of a quantum computer. In this Letter, we report the experimental demonstration of a four-body interaction in a four- qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor. The strongly modulating pulse is used to implement spin selective excitation. The results show a good agreement between theory and experiment.
3233	We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates 0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously difficult to achieve.
3880	"The research paper titled ""Epitaxial graphene"" discusses the growth and properties of graphene on various substrates using the epitaxial method. The paper highlights the advantages of epitaxial graphene, including high quality, large area, and tunable electronic properties. The paper also discusses the challenges and current progress in the growth of epitaxial graphene on different substrates. The researchers conclude that epitaxial graphene is a promising material for various applications, including electronics, energy devices, and sensors. However, further research is needed to optimize the growth and properties of epitaxial graphene for practical applications."
1411	Using the canonical transformation of the order parameter which restores the Ising symmetry of the Hamiltonian we derive the expression for the Tolman length as a sum of two terms. One of them is the term generated by the fluctuations of the order parameter the other one is due to the entropy. The leading singular behavior of the Tolman length near the critical point is analyzed. The obtained results are in correspondence with that of M.A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{98} 035702 (2007).
3255	The research paper explores the theory of integrable lattices and their sublattices. In particular, it focuses on the B-quadrilateral lattice and its relation to self-adjoint schemes on the triangular and honeycomb lattices. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties and symmetries of these lattices, and derives several important results concerning their integrability and the existence of special types of solutions. The main conclusion of the paper is that the B-quadrilateral lattice and its sublattices are important objects of study in the theory of integrable systems, and can be used to derive new insights into the properties of lattice models in physics and mathematics.
2213	This research paper presents simulations of the aging and plastic deformation of polymer glasses. The simulations show that polymer glasses undergo structural rearrangements during aging, leading to an increase in mechanical properties. Plastic deformation is also observed to occur via the formation of shear bands. The simulations suggest that the mechanical behavior of polymer glasses is strongly influenced by the aging process and the resulting structural changes. Noteworthy findings include the observation of a transition from brittle to ductile behavior with increasing aging time and the dependence of plastic deformation on the strain rate. Overall, the simulations provide insights into the complex mechanical behavior of polymer glasses and can help guide the design of more durable and reliable materials.
3224	This research paper explores the challenges and potential solutions for finding fast paths in large-scale dynamic road networks. With the exponential growth of urban populations and increasing demand for efficient transportation, it has become critical to develop algorithms that can quickly calculate the fastest routes in dynamic road networks. The paper analyzes existing methods for fast pathfinding and proposes a novel approach that utilizes a combination of heuristics, machine learning, and real-time data processing. The proposed method is tested on real-world datasets and compared with existing approaches, demonstrating superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of more efficient transportation systems and could lead to improvements in traffic management and congestion reduction.
2856	This research paper focuses on the Genetic Programming Collaboration Network (GPCN) and its communities. The GPCN is a network of researchers who collaborate to advance the field of genetic programming through the exchange of ideas, research, and resources. The paper explores the structure of the GPCN, including its various communities, and highlights the key findings from an analysis of the network's collaboration patterns. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the future of genetic programming research and collaboration. The outcomes of this research suggest that the GPCN is a valuable resource for researchers in the field and that collaboration within the network is essential for advancing the field of genetic programming.
1618	Melting of a bicrystal along the grain boundary is discussed. A triple junction plays a crucial role in the velocity selection problem in this case. In some range of the parameters an entirely analytical solution of this problem is given. This allows to present a transparent picture of the structure of the selection theory. We also discuss the selection problem in the case of the growth of a ``eutectoid dendrite'' where a triple junction is present because three phases are involved in the eutectoid reaction.
268	We study the multi-spin entanglement for the 1D anisotropic XY model concentrating on the simplest case of three-spin entanglement. As compared to the pairwise entanglement, three-party quantum correlations have a longer range and they are more robust on increasing the temperature. We find regions of the phase diagram of the system where bound entanglement occurs, both at zero and finite temperature. Bound entanglement in the ground state can be obtained by tuning the magnetic field. Thermal bound entanglement emerges naturally due to the effect of temperature on the free ground state entanglement.
3373	Using three different energy-momentum complexes, the Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, and Papapetrou prescriptions, we calculate the energy of an electrically charged black hole exact solution with a self-interacting, minimally-coupled scalar field and the asymptotic region locally an Anti-deSitter spacetime. Writing the metric in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates, we demonstrate that this metric belongs to the Kerr-Schild class of solutions. Applying each of the three energy-momentum prescriptions and comparing the results, we find consistency among these complexes, suggesting their utility as localized measures of energy.
1300	This research paper explores the physics of polarons in optical lattices. A polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between a moving charged particle and its surrounding medium. Optical lattices are periodic structures created by interfering laser beams, which trap and manipulate atoms to form a lattice-like structure. By combining these two systems, we can investigate the behavior of polarons in a controlled environment. In this paper, we review the theoretical background of polarons and optical lattices, and discuss recent experimental observations of polarons in optical lattices. We also explore the potential applications of these systems in quantum computing and quantum simulation. Overall, this paper highlights the exciting possibilities for studying and manipulating polarons in optical lattices and sheds light on the fundamental physics underlying these systems.
1167	This research paper investigates the cosmological evolution of the Universe, focusing on the transition between intermediate inflation and late-time acceleration. The study considers different inflationary scenarios and examines their impact on the evolution of the Universe. The paper also explores the consequences of different gravitational models, such as modified gravity, on the cosmological evolution. The analysis is based on observational data from the cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale structures, and type Ia supernovae. The research aims to provide insights into the nature of the Universe and contribute to the understanding of its evolution. The results suggest that intermediate inflation and late-time acceleration are both viable scenarios, and the choice between them depends on the specific inflationary model and the gravitational theory considered.
1795	We investigate the mixing-demixing transition and the collapse in a quasi-two-dimensional degenerate boson-fermion mixture (DBFM) with a bosonic vortex. We solve numerically a quantum-hydrodynamic model based on a new density functional which accurately takes into account the dimensional crossover. It is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion, a mixed state of DBFM could turn into a demixed state. The system collapses for interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and demixed states of a DBFM could be experimentally realized by varying an external magnetic field near a boson-fermion Feshbach resonance, which will result in a continuous variation of interspecies interaction.
3986	Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
2901	"The abstract of the research paper titled ""Reply to 'Comment on 'Heavy element production in inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis'"" highlights the response of the authors to criticisms raised in the comment regarding their previous research. The authors defend their findings and argue that the inhomogeneity of the early universe played a crucial role in the production of heavy elements. They emphasize that their calculations are consistent with observational data and provide a better understanding of the nucleosynthesis process. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering inhomogeneity in future studies of big bang nucleosynthesis."
275	"The research paper titled ""Chirality and Equilibrium Biopolymer Bundles"" investigates the role of chirality in the formation and stability of biopolymer bundles. The primary theme of the research is to explore how the chirality of individual biopolymers affects their ability to assemble into bundles and maintain equilibrium. The study employs computer simulations and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that chirality plays a crucial role in determining the stability of biopolymer bundles. The research concludes that chirality is an indispensable factor in the self-assembly of biopolymer bundles and may have important implications for understanding the structure and function of biological systems."
1897	The research paper explores the current-induced switching of a single-molecule magnet with an arbitrary oriented easy axis. The study utilizes a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to investigate the behavior of the single-molecule magnet under the influence of an external electric current. The primary focus of the research is to understand the mechanisms behind the switching behavior of the magnet and to determine the factors that influence the switchability of the magnet. The study reveals that the switching behavior of the magnet is highly dependent on the orientation of the easy axis and the strength of the external current. The findings of the study have significant implications for the development of next-generation molecular electronics and spintronics devices.
1335	The theory of acoustic wave scattering by many small bodies is developed for bodies with impedance boundary condition. It is shown that if one embeds many small particles in a bounded domain, filled with a known material, then one can create a new material with the properties very different from the properties of the original material. Moreover, these very different properties occur although the total volume of the embedded small particles is negligible compared with the volume of the original material.
3733	We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
468	This research paper presents QMC, a model checker specifically designed for quantum systems. The main objective of this work is to develop a tool that can efficiently verify the correctness of quantum protocols and algorithms. QMC is based on a symbolic representation of quantum states and operations, and it supports various types of specifications, including linear-time temporal logic (LTL) and probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL). The paper also describes the implementation of QMC and presents experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness in verifying quantum protocols and algorithms. The key findings of this work show that QMC is a promising tool for verifying quantum systems, and it can handle larger quantum circuits than existing model checkers. Overall, this paper demonstrates that model checking can be a useful technique for ensuring the correctness of quantum systems.
400	This research paper investigates the fundamental limits to position determination by concentration gradients. The use of concentration gradients has shown promising results in various applications, including biomedicine and environmental monitoring. However, the accuracy of position determination is limited by several factors, including the diffusion of particles and the sensitivity of sensors. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of these limitations, taking into account the properties of the gradient, the sensing mechanism, and the surrounding environment. The results show that the achievable accuracy is highly dependent on the specific application and the design parameters. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the development of more efficient and reliable concentration gradient-based position determination systems.
47	"The research paper titled ""An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels"" focuses on the tradeoff between energy efficiency and channel estimation accuracy in wireless communication systems. The paper proposes a new training method that optimizes the energy efficiency of channel estimation while maintaining a satisfactory level of accuracy.The key findings of the research are that traditional training methods consume a significant amount of energy and do not necessarily result in the highest accuracy. The proposed method reduces energy consumption by adjusting the number of pilot symbols transmitted, while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy.The paper concludes that the proposed method can significantly improve the energy efficiency of wireless communication systems, especially in scenarios where energy is a limiting factor. It also highlights the importance of considering energy efficiency in the design of wireless communication systems."
3630	The research paper discusses the outburst of the X-ray transient H 1743-322 in 2003 and compares it to the black hole microquasar XTE J1550-564. The authors analyze the X-ray and radio properties of both objects during their outbursts and find that H 1743-322 had a longer duration and lower peak luminosity than XTE J1550-564. They also suggest that the differences in the outburst properties may be due to the different accretion rates and magnetic field strengths of the black holes. Overall, the paper provides insight into the behavior of black holes during outbursts and highlights the importance of studying multiple objects to understand the underlying physics.
3230	This research paper explores the use of Markov basis and Groebner basis techniques in testing independence in group-wise selections. The authors examine a specific configuration, the Segre-Veronese configuration, and show that its Markov basis can be used to construct a test for independence in group-wise selections. They also show that the Groebner basis of the same configuration can be used to construct a different test with similar properties. The authors conclude that these techniques provide a powerful tool for testing independence in complex situations.
4034	This research paper focuses on the properties of the scales of nuclei and nuclear matter. The primary theme is the investigation of the few-body systems of nuclei and their behavior under different conditions. The significant findings include the identification of various types of nuclear matter and the discovery of the nuclear halo. The conclusions drawn from this research suggest that the few-body systems of nuclei and nuclear matter play a critical role in understanding the nature of nuclear physics and the behavior of matter at the atomic level.
1718	Feedback from black hole activity is widely believed to play a key role in regulating star formation and black hole growth. A long-standing issue is the relation between the star formation and fueling the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation rates in circumnuclear regions (CNRs). Comparing with the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law, we find that the star formation rates in CNRs of most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to explain the suppressed star formation rates.
1347	Recent studies of dense clumps/cores in a number of regions of low-mass star formation have shown that the mass distribution of these clumps closely resembles the initial mass function (IMF) of field stars. One possible interpretation of these observations is that we are witnessing the fragmentation of the clouds into the IMF, and the observed clumps are bound pre-stellar cores. In this paper, we highlight a potential difficulty in this interpretation, namely that clumps of varying mass are likely to have systematically varying lifetimes. This timescale problem can effectively destroy the similarity bewteen the clump and stellar mass functions, such that a stellar-like clump mass function (CMF) results in a much steeper stellar IMF. We also discuss some ways in which this problem may be avoided.
2320	This paper explores the effect of the spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers. By using numerical simulations, the researchers found that spin-flips can significantly impact the gravitational wave signature of the merger. The direction and magnitude of the spins of the black holes can alter the timing and amplitude of the gravitational waves, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of the data if not properly accounted for. The study emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling the spins of the black holes in future gravitational wave observations of supermassive black hole mergers.
2774	"This research paper titled ""Outstanding Issues in Our Understanding of L, T, and Y Dwarfs"" highlights the challenges and limitations in our current knowledge and understanding of L, T, and Y dwarfs.

The authors discuss the unresolved issues in the characterization of these objects, such as their atmospheric properties, composition, and physical processes. They also highlight the potential of future facilities and instruments to advance our understanding of L, T, and Y dwarfs. The conclusions emphasize the need for continued research and collaboration among astronomers to address the outstanding issues in our knowledge of these fascinating celestial objects."
3676	We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.
1719	This research paper investigates the suppression of star formation in the circumnuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The study finds that Seyfert galaxies with stronger nuclear activity exhibit lower star formation rates and that this suppression is likely due to the presence of active galactic nuclei. Additionally, the study suggests that the suppression of star formation in the circumnuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies may play a role in the evolution of these galaxies.
3072	This research paper assesses the availability of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems based on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles, using a case study approach. The study analyzed the logfiles of a production server over a period of six months and identified various types of system failures. The analysis revealed that the majority of the system failures were caused by hardware issues and software bugs. The study also discussed the limitations of relying solely on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles for availability assessment and suggested the use of additional monitoring tools for a more comprehensive approach. The findings of this study can be useful for system administrators and IT professionals in identifying potential system failures and improving the overall availability of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems.
2558	We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the Planck length.
1906	We prove well-posedness of the initial value problem for the Einstein equations for spatially-homogeneous cosmologies with data at an isotropic cosmological singularity, for which the matter content is either a cosmological constant with collisionless particles of a single mass (possibly zero) or a cosmological constant with a perfect fluid having the radiation equation of state. In both cases, with a positive cosmological constant, these solutions, except possibly for Bianchi-type-IX, will expand forever, and be geodesically-complete into the future.
1035	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of spontaneous chirality, wherein chiral structures spontaneously form without the presence of any chiral molecules or external stimuli. The study focuses on the role of long-range electrostatic forces in driving the formation of these structures. The research utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to model systems of charged particles and study the emergence of chirality. The results demonstrate that long-range electrostatic forces can indeed drive the spontaneous formation of chiral structures, and that the strength of the electrostatic interactions plays a critical role in determining the degree of chirality observed. The findings have important implications for understanding the emergence of chirality in biological systems and the design of new materials with chiral properties.
1047	"The electronic structure of nanowires in contact with metallic electrodes of experimentally relevant sizes is calculated by incorporating the electrostatic polarization potential into the atomistic single particle Schr\""odinger equation. We show that the presence of an electrode produces localized electron/hole states near the electrode, a phenomenon only exhibited in nanostructures and overlooked in the past. This phenomenon will have profound implications on electron transport in such nanosystems. We calculate several electrode/nanowire geometries, with varying contact depths and nanowire radii. We demonstrate the change in the band gap of up to 0.5 eV in 3 nm diameter CdSe nanowires and calculate the magnitude of the applied electric field necessary to overcome the localization."
2081	This research paper presents a holographic formula for Q-curvature, a geometric quantity that characterizes the conformal geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The formula is derived using the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates conformal field theories to gravitational theories in anti-de Sitter space. The paper demonstrates that the holographic formula is consistent with known results for Q-curvature in two and four dimensions, and provides new insights into the behavior of Q-curvature in higher dimensions. Notably, the formula suggests that Q-curvature in even dimensions is related to the renormalized volume of the conformal boundary, while in odd dimensions it is related to the integral of the Weyl tensor.
2670	We describe a novel approach to prepare, detect and characterize magnetic quantum phases in ultra-cold spinor atoms loaded in optical superlattices. Our technique makes use of singlet-triplet spin manipulations in an array of isolated double well potentials in analogy to recently demonstrated quantum control in semiconductor quantum dots. We also discuss the many-body singlet-triplet spin dynamics arising from coherent coupling between nearest neighbor double wells and derive an effective description for such system. We use it to study the generation of complex magnetic states by adiabatic and non-equilibrium dynamics.
2269	"The research paper titled ""Nonlocal interactions versus viscosity in turbulence"" investigates the relative importance of nonlocal interactions and viscosity in turbulent flows. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, the study shows that nonlocal interactions play a dominant role in the energy transfer within the turbulent flow at large scales, while viscosity becomes significant only at small scales. The researchers also demonstrate that the nonlocal interactions can lead to the emergence of coherent structures in the flow, which can have a significant impact on the overall behavior of the system. These findings have important implications for our understanding of turbulence and for the development of new models and methods for predicting and controlling turbulent flows."
3715	We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.
3002	This research paper explores the dependence of the critical adsorption point for self-avoiding walks on surface and sequence disorders when interacting with a planar surface. Various simulation techniques were used to study the effects of surface and sequence disorders on the adsorption behavior of self-avoiding walks. The results indicate that the critical adsorption point is influenced by the degree of surface and sequence disorders. The study provides insights into the adsorption behavior of self-avoiding walks and can be useful in various fields such as polymer physics and biophysics.
3819	The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.
1248	This research paper presents an ab initio density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic structure of barium titanate (BaTiO3). The study investigates the electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and electronic charge density distribution of BaTiO3. The results show that BaTiO3 has a direct band gap of 3.41 eV, and the electronic charge density is mainly distributed between the Ti and O atoms. The study also confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3, which can significantly affect its electronic properties. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of BaTiO3 and its potential applications in electronic devices.
669	We predict cascade hypernuclear production spectra expected in the forthcoming J-PARC experiment. In the Green's function method of the distorted wave impulse wave approximation with the local optimal Fermi averaging t-matrix, we can describe the Xi production spectra in the continuum and bound state region reasonably well. Predictions to the high resonlution spectra at J-PARC suggest hat we should observe Xi bound state peak structure in (K-,K+) spectra in light nuclear targets such as 12C and 27Al.
897	This research paper aims to investigate and propose a reduced bias nonparametric approach for estimating lifetime density and hazard functions. Traditional nonparametric methods often suffer from high bias due to the use of fixed bandwidth or kernel functions. The proposed method employs adaptive bandwidth selection and an optimized kernel function to reduce the bias while maintaining estimation efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real-world applications. The results suggest that the reduced bias nonparametric approach can provide more accurate and reliable estimates of lifetime density and hazard functions, which can have significant implications for various fields such as reliability engineering, medical research, and finance.
543	When looking for a solution, deterministic methods have the enormous advantage that they do find global optima. Unfortunately, they are very CPU-intensive, and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore. In order to get a result, one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms, that sample the search space without exploring it thoroughly. Such algorithms can find very good results, without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached; but there is often no other choice than using them. This chapter is a short introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization.
795	We investigate dynamical systems characterized by a time series of distinct semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth. Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.
2032	The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is a well-known phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where the frequent measurements of a system can prevent it from evolving. However, recent studies have suggested the possibility of a Total Quantum Zeno Effect (TQZE), where the system remains in its initial state indefinitely, even without continuous measurements. In this paper, we explore the concept of TQZE beyond the traditional Zeno time limit and investigate the conditions under which it can occur. We demonstrate that TQZE can be achieved by manipulating the system-environment interaction and by employing different measurement strategies. Our findings have significant implications for quantum information processing and control, where TQZE can be exploited to enhance the stability and coherence of quantum systems.
3636	The paper presents a novel approach for designing parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) using Kinetostatic Performance Criteria (KPC) as the basis for design optimization. The KPC approach considers the dynamic performance of the machine tool, such as its stiffness, accuracy, and workspace, in addition to its kinematic performance. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the KPC approach through a case study involving the design of a 5-axis PKMT. The results show that the KPC approach can significantly improve the performance of PKMTs compared to traditional design approaches. The paper concludes that the KPC approach can provide a valuable tool for the design and optimization of PKMTs in various applications.
1756	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons with a positively defined metric in internal space in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are also emphasized.
3425	This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves warping the prototype template to match the localized objects. The algorithm is presented along with the results of four example applications using MRI, x-ray and ultrasound images.
1456	We study a relaxed formulation of the quasistatic evolution problem in the context of small strain associative elastoplasticity with softening. The relaxation takes place in spaces of generalized Young measures. The notion of solution is characterized by the following properties: global stability at each time and energy balance on each time interval. An example developed in detail compares the solutions obtained by this method with the ones provided by a vanishing viscosity approximation, and shows that only the latter capture a decreasing branch in the stress-strain response.
1554	This research paper explores the relationship between modules over operads and functors, focusing on the structure of these objects and their interactions. Operads are algebraic structures that capture the notion of composition in various mathematical contexts, while functors are transformations between categories that preserve structure. This paper examines how modules over operads and functors relate to one another, including the construction of free modules and the algebraic properties of these objects. The paper also explores applications of these concepts in areas such as algebraic topology and homological algebra. Overall, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the connections between operads, functors, and their associated modules, shedding light on the fundamental algebraic structures underlying many branches of mathematics.
2021	Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and second row of the periodic table is obtained.
2968	Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic junctions.
3546	Luttinger liquid behavior of one-dimensional correlated electron systems is characterized by power-law scaling of a variety of physical observables with exponents determined by a single interaction dependent parameter K. We suggest a setup to study Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires which allows to determine K from two independent measurements: resonant transport through a quantum dot embedded in the wire and the charge on the dot. Consistency of the two measured values of K for a single probe would provide strong experimental evidence for the Luttinger liquid paradigm.
2963	This research paper investigates the relationship between incommensurability and the unconventional superconductor to insulator transition in the Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of incommensurate charge order can lead to the suppression of superconductivity and the emergence of an insulating phase in the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we show that the bond-charge interaction plays a crucial role in the formation of incommensurate charge order and contributes to the suppression of superconductivity. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between charge order, superconductivity, and insulating behavior in strongly correlated electron systems.
D2-93	Metabolic engineering is not another form of classic manipulation of intermediary metabolism; rather, it is the purposeful design of metabolic networks. The metabolic engineering approach examines biochemical reactions in their entirety, rather than individually, and is concerned with the construction of novel pathways, the thermodynamic feasibility of pathways, and the location of limiting branch-point(s) and enzymatic reaction(s) in a reaction network. The ultimate goal is the construction of strains with superior yield and productivity obtained through a convergent evolutionary process. Progress has been made toward this objective within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis through the development of methodologies for the experimental determination of elasticities and flux control coefficients.
3215	It is shown that a graphene ribbon, a ballistic strip of carbon monolayer, may serve as a quantum wire whose electronic properties can be continuously and reversibly controlled by an externally applied transverse voltage. The electron bands of armchair-edge ribbons undergo dramatic transformations: The Fermi surface fractures, Fermi velocity and effective mass change sign, and excitation gaps are reduced by the transverse field. These effects are manifest in the conductance plateaus, van Hove singularities, thermopower, and activated transport. The control over one-dimensional bands may help enhance effects of electron correlations, and be utilized in device applications.
D2-12	Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and immune function, primarily by regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Humans can synthesize vitamin D through skin exposure to sunlight (UVB rays), but factors like limited sun exposure, darker skin, age, and geographic location can reduce production. The recommended daily intake varies by age and health status. For most adults, 600-800 IU (15-20 µg) per day is sufficient, though some individuals may require higher doses, especially if deficient. Dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and weakened immunity, making adequate vitamin D intake crucial for overall health and well-being. Regular checks can ensure optimal levels.
2155	This research paper explores the use of generalized linear Schur models (GLSMs) for partial flag manifolds. The main focus of the study is to investigate the properties of GLSMs for these manifolds, including their rank and stability. The paper presents relevant results and conclusions, such as the existence of a unique GLSM for each partial flag manifold and the relationship between GLSMs and Schubert calculus. Additionally, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of GLSMs in studying geometric properties of partial flag manifolds. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of GLSMs and their applications in algebraic geometry.
D2-7	Spermidine synthases are essential enzymes that function as aminopropyltransferases, transferring aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structurally, these enzymes contain a SAM-MT fold and typically form homodimers. The mechanism follows an SN2 reaction pathway where spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine The human spermidine synthase is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor. Crystal structures have been solved at high resolution, including the putrescine aminopropyltransferase from Thermotoga maritima at 1.5 Å . These structural studies, combined with biochemical analyses of enzymes from various organisms, have provided detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of this important class of enzymes.

The primary theme of the research is to understand the electronic structure and dynamics of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions. The study finds that the polaronic effects are enhanced in strongly correlated systems, leading to a significant change in the spectral properties of the material. The Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method is shown to be a powerful tool for investigating the polaronic effects in strongly correlated systems. The research provides important insights into the behavior of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions, which can be useful for designing new materials with desired electronic properties.
3193	The effect of bias voltages on the statistical properties of rough surfaces has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique and its stochastic analysis. We have characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a rough surface by the stochastic parameters such as roughness exponent, level crossing, and drift and diffusion coefficients as a function of the applied bias voltage. It is shown that these statistical as well as microstructural parameters can also explain the macroscopic property of a surface. Furthermore, the tip convolution effect on the stochastic parameters has been examined.
3185	This research paper focuses on simulating CCD images of elliptical galaxies using a custom software package. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the effects of different galactic parameters on the resulting images, including the galaxy's size, ellipticity, and orientation. The significant findings of the study include the development of a method for accurately reproducing the observed properties of elliptical galaxies in CCD images, and the identification of specific combinations of galactic parameters that produce particularly realistic and informative images. The study concludes that simulations of CCD images can provide valuable insights into the physical properties of elliptical galaxies, and offers a promising avenue for future research in this area.
3660	We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.
1971	The Standard Model of particle physics has been successfully used to predict and explain a wide range of phenomena, but some aspects of it remain untested. This research paper explores the potential for precision measurements of the weak charges of quarks to test the Standard Model. The authors describe the theoretical framework and experimental techniques involved in such measurements, and present results from previous experiments that provide evidence for the Standard Model's predictions. The paper concludes that further precision measurements of weak charges could provide valuable insights into the nature of the Standard Model and help uncover new physics beyond it.
3144	We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.
923	Hypermultiplet couplings in type IIA string theory on a Calabi-Yau space can be quantum corrected by D2-brane instantons wrapping special Lagrangian cycles. On the other hand, hypermultiplet couplings in the heterotic string on a K3 surface are corrected by world-sheet instantons wrapping curves. In a class of examples, we relate these two sets of instanton corrections. We first present an analogue of the c-map for the heterotic string via a dual flux compactification of M-theory. Using this duality, we propose two ways of capturing quantum corrections to hypermultiplets. We then use the orientifold limit of certain F-theory compactifications to relate curves in K3 to special Lagrangians in dual type IIA compactifications. We conclude with some results from perturbative string theory for hypermultiplet F-terms and a conjecture about the topology of brane instantons.
3891	"Moore introduced a class of real-valued ""recursive"" functions by analogy with Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his ""primitive recursive"" functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog computation, fails."
1414	This research paper explores the formation of ultracold heteronuclear dimers in the presence of electric fields. The study investigates the behavior of two distinct atoms, and their interaction in an electric field to form a heteronuclear dimer. The researchers employed a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental measurements to investigate the formation and stability of these dimers. The study also examines the role of external electric fields in controlling the formation and stability of the heteronuclear dimers. The research findings indicate that external electric fields can have a significant impact on the formation and stability of these ultracold heteronuclear dimers. The study provides important insights into the fundamental physics of ultracold molecules and their potential applications in a range of fields, including quantum simulation, precision measurement, and quantum information processing.
1275	This research paper presents the findings of a multi-epoch VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) study of the radio galaxy 3C 66A. The central focus of the study was to investigate the variability and structural changes in the jet of 3C 66A over a period of six years. The results show that the jet underwent significant morphological changes, including the appearance of a new component and the disappearance of an existing component. These findings suggest that the variability in 3C 66A is likely due to the propagation of shocks along the jet. The study highlights the importance of multi-epoch VLBA observations in understanding the dynamics of active galactic nuclei.
3904	A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.
17	This research paper presents a new determination of the extragalactic background of diffuse gamma rays that takes into account the potential contributions from dark matter annihilation. Using a combination of observational data and theoretical modeling, we calculate the expected gamma ray flux from dark matter annihilation in the intergalactic medium and include it in our analysis. Our results indicate that the contribution from dark matter annihilation is significant and cannot be ignored when determining the extragalactic background of diffuse gamma rays. This new determination has important implications for our understanding of the nature and distribution of dark matter in the universe.
256	"The research paper titled ""Immunohistochemical pitfalls in the demonstration of insulin-degrading enzyme in normal and neoplastic human tissues"" aims to identify and overcome the challenges in detecting insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in human tissues using immunohistochemistry. Through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic human tissues, the study reveals that the detection of IDE using immunohistochemistry is challenging due to its low expression levels and cross-reactivity with other proteins. The authors suggest using multiple antibodies and optimizing staining protocols to improve the detection of IDE in human tissues. The study concludes that caution should be exercised when interpreting IDE immunostaining results, and further research is needed to validate the specificity and sensitivity of different IDE antibodies."
3657	"Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity."
1938	We report on the observation of enhanced microwave transmission through quasi-periodic hole arrays in metal films. The fraction of transmitted light reaches 50% in a self-standing metal film and approaches 90% when the film is sandwiched between thin dielectric slabs, while the holes occupy only 10% of the sample area. The maximum transmission is accompanied by zero phase change, rendering the film almost 'invisible' over a wide frequency range. The extraordinary transmission phenomenon is interpreted in terms of resonances in the self-consistent interaction between holes, which are represented by effective electric and magnetic dipoles.
383	Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the universe, consisting of hundreds or thousands of galaxies held together by gravity. The study of these clusters is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the universe. However, accurately measuring the physical properties of these clusters is challenging due to the complexity of their interactions. In particular, the fitting of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect models for galaxy clusters, known as the Beta-Model Problem, has yielded conflicting results. This research paper aims to explore and address the incompatibility of these models and propose a solution for more accurate measurements of galaxy cluster properties. The paper will review current research and present new findings on the nature of the Beta-Model Problem, discussing the implications for the study of galaxy clusters and the broader field of astrophysics.
525	Bose-Einstein coalescence of independent photons at the surface of a beam splitter is the physical process that allows linear optical quantum gates to be built. When distinct parametric down-conversion events are used as an independent photon source, distinguishability arises form the energy correlation of each photon with its twin. We find that increasing the pump bandwidth may help in improving the visibility of non-classical interference and reaching a level of near perfect indistinguishability. PACS: 03.67.Mn, 42.65.Lm, 42.50.St.
922	This research paper investigates the application of quantum mechanics to Hilbert manifolds and explores the principle of functional relativity. The main objective is to develop a mathematical framework for describing quantum systems on infinite-dimensional manifolds and to demonstrate that the principle of functional relativity holds in this context. Key results include the derivation of a Schr dinger-like equation on a Hilbert manifold and the demonstration that the principle of functional relativity holds for both classical and quantum systems. The paper concludes that the principle of functional relativity is a fundamental property of physical systems and should be considered in the development of future quantum theories.
238	This research paper explores the use of transit timing observations to search for Trojans, a type of small celestial body that share a planet's orbit. The study focuses on transiting extrasolar planets, and the researchers analyze data from the Kepler spacecraft to identify potential Trojan candidates. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of Trojans, as they can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The results indicate several promising candidates for further study, and the authors conclude that transit timing observations offer a valuable tool for detecting Trojans and expanding our understanding of planetary systems.
2488	This research paper explores the fermionic construction of tau functions and their application to random processes. The study focuses on the use of fermionic integrals to construct tau functions, which are solutions to the KP hierarchy of equations. The paper also examines the relationship between tau functions and random matrix theory, showing that the correlation functions of the latter can be expressed in terms of tau functions. The results suggest that fermionic techniques can be a useful tool for understanding the behavior of random processes with applications in various fields such as statistical physics and quantum field theory. Overall, the study highlights the potential of fermionic construction of tau functions in providing insights into the properties of random processes.
3762	This research paper explores the concept of reciprocal symmetry in classical discrete oscillators incorporating half-integral energy levels. The primary focus is on the mathematical analysis of the relationship between reciprocal symmetry and energy levels in these systems. The study finds that the presence of half-integral energy levels leads to the breakdown of reciprocal symmetry, which has important implications for the behavior of these oscillators. The research provides insights into the fundamental principles underlying the behavior of classical discrete oscillators and highlights the importance of considering energy levels in understanding their dynamics.
429	Intelligent Input Methods (IM) are essential for making text entries in many East Asian scripts, but their application to other languages has not been fully explored. This paper discusses how such tools can contribute to the development of computer processing of other oriental languages. We propose a design philosophy that regards IM as a text service platform, and treats the study of IM as a cross disciplinary subject from the perspectives of software engineering, human-computer interaction (HCI), and natural language processing (NLP). We discuss these three perspectives and indicate a number of possible future research directions.
3639	Under the hypotheses of smoothness in the coupling constant, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, the consistent interactions between a single free massless tensor gauge field with the mixed symmetry of a two-column Young diagram of the type (3,1) and one Abelian vector field have been investigated. The computations are done with the help of the deformation theory based on a cohomological approach, in the context of the antifield-BRST formalism. The main result is that there exist nontrivial cross-couplings between these types of fields in five spatiotemporal dimensions, which break the PT invariance and allow for the deformation of the gauge transformations of the vector field, but not of the gauge algebra.
2451	This research paper investigates the propagation of negative- and positive-phase-velocity waves in an isotropic chiral medium that moves at a constant velocity. The study employs the method of moments to derive the dispersion relation of the medium and analyze the effects of chirality and velocity on the waves' propagation. The results show that the medium's chirality affects the waves' frequency and that the waves can propagate in both directions relative to the medium's velocity. The study also reveals that the medium's velocity can significantly impact the waves' propagation and that the waves' phase velocities can exceed the speed of light in certain cases. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of wave propagation in chiral media and may have applications in fields such as telecommunications and material science.
3359	This paper considers the issue of modeling fractional data observed in the interval [0,1), (0,1] or [0,1]. Mixed continuous-discrete distributions are proposed. The beta distribution is used to describe the continuous component of the model since its density can have quite diferent shapes depending on the values of the two parameters that index the distribution. Properties of the proposed distributions are examined. Also, maximum likelihood and method of moments estimation is discussed. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented.
1894	We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find an analytical expression for the Mott insulator(MI)-Superfluid(SF) transition boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex, reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum. Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than one.
2624	This research paper presents a novel approach to the fabrication of analog electronics for serial readout of silicon strip sensors. The proposed method involves the integration of a custom-designed ASIC with the sensor, thereby reducing the number of readout channels required and minimizing power consumption. The fabrication process was optimized to achieve high yield and reliability, and the resulting system was characterized for performance. The key outcomes of this study include the successful integration of the ASIC with the silicon strip sensor, the demonstration of high readout speed and efficiency, and the realization of a compact and low-power system. These findings have significant implications for the development of high-performance sensing and imaging systems in various applications, including particle physics, medical imaging, and industrial inspection.
4028	The research paper investigates the nucleation and growth of multiple metastable phases in a generalized Potts model. The study finds that the competitive nucleation of multiple phases can lead to a violation of the Ostwald rule, which states that the most stable phase is the first to nucleate and grow. Instead, the less stable phase can become dominant due to its faster nucleation rate. The research also shows that the nucleation and growth behavior can be influenced by the system's parameters, such as the size of the critical nucleus. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex nucleation and growth phenomena in materials science and highlights the importance of considering multiple metastable phases in modeling these processes.
1424	"The research paper titled ""Pseudo-localization of singular integrals and noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory"" explores the application of pseudo-localization techniques to singular integrals and noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory. The authors introduce a new type of pseudo-localization operator that allows for the decomposition of singular integrals into a sum of localized operators, which can then be analyzed using noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory. They also establish the boundedness of these localized operators on certain function spaces, providing a powerful tool for the study of singular integrals and related problems. The paper concludes with several applications of these techniques to problems in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Overall, this research provides new insights into the behavior of singular integrals and furthers our understanding of noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory."
2100	Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.
D2-100	It is an approximation useful in chemistry, but not strictly correct. It is not, in general, obeyed by nuclear reactions, or even in one common medical procedure, PET scanning (positron emission tomography). In this procedure, radioactive variants of common drug or body chemicals are injected into a patient under observation. Some of a particular radioactive chemical element or elements are radioactive in a particular way—they are neutron-light. Their nuclear reactions in the body are similar to beta-decay of neutron-heavy elements, except that the “electrons” released are not electrons, but the corresponding anti-matter: positrons. As anti-matter, positrons are quite unwelcome in ordinary matter—the patient—and very quickly encounter electrons, annihilating each electron-positron pair.
1383	One way to understand the nonthermal history of the universe is by establishing the origins of the unresolved and truly diffuse extragalactic gamma rays. Dim blazars and radio/gamma galaxies certainly make an important contribution to the galactic gamma-ray background given the EGRET discoveries, and previous treatments are reviewed and compared with a new analysis. Studies of the gamma-ray intensity from cosmic rays in star-forming galaxies and from structure formation shocks, as well as from dim GRBs, are briefly reviewed. A new hard gamma-ray source class seems required from the predicted aggregate intensity compared with the measured intensity.
2116	Nous montrons comment il est possible d'utiliser l'algorithme d'auto organisation de Kohonen pour traiter des donn\'ees avec valeurs manquantes et estimer ces derni\`eres. Apr\`es un rappel m\'ethodologique, nous illustrons notre propos \`a partir de trois applications \`a des donn\'ees r\'eelles. ----- We show how it is possible to use the Kohonen self-organizing algorithm to deal with data which contain missing values and to estimate them. After a methodological recall, we illustrate our purpose from three real databases applications.
3840	"The research paper titled ""Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets"" discusses the potential for using radio telescopes to detect and characterize exoplanets. The authors propose that radio astrometry could provide valuable information about exoplanets, including their masses and orbits, and could complement existing methods such as radial velocity and transit observations. The paper outlines the technical challenges that must be overcome to make radio astrometry a viable method for exoplanet detection, including the need for precise measurements and the effects of atmospheric and instrumental noise. The authors conclude that radio astrometry has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of exoplanets and should be considered as a valuable tool in exoplanet research."
2772	"The research paper ""The Limits of Special Relativity"" examines the limitations of the theory of special relativity in the context of high-energy physics. The paper discusses the shortcomings of special relativity in explaining phenomena such as the behavior of particles at high energies and the existence of dark matter. The paper proposes that a more comprehensive theory that accounts for these limitations is needed. The findings indicate that while special relativity is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of particles at low energies, it has limitations in the high-energy regime. Therefore, a more comprehensive theory is needed to explain the behavior of particles at all energy levels."
273	This research paper investigates the growth of epitaxial SrRuO3 layers on SrTiO3 substrates under strain, using high-temperature x-ray diffraction. The primary focus is on the mechanism of single-domain growth and the effect of strain on the growth process. The study reveals that strain plays a crucial role in determining the orientation and morphology of the SrRuO3 layers, and that the growth process is highly dependent on the strain state of the substrate. The results provide important insights into the growth of complex oxide thin films and the design of future electronic devices.
2302	We give a brief historical overview of the Tait conjectures, made 120 years ago in the course of his pioneering work in tabulating the simplest knots, and solved a century later using the Jones polynomial. We announce the solution, again based on a substantial study of the Jones polynomial, of one (possibly his last remaining?) problem of Tait, with the construction of amphicheiral knots of almost all odd crossing numbers. An application to the non-triviality problem for the Jones polynomial is also outlined.
973	This research paper explores the use of geometry and topology in the study of relativistic cosmology. The primary theme is to investigate the mathematical structures that underpin the current understanding of the universe and how they relate to observations. The paper reviews the fundamental concepts of general relativity and cosmology, including the Friedmann equations and the cosmic microwave background radiation. It then discusses the role of geometry and topology in interpreting these concepts, with a particular focus on the spatial curvature of the universe and the topology of cosmic structures. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this field and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe.
3283	Further experiments showed the incorrectness of proposed interpretation. We have studied an in-plane resonant photo-response of an integer quantum Hall system in which time-reversal and parity symmetries are broken. The response of initially homogeneous system exhibits a complicate spatial structure sensitive to the system macroscopic sizes. Conceptually, the effect is explained by the large-scale quantum entanglement originated from an indistinguishable particle statistics. The concept is supported by the demonstration of entanglement-related transfer of information in the system interior.
589	This research paper explores the concept of unsatisfaction in colourful neighbourhoods and proposes strategies to minimize it. The study investigates the factors contributing to unsatisfaction, such as noise pollution, lack of green spaces, and inadequate maintenance of public spaces. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and observations, the research identifies the most significant sources of dissatisfaction among residents of colourful neighbourhoods. The paper also suggests practical solutions to address these issues, such as implementing noise reduction measures, increasing access to green spaces, and improving the maintenance of public amenities. The findings of this study have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers seeking to enhance the livability of colourful neighbourhoods and improve the well-being of their residents.
626	Hard processes leading to high transverse momentum hadron production are calculable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for proton-proton collisions. In heavy-ion collisions, such processes occur as well, and due to a separation of scales are calculable on the level of the production of high p_T partons. These subsequently interact with the medium which originates from semi-hard and soft processes in the same collision before they hadronize. The presence of the medium thus modifies the momentum spectrum of outgoing partons and thus hard hadrons. The idea of jet tomography is to study this modification in order to learn about the medium density distribution. While this is a compelling idea, its practical application encounters some difficulties. In this paper, the capability of various observables to provide tomographic information about the medium is discussed and compared.
2026	This research paper deals with the numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy, a measure of the degree of disorder in a system. The paper presents a methodology to estimate critical parameters based on the Bond entropy, which has been shown to be a useful tool for characterizing phase transitions in a variety of physical systems. The authors apply this methodology to a range of systems, including the Ising model, the Potts model, and the XY model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately estimating the critical parameters of these systems. The paper concludes that the Bond entropy is a powerful tool for studying phase transitions and can be used to accurately estimate critical parameters in a variety of physical systems.
1473	The paper investigates the ground-state magneto-optical resonances in cesium vapor confined in an extremely thin cell. The researchers observe a strong dependence of the resonance signals on the cell thickness, which is attributed to the interaction of the vapor with the cell walls. The results also demonstrate the potential for using these resonances for high-precision magnetometry and atomic spectroscopy in a compact and portable device. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the behavior of cesium vapor in thin cells, which could have important implications for future applications in quantum technology.
1231	The full three dimensional dispersion of the pi-bands, Fermi velocities and effective masses are measured with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and compared to first-principles calculations. The band structure by density-functional theory strongly underestimates the slope of the bands and the trigonal warping effect. Including electron-electron calculation on the level of the GW approximation, however, yields remarkable agreement in the vicinity of the Fermi level. This demonstrates the breakdown of the independent electron picture in semi-metallic graphite and points towards a pronounced role of electron correlation for the interpretation of transport experiments and double-resonant Raman scattering for a wide range of carbon based materials.
427	We discuss the extrema of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with different physical properties. We have found necessary and sufficient conditions for realization of the extrema with different properties as the vacuum state of the model. We found explicit equations for extremum energies via parameters of potential if it has explicitly CP conserving form. These equations allow to pick out extremum with lower energy -- vacuum state and to look for change of extrema (phase transitions) with the variation of parameters of potential. Our goal is to find general picture here to apply it for description of early Universe.
2531	We consider a tippe top modeled as an eccentric sphere, spinning on a horizontal table and subject to a sliding friction. Ignoring translational effects, we show that the system is reducible using a Routhian reduction technique. The reduced system is a two dimensional system of second order differential equations, that allows an elegant and compact way to retrieve the classification of tippe tops in six groups as proposed in [1] according to the existence and stability type of the steady states.
2726	A gate is called entangler if it transforms some (pure) product states to entangled states. A universal entangler is a gate which transforms all product states to entangled states. In practice, a universal entangler is a very powerful device for generating entanglements, and thus provides important physical resources for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and quantum information. This Letter demonstrates that a universal entangler always exists except for a degenerated case. Nevertheless, the problem how to find a universal entangler remains open.
D2-82	A PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that allows doctors to observe the metabolic activity of tissues and organs in the body. It involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer (a substance containing a radioactive atom) into the bloodstream. This tracer is typically a form of glucose that is metabolized by cells. The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the tracer, creating detailed images that show how tissues are functioning, rather than just their structure. PET scans are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders (such as Alzheimer’s disease). They are especially useful in identifying abnormal cell activity, which can help detect cancerous tumors.
1909	This research paper explores how von Neumann measurements can help reach the Holevo capacity, which is the maximum amount of classical information that can be transmitted through a quantum channel. The paper provides theoretical analysis and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The findings show that von Neumann measurements can improve the efficiency of quantum communication and increase the amount of information that can be transmitted. This research has important implications for the development of quantum technologies, such as secure communication and quantum computing.
1955	We analyze theoretically adiabatic quantum pumping through a normal conductor that couples the normal regions of two superconductor/normal metal/superconductor Josephson junctions. By using the phases of the superconducting order parameter in the superconducting contacts as pumping parameters, we demonstrate that a non zero pumped charge can flow through the device. The device exploits the evolution of the superconducting phases due to the ac Josephson effect, and can therefore be operated at very high frequency, resulting in a pumped current as large as a few nanoAmperes. The experimental relevance of our calculations is discussed.
D2-63	The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance. Ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of insect-based foods is also crucial. Additionally, developing efficient production and processing methods to scale up insect farming is essential for feasibility.
1394	This research paper presents the results of the analysis of three transits of the exoplanet TrES-2 as part of The Transit Light Curve Project. Observations were conducted using the Kepler Space Telescope and the light curve was analyzed using various techniques to determine the planet's physical characteristics, such as its size, orbital period, and atmospheric composition. The results indicate that TrES-2 is a gas giant planet with a radius of 1.19 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 2.47 days. The planet's atmosphere was found to be largely composed of hydrogen and helium, with a possible presence of water vapor. The findings provide valuable insights into the properties of exoplanets and contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
1633	This research paper explores (2+1)-Einstein spacetimes of finite type, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations in three dimensions. The primary focus is on understanding the geometric and physical properties of these spacetimes, which have important implications for gravitational physics. Through a careful analysis of the mathematical structure of these spacetimes, the paper reveals new insights into the nature of black holes and the behavior of gravitational waves in three-dimensional space. The key discoveries and conclusions of this research have significant implications for our understanding of gravity and the structure of the universe.
1096	This research paper focuses on the conception of a decision-making testing bench (banc d'essais d'ecisionnel) for businesses. The paper outlines the design and development of the bench, including its hardware, software, and testing procedures. The critical outcomes of this research are the identification of important features that should be included in a decision-making testing bench, and the demonstration that the bench is effective in improving decision-making processes within businesses. The paper concludes that the use of such testing benches can improve the accuracy and efficiency of business decision-making, thereby leading to improved business performance.
D2-27	In 1802, Lamarck published Hydrogéologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe. That year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life.
2444	A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm, significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and lower electronic noise.
2415	"The research paper titled ""Universal spectrum for DNA base CG frequency distribution in Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) genome"" explores the frequency distribution of the DNA base CG in the genome of Takifugu rubripes. The study employs a universal scaling analysis to investigate the genomic distribution of CG base pairs. The findings reveal that the CG frequency distribution follows a universal power-law distribution with an exponent of -1.7, which is consistent across different scales and chromosomes. This suggests that there is a fundamental organizational principle underlying the genomic distribution of CG base pairs in Takifugu rubripes. The study's results may have implications for understanding the evolutionary and functional aspects of genome organization in other species."
1043	This research paper presents a symmetric free energy based multi-component lattice Boltzmann method (SFB-MCLBM) for simulating complex fluid systems. The proposed method is capable of handling multiple components and their interactions with different thermodynamic properties. The SFB-MCLBM also preserves the symmetric properties of the free energy to ensure accurate thermodynamic consistency. Our simulation results demonstrate that the SFB-MCLBM method is capable of capturing complex flow behaviors and accurately predicting phase behavior. The proposed method provides a promising approach for simulating complex fluid systems in various engineering and scientific fields.
1022	We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum correlations in the parametric luminescence from semiconductor microcavities in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime. As already demonstrated in recent experiments, a ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the signal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold, accounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and static disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo simulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.
D2-1	The Solar System faces a dramatic future over billions of years. In approximately 5-7 billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury and Venus. Earth may either be consumed or rendered uninhabitable as oceans and atmosphere evaporate. The outer planets will survive but experience significant changes in temperature and orbital dynamics. Eventually, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a white dwarf star. This white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, leaving our former solar neighborhood incredibly dim. Any surviving planets will orbit in perpetual darkness, frozen and lifeless.
2167	This research paper focuses on reciprocal transformations and flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces. The Hurwitz space is a space of branched covers of the Riemann sphere, and reciprocal transformations are a type of transformation that preserves the branch points of these covers. The paper presents a new method for constructing flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces using reciprocal transformations. The authors demonstrate that this method produces flat metrics that are different from previously known metrics on Hurwitz spaces. The paper also provides examples of these new flat metrics and discusses their properties. The essential findings of this research highlight the effectiveness of using reciprocal transformations to construct new flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces, which can lead to further insights into the geometry of these spaces.
99	At the air/water interface, 4,-8-alkyl[1,1,-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (8CB) domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same Langmuir film, as multiple bilayers on a monolayer. The edge dislocation at the domain boundary leads to line tension, which determines the domain shape and dynamics. By observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions, we find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference between the coexisting phases in the film. Comparisons with theoretical treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary locates near the center of the film, which means that the 8CB multilayers are almost symmetric with respect to the air/water interface.
3552	This paper studies the performance of a wireless data network using energy-efficient power control techniques when different multiple access schemes, namely direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB), are considered. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit expressions for the achieved utilities at the Nash equilibrium are derived in terms of the network parameters. A measure of the loss of DS-CDMA with respect to IR-UWB is proposed, which proves substantial equivalence between the two schemes. Simulation results are provided to validate the analysis.
3946	A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.
2978	We review the recently discovered connection between the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of generic cosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last'' hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10). This intriguing connection suggests the existence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or even M-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset space K(E(10)). If true, this gravity/coset correspondence would offer a new view of the (quantum) fate of space (and matter) at cosmological singularities.
2815	The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems. Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and (x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs, K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...
272	Temperature dependent structural phase transitions of SrRuO3 thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) single crystal substrates have been studied using high-resolution x-ray diffraction. In contrast to bulk SrRuO3, coherently strained epitaxial layers do not display cubic symmetry up to ~730 oC and remain tetragonal. Such behavior is believed to be induced by compressive strain between the SrRuO3 layer and SrTiO3 substrate due to lattice mismatch. The tetragonal symmetry during growth explains the single domain growth on miscut SrTiO3 substrates with step edges running along the [100] or [010] direction.
3810	This research paper focuses on the theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities. The main objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physical phenomenon of Raman scattering in microcavities, where the interaction between photons and excitons leads to the formation of polaritons. The paper highlights the crucial role of microcavities in enhancing the Raman scattering process and enabling the observation of new phenomena, such as polariton-mediated Raman scattering. The research findings suggest that polariton-mediated Raman scattering can be utilized for sensitive and selective sensing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential future research directions in this field.
2392	We calculate the very high energy (sub-GeV to TeV) inverse Compton emission of GRB afterglows. We argue that this emission provides a powerful test of the currently accepted afterglow model. We focus on two processes: synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission within the afterglow blast wave, and external inverse Compton (EIC) emission which occurs when flare photons (produced by an internal process) pass through the blast wave. We show that if our current interpretations of the Swift XRT data are correct, there should be a canonical high energy afterglow emission light curve. Our predictions can be tested with high energy observatories such as GLAST, Whipple, H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. Under favorable conditions we expect afterglow detections in all these detectors.
632	We determine from Polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity. Their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Moreover we study the inverse decay length of the correlation between the real parts and between the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compare the results with expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.
2724	An infinite family of ND spaces endowed with sl(2)-coalgebra symmetry is introduced. For all these spaces the geodesic flow is superintegrable, and the explicit form of their common set of integrals is obtained from the underlying sl(2)-coalgebra structure. In particular, ND spherically symmetric spaces with Euclidean signature are shown to be sl(2)-coalgebra spaces. As a byproduct of this construction we present ND generalizations of the classical Darboux surfaces, thus obtaining remarkable superintegrable ND spaces with non-constant curvature.
2600	This research paper investigates the obscured quasar population using optical, mid-infrared, and X-ray surveys. The primary theme of the study is to understand the nature of these quasars and their properties. The findings suggest that the obscured quasars have a significant contribution to the total quasar population and that they have a higher dust content than unobscured quasars. The study also highlights the importance of multi-wavelength surveys in identifying and characterizing these elusive objects. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the obscured quasar population and their role in the evolution of galaxies.
3608	In this talk I have raised the question of how the future discovery of leptonic CP violation can be made robust even at accepting the rather large current experimental uncertainties in our knowledges of neutrino propagation in matter. To make progress toward answering the difficult question, I listed ways to proceed: (1) Obtain tighter constraints on the MSW theory by testing it by various neutrino experiments. (2) Measure the matter effect in situ, namely within the experiment for discovering CP violation itself. (3) Uncover leptonic CP violation in a matter effect free environment. I also reported a step made toward the above point (2) by taking neutrino factory as a concrete setting; An accurate in situ measurement of the matter effect looks promising.
1227	We conducted extensive numerical experiments of equal mass three-body systems until they became disrupted. The system lifetimes, as a bound triple, and the Lyapunov times show a correlation similarto what has been earlier obtained for small bodies in the Solar System. Numerical integrations of several sets of differently randomised initial conditions produced the same relationship of the instability time and Lyapunov time. Marginal probability densities of the various times in the three-body experiments are also discussed. Our high accuracy numerical method for three-body orbit computations and Lyapunov time determinations is concisely described.
1063	The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321. This class contains the freely-braided permutations and the fully-commutative permutations. In this work, we show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative pattern classes can be transformed to give generating functions for the corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes. Moreover, this transformation of generating functions is rational. As a result, we obtain enumerative formulas for the pattern classes mentioned above as well as the corresponding hexagon-avoiding pattern classes where the hexagon-avoiding permutations are characterized by avoiding 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, and 56781234.
1354	"The research paper titled ""Interactions and star formation activity in Wolf-Rayet galaxies"" explores the relationship between interactions of galaxies and the star formation activity in Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies. The study uses multi-wavelength observations of 54 WR galaxies to analyze their star formation and interaction history. The results indicate that WR galaxies with higher interaction strength have higher star formation rates and more compact star-forming regions. Additionally, the study finds that WR galaxies with multiple nuclei and tidal tails exhibit more vigorous star formation activity. The findings suggest that interactions play a significant role in triggering star formation in WR galaxies, and the presence of multiple nuclei and tidal tails can enhance this process. Overall, the study highlights the importance of galaxy interactions in shaping the star formation activity in WR galaxies."
3209	We report an angular resolved photoemission study of Na0.73CoO2 where it is found that the renormalization of the quasiparticle (QP) dispersion changes dramatically upon a rotation from GM to GK. The comparison of the experimental data to the calculated band structure reveals that the QP-renormalization is most pronounced along the GK-direction, while it is significantly weaker along the GM-direction. We discuss the observed anisotropy in terms of multiorbital effects and point out the relevance of magnetic correlations for the band structure of Na0.73CoO2.
3101	This research paper presents the first experimental observation of a topological phase for spin-orbit transformations on a laser beam. The authors demonstrate that the circular polarization of a laser beam passing through a specially designed birefringent plate can be used to induce a topological phase shift, resulting in a spin-dependent splitting of the beam. The observed effect is found to be robust against imperfections in the experimental setup, and could have significant implications for the development of novel photonic devices and quantum information processing.
1034	We consider a model for periodic patterns of charges constrained over a cylindrical surface. In particular we focus on patterns of chiral helices, achiral rings or vertical lamellae, with the constraint of global electroneutrality. We study the dependence of the patterns' size and pitch angle on the radius of the cylinder and salt concentration. We obtain a phase diagram by using numerical and analytic techniques. For pure Coulomb interactions, we find a ring phase for small radii and a chiral helical phase for large radii. At a critical salt concentration, the characteristic domain size diverges, resulting in macroscopic phase segregation of the components and restoring chiral symmetry. We discuss possible consequences and generalizations of our model.
395	"The research paper titled ""Rough Sets Computations to Impute Missing Data"" explores the use of rough set theory to impute missing data in datasets. The paper presents an imputation algorithm based on rough set theory that can handle both categorical and continuous data. The method was tested on several datasets and compared with other imputation methods, showing promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The paper concludes that the proposed method is a viable option for imputing missing data in real-world datasets."
1550	We observe several interesting phenomena in a technicolor-like model of electroweak symmetry breaking based on the D4-D8-D8bar system of Sakai and Sugimoto. The benefit of holographic models based on D-brane configurations is that both sides of the holographic duality are well understood. We find that the lightest technicolor resonances contribute negatively to the Peskin-Takeuchi S-parameter, but heavy resonances do not decouple and lead generically to large, positive values of S, consistent with standard estimates in QCD-like theories. We study how the S parameter and the masses and decay constants of the vector and axial-vector techni-resonances vary over a one-parameter family of D8-brane configurations. We discuss possibilities for the consistent truncation of the theory to the first few resonances and suggest some generic predictions of stringy holographic technicolor models.

The paper provides a detailed analysis of the algebraic structure and its applications, highlighting the advantages and limitations of this approach compared to existing methods. The results of this study have important implications for the development of new techniques for quantum computation and information processing.
1944	Starting with an adjoint pair of operators, under suitable abstract versions of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl M-function of extensions of the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions and we establish results on the relationship between the M-function as an analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We also give an example where the M-function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to elliptic PDEs where the M-function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.
D2-26	The global increase in demand for meat and the limited land area available prompt the search for alternative protein sources. Also the sustainability of meat production has been questioned. Edible insects as an alternative protein source for human food and animal feed are interesting in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions, high feed conversion efficiency, low land use, and their ability to transform low value organic side streams into high value protein products. More than 2000 insect species are eaten mainly in tropical regions. The role of edible insects in the livelihoods and nutrition of people in tropical countries is discussed, but this food source is threatened
2511	This research paper presents a simulation of four-body interaction in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processor. The study aims to investigate the feasibility of using NMR for quantum information processing with four-body interactions. The simulation considered the effects of the J-coupling interaction, dipolar interaction, and chemical shift anisotropy on the system. The results showed that four-body interactions can be achieved through careful manipulation of the system parameters, such as the pulse sequence and the strength of the magnetic field. The study also highlights the importance of minimizing decoherence effects and optimizing the control parameters for successful implementation of four-body interactions. Overall, the research suggests that NMR is a promising platform for implementing four-body interactions in quantum information processing and provides insights for future experimental studies in this area.

Key findings include the identification of unique features in the light curves and the potential for future discoveries in this field.
97	We report an experimental realization of one-way quantum computing on a two-photon four-qubit cluster state. This is accomplished by developing a two-photon cluster state source entangled both in polarization and spatial modes. With this special source, we implemented a highly efficient Grover's search algorithm and high-fidelity two qubits quantum gates. Our experiment demonstrates that such cluster states could serve as an ideal source and a building block for rapid and precise optical quantum computation.
3210	This research paper investigates the anisotropic quasiparticle renormalization in Na0.73CoO2 and the role of inter-orbital interactions and magnetic correlations in this process. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observe significant renormalization in the electronic structure of Na0.73CoO2. Our results demonstrate that inter-orbital interactions play a crucial role in the renormalization process, leading to anisotropic renormalization of the quasiparticle bands. We also find evidence for the presence of magnetic correlations, which further enhance the renormalization effect. Our findings provide new insights into the electronic properties of Na0.73CoO2 and have implications for the understanding of other correlated electron systems.

The approach is based on the use of matrix exponential functions to approximate the evolution of SGS tensors in order to predict their behavior in turbulent flows. The proposed method is tested using numerical simulations of turbulent flows, and the results show that the matrix exponential-based closures provide accurate predictions of the SGS stress tensor. Additionally, the approach is shown to be computationally efficient and can be easily implemented in existing turbulence models. This research contributes to the development of improved turbulence models for a wide range of applications, including engineering and environmental fluid dynamics.
690	This research paper presents a thorough characterisation of a three-dimensional Brownian motor in optical lattices. The Brownian motor is a microscopic system that converts thermal fluctuations into directed motion, making it a promising candidate for nanoscale engineering and transportation applications. The optical lattices provide a periodic potential landscape that serves as a trap for the Brownian motor, allowing it to move in a controlled manner. The characterisation of the Brownian motor is performed using a combination of theoretical modelling and experimental measurements, including the evaluation of the motor's efficiency and the analysis of its dynamics. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of Brownian motors in complex environments, which can be used to improve their design and optimise their performance for various applications.
3942	Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out
D2-40	An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways.
2366	The application of Superheated Droplet Detectors (SDDs) to dark matter searches has so far been confined to the light nuclei refrigerants C2ClF5 and C4F10 (SIMPLE and PICASSO, respectively), with a principle sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions. Given the competitive results of these devices, as a result of their intrinsic insensitivity to backgrounds, we have developed a prototype trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I)-loaded SDD with increased sensitivity to spin-independent interactions as well. A low (0.102 kgd) exposure test operation of two high concentration, 1 liter devices is described, and the results compared with leading experiments in both spin-dependent and -independent sectors. Although competitive in both sectors when the difference in exposures is accounted for, a problem with fracturing of the detector gel must be addressed before significantly larger exposures can be envisioned.
68	This research paper compares the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for signal analysis. The study analyzes the performance of both transforms in terms of time and frequency resolution, computational complexity, and noise robustness. The results show that CWT provides better time-frequency resolution compared to DWT, but at a higher computational cost. However, DWT is found to be more robust to noise. The study concludes that the choice of transform depends on the specific application and the trade-off between resolution and computational cost.
2130	This research paper presents the results of optical spectroscopy conducted on a sample of Extreme High Energy Peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The primary theme of the study was to investigate the nature and properties of these rare and powerful sources of gamma-ray radiation, which are believed to be associated with supermassive black holes. The study found that EHBLs exhibit a range of spectral features and properties, suggesting that they may be driven by different physical processes. The authors conclude that further observational and theoretical studies are needed to fully understand the nature of these enigmatic objects.
460	This research paper investigates the Wigner functions, coherent states, one-dimensional marginal probabilities, and uncertainty structures of Landau levels. Using the Wigner formalism, we derive the Wigner functions for the coherent states of the Landau Hamiltonian, and subsequently obtain the corresponding one-dimensional marginal probabilities. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional marginal probabilities are dependent on the magnetic field strength, and exhibit oscillatory behavior. We also analyze the uncertainty structures of these states, and show that they obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Our results shed light on the quantum behavior of charged particles in a magnetic field, and provide a deeper understanding of Landau levels.
1348	This research paper investigates the connection between the clump lifetimes and the initial mass function (IMF) of young stellar populations. The study employs numerical simulations of gas clouds collapsing and forming stars to demonstrate that clump lifetimes are directly related to the slope of the IMF. The results indicate that a steeper IMF leads to shorter clump lifetimes, which in turn affect the star formation rate and subsequent evolution of the stellar population. The findings suggest that the IMF plays a crucial role in determining the properties and evolution of young star clusters.
2849	The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding, is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme, achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer considerable improvements over these existing results.
490	The research paper presents a model of late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) that simulates memory maintenance. The model focuses on the role of protein synthesis in the maintenance of L-LTP and how it can be disrupted by inhibitors. The simulation results suggest that protein synthesis is a critical factor in memory maintenance. The study also highlights the importance of L-LTP in the formation of long-term memory and provides insight into potential therapeutic targets for memory disorders. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of memory and the potential for developing effective treatments for memory-related disorders.
2066	This research paper investigates the collective excitations of hard-core bosons at half filling on square and triangular lattices. Using numerical simulations, the paper shows that as the strength of the interactions between the bosons is increased, a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum develops. The paper also finds that this roton minimum collapses at a critical interaction strength, leading to a breakdown of the superfluid state. Additionally, the paper compares the behavior of the bosons on square and triangular lattices, finding that the triangular lattice has a larger roton gap and a stronger tendency towards superfluidity. The results of this study have implications for understanding the behavior of strongly interacting bosons in condensed matter systems.
918	This research paper investigates the behavior of solitary and shock waves in discrete double power-law materials. The study focuses on the propagation of these waves in a one-dimensional lattice, where the material properties are described by a double power-law potential. The analysis is carried out using numerical simulations and analytical calculations. The results show that the material's nonlinearity and anisotropy significantly affect the characteristics of the waves, such as their amplitude, speed, and shape. Moreover, it is found that the presence of the double power-law potential leads to the formation of new types of waves, such as asymmetric solitary waves and oscillatory shock waves. These findings have implications for the design and control of materials with tailored mechanical properties, such as high-energy absorbing structures and impact-resistant materials.
1587	The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes suggested in [1], and modified later in [2], is tested by computing the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is particularized for two important families of spacetimes, conformal to the previous ones: (standard) static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach essentially reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for multiple classical spacetimes: Reissner-Nordstrom (including Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.
803	Events with observed D* and/or muons in the final state were used to indicate the presence of beauty quark production and to study the correlations between the particles coming from the same or different B-hadrons. The Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) theoretical predictions for such processes were often available only at parton level. A method to calculate visible level cross sections at NLO, based on an interface of the FMNR program to PYTHIA 6.2, is applied. It uses the NLO description at b-quark level provided by FMNR applying a statistical reduction procedure (REDSTAT) that allows the link to PYTHIA, from where the description of the B-hadron decay chain is obtained. Comparisons of the data and NLO cross sections at visible and b-quark level were found to be consistent and equivalent.
394	Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex. This paper explores an imputation technique based on rough set computations. In this paper, characteristic relations are introduced to describe incompletely specified decision tables.It is shown that the basic rough set idea of lower and upper approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99%.
2650	An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.
569	This research paper investigates the curious case of NGC6908, a peculiar galaxy located in the southern skies. Through the analysis of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic data, we explore the physical properties and evolutionary history of this galaxy, including its morphology, kinematics, and chemical composition. We find that NGC6908 exhibits a complex structure with multiple components, including a central bar, a nuclear ring, and a surrounding disk. Furthermore, we discover evidence of recent star formation activity and gas inflows, suggesting ongoing dynamical processes. Ultimately, our findings shed light on the intricate nature of galaxy evolution and provide new insights into the formation and evolution of peculiar galaxies.
1575	This research paper explores the potential of using permutation codes as a basis for constructing space-time codes. By leveraging the properties of permutation codes, we propose a novel construction method for space-time codes that offers improved performance and reduced complexity compared to traditional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and show that our proposed space-time codes outperform existing codes in terms of bit error rate and outage probability. Our findings suggest that permutation codes can serve as a promising foundation for the development of space-time codes and pave the way for further research in this area.
588	Colouring sparse graphs under various restrictions is a theoretical problem of significant practical relevance. Here we consider the problem of maximizing the number of different colours available at the nodes and their neighbourhoods, given a predetermined number of colours. In the analytical framework of a tree approximation, carried out at both zero and finite temperatures, solutions obtained by population dynamics give rise to estimates of the threshold connectivity for the incomplete to complete transition, which are consistent with those of existing algorithms. The nature of the transition as well as the validity of the tree approximation are investigated.

The results obtained from the experiment provide valuable insights into how aerosols scatter light in the atmosphere and can be used to improve atmospheric models. The study concludes that the FASER instrument is a reliable and effective tool for measuring the aerosol phase function at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
2344	This research paper examines the manifestations of skeletal structures of a filamentary matter found on the Sun. The study provides observations and analysis of these skeletal structures, including their formation, evolution, and disappearance. Our observations suggest that these filamentary structures are essential components of the complex magnetic field structures on the Sun, and their presence and behavior have significant implications for the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. The study utilizes high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic measurements to provide detailed insights into the physical properties of the filamentary matter. Our findings provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the formation and evolution of these structures and the impact of their behavior on the overall dynamics of the Sun's atmosphere.
450	This research paper investigates the dynamics of nuclear spin polarization in quantum dots controlled by a single electron. The study demonstrates that the nuclear spin polarization can be significantly enhanced by controlling the electron spin. It also shows that the direction of the enhanced polarization can be controlled by manipulating the electron spin, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. Overall, the study highlights the potential for controlling nuclear spin polarization in quantum dots and provides insights into the dynamics of this process.
161	We consider a possible interpretation of the new charm-strange meson Ds0*(2317) as a hadronic molecule - a bound state of D and K mesons. Using an effective Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong Ds0* to Ds pi0 and radiative Ds0* to Ds* gamma decays. A new impact related to the DK molecular structure of the Ds0*(2317) meson is that the presence of u(d) quarks in the D and K mesons gives rise to a direct strong isospin-violating transition Ds0* to Ds pi0 in addition to the decay mechanism induced by eta-pi0 mixing considered previously. We show that the direct transition dominates over the eta-pi0 mixing transition in the Ds0* to Ds pi0 decay. Our results for the partial decay widths are consistent with previous calculations.
3865	This research paper explores the correlation between supernova polarization and the Type IIn classification. Using data from multiple telescopes and observations, we analyze the polarization properties of a sample of Type IIn supernovae. Our findings suggest that polarization can be a valuable tool in distinguishing between Type IIn and other types of supernovae. Additionally, we discuss the implications of this research for understanding the physical mechanisms behind supernova explosions. Overall, our study highlights the importance of polarization measurements in supernova classification and sheds light on the complex nature of these stellar events.
1431	Accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be less luminous in X-rays than non-accretors, an effect that has been detected in various star forming regions. To explain this we have combined, for the first time, a radiative transfer code with an accretion model that considers magnetic fields extrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface, with extended field lines interacting with the disc. We study the propagation of coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they are strongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns. The reduction in the observed X-ray emission depends on the field geometry, which may explain why accreting T Tauri stars show a larger scatter in their observed X-ray luminosity compared to non-accreting stars.
499	"The research paper titled ""The square gradient model in a two-phase mixture I. Equilibrium properties"" explores the square gradient model and its application in predicting equilibrium properties of two-phase mixtures. The primary focus of the paper is to investigate how the square gradient model can be used to accurately predict the coexistence curve, interfacial tension, and density profiles of two-phase mixtures. The study found that the square gradient model was successful in predicting these equilibrium properties and was able to provide insights into the behavior of two-phase mixtures. The paper concludes that the square gradient model is a valuable tool for predicting the properties of two-phase mixtures and can be applied to a wide range of systems."
3118	"The research paper ""Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks"" focuses on the algebraic structure of Gaussian Bayesian networks and their relation to algebraic geometry. The primary focus is on the underlying algebraic varieties and their properties. The paper presents a novel approach to studying Gaussian Bayesian networks using tools from algebraic geometry. The remarkable finding is that the geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks is intimately related to the geometry of their underlying algebraic varieties. The conclusion is that this approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing Gaussian Bayesian networks and can lead to new insights and applications in various fields, including machine learning and statistics."
2354	We investigate possible mass shift and width broadening of J/psi in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rule. Input values of gluon condensates at finite temperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and pressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~ 1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results in change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the phenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach maximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.
3473	This research paper aims to resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the refractive index for a nonmagnetic two-component medium. The study investigates the theoretical and experimental aspects of the refractive index and proposes a new methodology for its calculation. The results of the research show that the refractive index for a nonmagnetic two-component medium can be accurately determined using the proposed methodology. The findings of this study have significant implications for various fields, including optics, materials science, and engineering.
2591	The research paper investigates the isospin diffusion process in a thermal AdS/CFT system with flavor. Isospin diffusion is the process of the transfer of isospin (charge) between particles as a result of their interactions. The study uses a holographic approach to investigate the isospin diffusion process in a strongly interacting system of quarks and gluons. The results show that the inclusion of flavor degrees of freedom can significantly affect the isospin diffusion process. The researchers conclude that their findings provide insights into the properties of quark-gluon plasma, which is a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang and is believed to be recreated in high-energy particle collisions.
370	We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M 2-9 and may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.
2552	Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta. However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.
2955	This research paper presents the AKARI detection of B0104-72.3, an infrared-bright supernova remnant located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using data from the AKARI telescope, we constructed a spectral energy distribution of the remnant and found it to be consistent with a thermal emission model. We also estimated the physical parameters of the remnant, such as its temperature and mass, and compared them to other supernova remnants in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our results suggest that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged remnant with a relatively high temperature and mass, indicating a powerful explosion. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the study of supernova remnants and the evolution of massive stars.
567	"The research paper titled ""Single NanoParticle Photothermal Tracking (SNaPT) of 5 nm gold beads in live cells"" presents a novel technique for tracking the movement of individual nanoparticles in live cells. The technique, called SNaPT, uses photothermal imaging to detect the heat generated by a gold nanoparticle as it moves through the cell. The researchers applied SNaPT to track 5 nm gold beads in live HeLa cells and observed the beads moving in a random, Brownian-like motion. The study demonstrates the potential of SNaPT for studying the dynamics of nanoparticles in live cells and provides insights into the behavior of nanoparticles in biological systems. The paper highlights the importance of developing new techniques for tracking nanoparticles in living systems, which will be critical for advancing the field of nanomedicine."
3448	This research paper examines the lattice dynamics of a Heisenberg chain coupled to finite frequency bond phonons. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, the authors investigate the effects of the coupling on the phonon spectrum and the spin dynamics of the Heisenberg chain. They find that the coupling leads to the emergence of a new type of phonon mode, which is strongly coupled to the spin chain and can affect its magnetic properties. The authors also observe interesting phenomena such as the suppression of the spin stiffness and the emergence of a spin-Peierls transition. Overall, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and magnetic correlations in low-dimensional quantum systems.
1457	This research paper investigates the globally stable quasistatic evolution in plasticity with softening. The study focuses on the mathematical analysis of the plasticity model, which includes a softening term. The findings show that the quasistatic evolution of the model is globally stable, even in the presence of softening. This result is significant because it provides a better understanding of the behavior of materials undergoing plastic deformation and can inform the design of more resilient structures. The study also offers insights into the mathematical analysis of plasticity models and their evolution.
3218	This paper explores the intersection of geometry, quantum mechanics, and neuroscience to investigate the phenomenon known as the quantum Zeno effect. Specifically, we examine the role of the axiom of choice in the geometry of time and its implications for the neuro-biological basis of the quantum Zeno effect. Using mathematical models and empirical evidence from neuroscientific studies, we argue that the quantum Zeno effect is intimately tied to the structure of time and the way in which the brain processes information. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of the geometry of time and the quantum Zeno effect could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of more powerful quantum computing technologies.
473	"In order to obtain more comprehensive information about an celestial object, the radio image must be identified with the optical one. Many years the identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria, which leads to abundant misidentifications and ""empty field"" in optics for the radio sources. For this reason significant part of radio sources do not have identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of radio sources if compared with the optical one. By taking into account the radio refraction, the major number of the radio sources can be successfully identified with the optical objects."
3034	This research paper investigates the performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in multihop networks with opportunistic relay selection. The primary focus is to analyze the impact of various parameters, such as number of relays, channel conditions, and power allocations, on the throughput and delay of the HARQ scheme. The paper also proposes a novel relay selection algorithm that improves the system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of throughput and delay, and the optimal number of relays and power allocation can vary depending on the channel conditions. The study concludes that HARQ with opportunistic relay selection is a promising solution for improving the performance of multihop networks.
D2-77	The possibility of extraterrestrial life is rooted in the abundance of potentially habitable environments and the presence of basic components necessary for life. In our solar system, planets like Mars and moons such as Europa and Enceladus show promise due to evidence of water, a key ingredient for life. Beyond our solar system, exoplanets in habitable zones, identified through missions like Kepler, suggest countless opportunities for life. However, while conditions may be favorable, the origin of life remains elusive, requiring the right environment, building blocks, and catalytic events. Detection of life relies heavily on advanced telescopes and space probes, with confirmation posing significant challenges. Regardless of current limitations, the search for extraterrestrial life continues.
1958	In this research paper, we present a groupoid approach to noncommutative T-duality, a fundamental concept in string theory. By introducing a new notion of groupoid action, we provide a unified framework that encompasses various noncommutative geometries. Our approach leads to a novel understanding of noncommutative T-duality and sheds light on its relation to the geometry of the target space. We also establish a concrete correspondence between certain noncommutative T-dual pairs. Our results suggest that groupoids provide a powerful tool for studying noncommutative geometry and its applications in theoretical physics.
2928	This research paper focuses on the connection between proto-neutron star winds, magnetar birth, and gamma-ray bursts. The study aims to explore the physical mechanisms that drive magnetar formation and the resulting gamma-ray bursts. The research utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of proto-neutron stars and their subsequent winds. The analysis reveals that the magnetar formation and the resulting gamma-ray bursts are a consequence of the proto-neutron star winds. The findings suggest that the proto-neutron star winds are crucial in the formation of magnetars and the generation of gamma-ray bursts. The results of this study provide critical insights into the physical processes that govern the formation of magnetars and the associated gamma-ray bursts.
1571	This research paper investigates the local impurity effects in superconducting graphene. Specifically, we explore how the presence of impurities in the graphene lattice influences the superconducting properties of the material. Our findings suggest that the local impurity effects can significantly affect the superconducting behavior of graphene, altering its critical temperature and coherence length. Furthermore, we observe that the nature and location of the impurities play a crucial role in determining the extent of their impact on superconductivity. Our study adds to the growing body of research on the behavior of superconducting graphene and provides insights into the design and development of graphene-based superconductors.
419	We review Maxwell's multipole vectors, and elucidate some of their mathematical properties, with emphasis on the application of this tool to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, for a completely random function on the sphere (corresponding to the statistically isotropic Gaussian model of the CMB), we derive the full probability density function of the multipole vectors. This function is used to analyze the internal configurations of the third-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe quadrupole and octopole, and we show the observations are consistent with the Gaussian prediction. A particular aspect is the planarity of the octopole, which we find not to be anomalous.
D2-5	There were observations of spectral lines. That means there are distinct levels where electrons stay. Classical mechanics does not allow such distinctive levels for electrons to stay. For this new approach is needed. In classical mechanics, energy remains constant. This must be building block. It is my interpretation. Then. he thought that the electrons obey some function distribution which give distinctive levels. This is possible for sin and cos functions. So the electrons should obey sin and cos functions and also obey total energy conservation i.e to start with kinetic energy + potential energy = constant. Potential energy and sin function is not problem, because we know pendulum oscillations. How to modify kinetic energy to give sine function.
498	In order to describe a nonuniform equilibrium mixture with an interface between two coexisting phases it is necessary to consider contributions to the Helmholtz energy which depend on the gradients of for instance the density. Van der Waals \cite{vdW/sg, vdW/translation} was the first to introduce such a term, which is very important in the interfacial region for a one-component system. Cahn & Hilliard \cite{cahnhilliard/fens/I} extended this analysis to a binary mixture by introducing gradient terms of the mol fraction. We give an systematic extension of the gradient theory to three-dimensional multi-component systems.
3665	The research paper discusses the concept of quantum group of isometries in both classical and noncommutative geometry. The authors explore the relationship between these two fields and present a new approach to studying quantum groups of isometries using noncommutative geometry. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the structure of quantum groups in various geometries and provides key results that enable further exploration of this concept. The authors conclude that a deeper understanding of the quantum group of isometries can lead to new insights in areas such as mathematical physics, differential geometry, and topology.
670	This research paper presents the results of an experiment conducted at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to study the production of cascade hypernuclei. The central focus of the study is to understand the properties of these exotic nuclei, which contain strange quarks. The paper reports the observation of a new hypernuclear state in the production spectra and provides insight into the production mechanism of cascade hypernuclei. The key findings suggest that the production of cascade hypernuclei is sensitive to the incident energy and the target nucleus. These results have important implications for our understanding of nuclear physics and the properties of the strong force.
3940	The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.
1835	We experimentally study the fluid flow induced by a broad, penetrable barrier moving through an elongated dilute gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate. The barrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the resulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. We examine both cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: At slow speeds of the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the condensate. At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which the condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton formation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the condensate is seen again.
1064	This research paper presents a new algorithm for enumerating maximally clustered permutations, which are permutations that have the maximum number of monotone subsequences. The algorithm is based on a recursive decomposition of permutations into simpler structures, and it has a time complexity of O(n^4) and a space complexity of O(n^3). The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm and its properties, including a proof that it generates all maximally clustered permutations. The algorithm is implemented in a computer program, and experiments show that it is efficient and scalable for large values of n. The paper concludes by discussing some applications of maximally clustered permutations in various fields of mathematics and computer science.
D2-57	"In modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.  The experiment poses the question, ""when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?"" (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox."
2555	The research paper examines the two-way coupling of FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow. The study aims to understand the interaction between the polymer molecules and turbulent fluid flow and how they affect each other. The researchers utilized numerical simulations and found that the presence of FENE dumbbells led to a reduction in the turbulent kinetic energy, which in turn decreased the turbulent intensity. They also observed that the elastic forces exerted by the FENE dumbbells on the fluid had a significant impact on the turbulence structure. The study concludes that the two-way coupling between FENE dumbbells and a turbulent shear flow has a significant impact on the fluid dynamics and can be used to control turbulence in practical applications.
788	This paper examines the efficiency gains that can be achieved in generalized method of moments (GMM) models when auxiliary data is available. We consider a semiparametric approach that allows for nonparametric estimation of the moment functions, and we show that incorporating auxiliary data in the estimation procedure can lead to substantial efficiency improvements. We develop a semiparametric efficiency bound that characterizes the best possible efficiency that can be achieved with the available information, and we propose a computationally efficient estimator that asymptotically achieves this bound. We illustrate our approach through a simulation study and an empirical application to the estimation of a production function using data from the U.S. manufacturing sector. Our results suggest that incorporating auxiliary data can lead to significant efficiency gains, particularly when the sample size is small or the instrument set is weak.
1277	This research paper examines the structure of two-generator subalgebras of Lie algebras. The authors investigate the properties of such subalgebras, including their structure and possible representations. They focus on two particular classes of Lie algebras: the Heisenberg Lie algebra and the Witt algebra. The authors prove that every two-generator subalgebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra is either solvable or nilpotent, while every two-generator subalgebra of the Witt algebra is either solvable or has a non-abelian free Lie subalgebra. These results have implications for the classification and study of Lie algebras, and provide a foundation for further research in the field.
3339	The possibility that around some astrophysical objects there are non-static magnetic fields of enormous intensity suggests that in these situations real particles may be produced. The slowness of the variation is compensated by the huge intensity. The main issue is the production of e+,e- pairs annihilating into photons and the direct production of photons, as one of the concurrent process in the GRB (gamma ray bursts). Then some simple effects due to the presence of the intense gravity are studied and finally a look is given to the production of other kinds of particles.
1668	This research paper explores the relationship between Whitehead's Trilogy and the curvature of spacetime. The paper argues that Whitehead's philosophical framework provides a useful lens through which to understand the nature of spacetime, particularly in relation to the curvature of space caused by the presence of mass and energy. Drawing on Whitehead's concepts of actual entities, prehensions, and concrescence, the paper develops a new model for understanding the curvature of spacetime that is grounded in a relational ontology. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this new model for our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and the implications for future research in physics and philosophy.
1031	The paper presents a Bayesian approach to rough set theory, which involves using prior knowledge to make more accurate decisions about the classification of data. The authors propose a new Bayesian rough set model and demonstrate its effectiveness in several real-world applications. The approach is shown to be particularly useful when dealing with incomplete or uncertain data, and the results suggest that it can outperform traditional rough set models in certain scenarios. Overall, the study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating Bayesian methods into rough set analysis.
2147	The Lifshitz-type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the van der Waals interaction between an atom (molecule) and a single-wall carbon nanotube are obtained. The single-wall nanotube is considered as a cylindrical sheet carrying a two-dimensional free electron gas with appropriate boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field. The obtained formulas are used to calculate the van der Waals free energy and force between a hydrogen atom (molecule) and single-wall carbon nanotubes of different radia. Comparison studies of the van der Waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom-nanotube separation distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls.
2705	This research paper focuses on the large-scale structures in the universe and the origin of galaxies. The paper presents a comprehensive study of the various structures in the universe, including clusters, superclusters, filaments, and voids. The paper also discusses the current theories and models that explain the formation and evolution of galaxies within these structures. The outcomes of the study suggest that the distribution of galaxies and other cosmic structures is strongly influenced by dark matter and dark energy. The paper concludes that further research and observations are necessary to fully understand the complex processes that shape the structure of the universe.
2445	This research paper reports on the observation of an anti-correlation between scintillation and ionization for MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon. The study involved measurements of the energy deposition and scintillation light production in liquid xenon using a gamma-ray source. The results showed that the scintillation light yield decreased as the ionization yield increased, indicating an anti-correlation between the two. The authors suggest that this anti-correlation may be due to the recombination of electrons and ions in the liquid xenon. These findings have important implications for the development of liquid xenon-based detectors for dark matter searches and other applications.
3406	We investigate the phases of the ionic Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). At half-filling, when the interaction strength or the staggered potential dominate we find Mott and band insulators, respectively. When these two energies are of the same order we find a metallic region. Charge and magnetic structure factors demonstrate the presence of antiferromagnetism only in the Mott region, although the externally imposed density modulation is present everywhere in the phase diagram. Away from half-filling, other insulating phases are found. Kinetic energy correlations do not give clear signals for the existence of a bond-ordered phase.
3837	We describe preliminary results of a global model of the radiatively-driven photoionized wind and accretion flow of the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1. The full model combines FLASH hydrodynamic calculations, XSTAR photoionization calculations, HULLAC atomic data, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. We present maps of the density, temperature, velocity, and ionization parameter from a FLASH two-dimensional time-dependent simulation of Vela X-1, as well as maps of the emissivity distributions of the X-ray emission lines.
993	The study investigates quantized spin excitations in a ferromagnetic microstrip through microwave photovoltage measurements. The authors present experimental evidence of the existence of spin waves in the microstrip, which are quantized and exhibit discrete frequencies. They also demonstrate that the spin waves can be excited and controlled through microwave radiation. The findings suggest the potential use of spin waves as a means of information processing and transmission in future spintronic devices. Overall, the study offers new insights into the behavior of spin waves in ferromagnetic microstrips and their potential for spintronic applications.
2241	This research paper presents an achievable rate region for interference channels with conferencing, which is a communication network where multiple transmitters and receivers exchange information over a shared channel. The primary theme of this paper is to investigate how conferencing can improve the communication performance in interference channels. The paper proposes a new coding scheme that enables the transmitters to exchange messages through a common message-passing protocol, which results in an achievable rate region that outperforms the existing schemes. The essential finding of this research is that conferencing can significantly enhance the capacity of interference channels, and the proposed coding scheme achieves this improvement. The paper concludes that conferencing can be a useful technique in designing efficient communication systems for interference channels.
2719	This research paper investigates the performance of sparse estimators and their ability to achieve the oracle property, a desirable property in statistical estimation that ensures optimal performance. Specifically, we focus on the return of Hodges' estimator and compare its performance to other commonly used sparse estimators. Through theoretical analysis and simulation studies, we find that Hodges' estimator outperforms other sparse estimators in terms of achieving the oracle property, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our results suggest that Hodges' estimator should be considered as a viable option for sparse estimation problems.
2588	The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference, allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.
3133	"We discuss the possibility of GLAST detecting gamma-rays from the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic halo. We have used ""Via Lactea"", currently the highest resolution simulation of Galactic cold dark matter substructure, to quantify the contribution of subhalos to the annihilation signal. We present a simulated allsky map of the expected gamma-ray counts from dark matter annihilation, assuming standard values of particle mass and cross section. In this case GLAST should be able to detect the Galactic center and several individual subhalos."
3512	In many real-world oscillator systems, the phase response curves are highly heterogeneous. However, dynamics of heterogeneous oscillator networks has not been seriously addressed. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze such a system by dealing explicitly with the heterogeneous phase response curves. We develop a novel method to solve the self-consistent equations for order parameters by using formal complex-valued phase variables, and apply our theory to networks of in vitro cortical neurons. We find a novel state transition that is not observed in previous oscillator network models.
1685	The paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of a particle system with degenerate rates, which is a common model for many physical and biological processes. The authors derive the hydrodynamic limit of the system, which describes the behavior of the macroscopic variables such as density and velocity in the limit of large number of particles. They show that the hydrodynamic equations can be obtained as a limit of the particle system and prove the convergence of the solutions. Moreover, they establish the uniqueness of the hydrodynamic limit and characterize the stability of the system. These results have significant implications in the study of various phenomena such as traffic flow, crowd dynamics, and chemical reactions.
2465	This research paper explores the relationship between inflation, bifurcations of nonlinear curvature Lagrangians, and dark energy. The study uses mathematical models to investigate how these factors impact the evolution of the universe. The research findings suggest that inflation and dark energy are intertwined, and that bifurcations in Lagrangians can lead to the emergence of dark energy. The paper concludes that these insights can inform future research on the evolution of the universe and the role of dark energy in its expansion.
2876	The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well with a diluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation with an in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positively charged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fast oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing times up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole g factor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of hole localization at cryogenic temperatures.
2189	The research paper discusses the determination of the equation of state for atomic systems beyond s-wave using the lowest order constrained variational method. The study focuses on the large scattering length limit, where the system exhibits universal behavior. The researchers develop an improved method for calculating the equation of state, which allows them to accurately predict the properties of the system in this regime. The results show that the equation of state is highly sensitive to the details of the interaction potential, with different potentials leading to different results. The study provides important insights into the behavior of atomic systems beyond s-wave and highlights the need for accurate interaction potentials in determining their properties.
2562	We have discovered a long radio trail at 843 MHz which is apparently associated with middle age pulsar PSR J1509-5850. The radio trail has a length of ~7 arcmin. In X-rays, Chandra observations of PSR J1509-5850 reveal an associated X-ray trail which extends in the same orientation as the radio trail. Moreover, two clumpy structures are observed along the radio trail. The larger one is proposed to be the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate MSC 319.9-0.7. Faint X-ray enhancement at the position of the SNR candidate is found in the Chandra data.
2652	We consider the influence of the inclusion of interatomic interactions on the delta-kicked accelerator model. Our analysis concerns in particular quantum accelerator modes, namely quantum ballistic transport near quantal resonances. The atomic interaction is modelled by a Gross-Pitaevskii cubic nonlinearity, and we address both attractive (focusing) and repulsive (defocusing) cases. The most remarkable effect is enhancement or damping of the accelerator modes, depending on the sign of the nonlinear parameter. We provide arguments showing that the effect persists beyond mean-field description, and lies within the experimentally accessible parameter range.
3192	Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.
756	This research paper investigates the role of entanglement, fidelity and topological entropy in a quantum phase transition to topological order. Through the use of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these measures can effectively capture the transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase. Our results indicate that the topological entropy is a robust measure that is able to detect the transition, while the fidelity enables us to pinpoint the critical point of the transition. Additionally, we show that the entanglement entropy can be used to characterize the different phases. These findings provide insights into the nature of quantum phase transitions and the role of entanglement in topological order.
1921	This research paper explores the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and its impact on the scaling relations in galaxy clusters. The paper reviews previous studies and models, examining the various observational biases that affect SZ profiles and scaling relations. The authors present new simulations that take into account these effects and demonstrate how they can significantly impact the analysis of SZ data. The findings suggest that careful consideration of these observational biases is critical to accurately interpreting SZ profiles and scaling relations in galaxy clusters. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research to improve the accuracy of SZ data analysis.
1837	We present imaging data and photometry for the COSMOS survey in 15 photometric bands between 0.3um and 2.4um. These include data taken on the Subaru 8.3m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes, and the CFHT 3.6m telescope. Special techniques are used to ensure that the relative photometric calibration is better than 1% across the field of view. The absolute photometric accuracy from standard star measurements is found to be 6%. The absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors accurate to 2% or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with the expected values. Finally, as the first step in the scientific analysis of these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving.
3846	It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
146	The research paper discusses the coordination of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders. The study proposes a decentralized approach that enables agents to coordinate their movements without relying on a central control system. The approach uses a combination of local communication and decision-making algorithms to achieve coordination. The paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving coordination and maintaining the formation of the group of agents. The findings indicate that the decentralized approach can efficiently coordinate a group of autonomous agents with multiple leaders, even when the environment is dynamic and uncertain. The study concludes that the proposed approach is a promising solution for coordination problems in multi-agent systems.
3545	This research paper explores the use of Bragg interactions for the manipulation of Bose-Einstein condensates. The study demonstrates how precise control over the position and velocity of the condensate can be achieved through the use of Bragg pulses. Furthermore, the paper presents evidence that the technique can be used to create complex interference patterns and potentially useful in quantum information processing. The findings suggest that Bragg interactions provide a powerful tool for the manipulation of ultra-cold atomic systems.
3297	"In a rigorous construction of the path integral for supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a Riemann manifold, based on B\""ar and Pf\""affle's use of piecewise geodesic paths, the kernel of the time evolution operator is the heat kernel for the Laplacian on forms. The path integral is approximated by the integral of a form on the space of piecewise geodesic paths which is the pullback by a natural section of Mathai and Quillen's Thom form of a bundle over this space. In the case of closed paths, the bundle is the tangent space to the space of geodesic paths, and the integral of this form passes in the limit to the supertrace of the heat kernel."
1621	The research paper presents a study of the radio lobes of Pictor A using X-ray spatially resolved analysis. The lobes were found to have a complex structure, with different regions exhibiting distinct spectral properties. The X-ray emission was found to be dominated by synchrotron radiation, with evidence of inverse Compton scattering in some regions. The study provides insights into the physical processes responsible for the formation and evolution of radio lobes. The findings have implications for understanding the role of active galactic nuclei in the evolution of galaxies.
1322	The paper explores the coevolution of quantum wave functions and the Friedmann universe, using numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of a scalar field in a cosmological setting. The results show that the evolution of the wave function is strongly influenced by the expansion of the universe, leading to the suppression of high-frequency modes and the emergence of classical behavior. This phenomenon is found to be related to the growth of the scale factor and the onset of inflation. The study suggests that the interplay between quantum mechanics and cosmology may have important implications for our understanding of the early universe and the nature of physical reality. Overall, the research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop a consistent and comprehensive theory of quantum gravity.
2803	We propose a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes.
3087	The stochastic action principle (SAP) and maximum entropy (ME) are fundamental concepts in statistical physics that provide a unified framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems. This research paper explores the relationship between SAP and ME, and highlights their applications in various fields including thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and information theory. We demonstrate that the SAP and ME principles can be used to derive important results such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Jarzynski equality, and the H-theorem. We also discuss the limitations and challenges in applying these principles to real-world systems, and suggest future directions for research in this area. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of SAP and ME in understanding the behavior of complex systems and provides a foundation for further investigation in this field.
315	We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the radiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large anomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an extra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be generated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the conformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs mass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with the Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as the Z boson decay width.
3961	The paper presents a new and exact boundary condition to solve the Schrodinger equation of many-electron systems. The boundary condition involves the use of an auxiliary potential function that accurately describes the behavior of the wave function near the boundary of the system. The authors demonstrate that this new boundary condition significantly improves the accuracy of the solutions obtained, particularly for systems with strong correlations between electrons. The results obtained using the new boundary condition are compared with those obtained using other commonly used boundary conditions, and it is shown that the new approach outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. The authors conclude that the new boundary condition provides a promising approach to accurately solve the Schrodinger equation of many-electron systems and has the potential to be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical systems.
2425	This research paper explores the role of vacuum energy and renormalization in quantum field theory on the edge. The central focus is to understand how these concepts can be applied to investigate the properties of the edge modes in topological phases of matter. Through mathematical calculations and simulations, the study reveals that the edge modes are affected by the vacuum energy and require renormalization to accurately describe their behavior. The significant outcomes of this research provide new insights into the understanding of quantum field theories on the edge and their potential applications in future technologies.
2157	This research paper aims to understand the magnetoreceptor mechanism in birds. The primary focus is to investigate the role of cryptochrome, a photoreceptor protein, in the detection and processing of magnetic information. Through a review of existing literature and experimental data, the study concludes that cryptochrome plays a crucial role in the magnetoreception process, potentially acting as a magnetoreceptor itself or as a co-factor in the process. The findings provide valuable insights into the complex mechanism behind birds' ability to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field.
2696	We investigate the physical property of the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.
2142	This research paper investigates the existence and properties of surface gap solitons at the interface between two media with different nonlinearities. The study uses numerical simulations and shows that these solitons can exist at certain parameter regimes, even when standard gap solitons are not possible. The paper also provides insights into the relationship between the soliton's properties and the nonlinearity interface's characteristics. The results suggest potential applications in nonlinear optics and photonics for controlling light propagation at interfaces.
1922	Masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, which are ground states of light or/and heavy quarks and antiquarks, have been calculated in the framework of an extended model of quasi-independent quarks with absolute uncertainties about 30 MeV. It is shown that the assumption on equidistant discrete levels for a mean field energy does not contradict to existing data and permits to reduce a number of model parameters. It is obtained, that a difference between neighbouring mean field energy levels is flavour independent. Values of spin-spin interaction between quarks and antiquarks with different flavours in pseudoscalar and vector mesons are presented.
948	This research paper explores the characteristics and behavior of Blazhko RR Lyrae stars using observations from the 24-inch telescope at the Konkoly Observatory. The study reveals that these stars exhibit cyclic variations in their brightness and pulsation periods, and the amplitudes of the variations may change over time. The findings suggest that the Blazhko effect may be caused by non-radial pulsations or magnetic fields in the stars. Overall, this research provides insight into the complex nature of RR Lyrae stars and their potential use as standard candles in cosmological distance measurements.
1357	We derive coupled-cluster equations for three-body Hamiltonians. The equations for the one- and two-body cluster amplitudes are presented in a factorized form that leads to an efficient numerical implementation. We employ low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions and calculate the binding energy of He-4. The results show that the main contribution of the three-nucleon interaction stems from its density-dependent zero-, one-, and two-body terms that result from the normal ordering of the Hamiltonian in coupled-cluster theory. The residual three-body terms that remain after normal ordering can be neglected.
1441	This research paper explores the origin of the soft excess observed in Seyfert 1 AGN. Through detailed spectral analysis and modeling, we find evidence supporting an absorption origin for the soft excess, specifically due to ionized gas located along the line of sight to the central engine. We also investigate the potential implications of this finding for our understanding of the structure and physics of AGN. Overall, our study highlights the importance of detailed spectral analysis in uncovering the complex physical processes at work in these fascinating cosmic objects.

The main objective of this study is to understand the physics behind the generation and behavior of radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The study investigates the effect of various parameters such as gas pressure, frequency, and power on the discharge characteristics. The results of the study highlight the importance of the plasma sheath in determining the discharge characteristics and the need for accurate modeling of the sheath region. The study also shows that the discharge characteristics are strongly dependent on the frequency and power of the applied voltage. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the generation and behavior of radio-frequency discharges in oxygen and can be used to optimize the performance of plasma-based applications such as surface treatment, etching, and deposition.
2706	The dynamics of quasicrystals is characterized by the existence of phason excitations in addition to the usual phonon modes. In order to investigate their interplay on an elementary level we resort to various one-dimensional model systems. The main observables are the static, the incoherent, and the coherent structure factor, which are extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic periodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic and anharmonic interaction potentials. In the dynamic Fibonacci chain neighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips. The difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic Fibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width. If a bias is introduced in the well depth, dispersionless optic phonon bands split off.
1796	This research paper investigates the mixing-demixing transition and collapse of a vortex state in a quasi-two-dimensional boson-fermion mixture. By utilizing numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the addition of fermions to the mixture can significantly impact the vortex dynamics and lead to a collapse of the vortex state. More specifically, we find that the collapse occurs due to the reduction of the effective bosonic interactions caused by the presence of fermions. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between bosonic and fermionic components in such mixtures and provide insight into the behavior of vortex states in these systems.
2987	"The research paper titled ""Diatomic Molecule as a Quantum Entanglement Switch"" explores the potential of a diatomic molecule to act as a switch for quantum entanglement. The study uses computer simulations and mathematical models to demonstrate how the molecule can be used to control the entanglement of two quantum systems. The researchers found that the molecule can be used to selectively entangle and disentangle quantum states, making it a promising tool for quantum information processing.

3981	"The research paper titled ""Finite Drude weight for 1D low temperature conductors"" explores the concept of Drude weight in one-dimensional (1D) conductors at low temperatures. The Drude weight is a measure of the electrical conductivity of a material, and in this study, the researchers focus on how it behaves in 1D conductors with low temperatures. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Drude weight and its finite values in 1D conductors, which is in contrast to the infinite value in higher dimensions. The paper concludes that the Drude weight in 1D conductors is not only finite but can also be tuned by changing the temperature and the strength of the interactions between the electrons. This study provides insights into the behavior of 1D conductors at low temperatures and could have implications for the design of future electronic devices."
1361	We report on the realization of a multi-orbital system with ultracold atoms in the excited bands of a 3D optical lattice by selectively controlling the band population along a given lattice direction. The lifetime of the atoms in the excited band is found to be considerably longer (10-100 times) than the characteristic time scale for inter-site tunneling, thus opening the path for orbital selective many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Upon exciting the atoms from an initial lowest band Mott insulating state to higher lying bands, we observe the dynamical emergence of coherence in 1D (and 2D), compatible with Bose-Einstein condensation to a non-zero momentum state.
D1-30	The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains uncertain, with two main theories under discussion. The dominant hypothesis suggests a natural origin through zoonotic spillover, where the virus jumped from bats, its likely reservoir, to humans, possibly via an intermediate species such as pangolins. This theory links the early outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live wild animals were sold. Another theory suggests an accidental leak from a laboratory, like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat coronaviruses, though no direct evidence supports this claim. While most scientists favor the natural origin hypothesis, limited data and restricted early access make the exact source of the virus difficult to confirm.
2586	This research paper focuses on the development of realizable Hamiltonians for universal adiabatic quantum computers. The authors explore various techniques for constructing these Hamiltonians and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of computational performance.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the future of quantum computing and the potential for practical applications in fields such as cryptography and optimization.
1368	This research paper explores the mixed hyperbolic-second order parabolic formulations of general relativity. The paper investigates the mathematical properties of these formulations and their potential applications in the study of gravitational waves. Through numerical simulations, the paper demonstrates that mixed formulations provide a more efficient and accurate approach to solving the Einstein field equations. Additionally, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of these formulations and highlights their potential for future research in the field of general relativity and gravitational wave physics. Overall, this research contributes to the development of computational tools for investigating the properties of gravitational waves and the behavior of spacetime in the presence of massive objects.
953	This paper deals with sensors which compute and report linguistic assessments of their values.Such sensors, called symbolic sensors are a natural extension of smart ones when working with control systems which use artificial intelligence based technics. After having recalled the smart sensor concepts, this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones. Links between the physical world and the symbolic one are described. It is then shown how Zadeh's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors. Finally, since the symbolic sensor is a general component, a functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed.
784	This research paper investigates the exact Floquet states of a driven condensate and their stabilities. The driven condensate is modeled using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Floquet theory is used to obtain the time-periodic solutions of the equation. The exact Floquet states are obtained by solving the time-independent Schr dinger equation and the stability of these states is analyzed using linear stability analysis. The results show that the stability of the exact Floquet states depends on the driving frequency and the amplitude of the driving potential. In particular, the stability of the states is enhanced when the driving frequency is close to the natural frequency of the condensate. The findings of this study provide insights into the dynamics of driven condensates and could have potential applications in the design of quantum devices based on condensates.
3502	The Dirac theory in the Euclidean Taub-NUT space gives rise to a large collection of conserved operators associated to genuine or hidden symmetries. They are involved in interesting algebraic structures as dynamical algebras or even infinite-dimensional algebras or superalgebras. One presents here the infinite-dimensional superalgebra specific to the Dirac theory in manifolds carrying the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole. It is shown that there exists an infinite-dimensional superalgebra that can be seen as a twisted loop superalgebra.
1195	The research paper investigates the phenomenon of peak effect in polydisperse particle systems, which refers to the peak in the critical current density as a function of magnetic field. The authors study the disordering transitions that occur in such systems, which can lead to the formation of vortices and affect the peak effect. Using simulations and experiments, the authors explore the effects of particle size distribution, interparticle interactions, and other factors on the disordering transitions and peak effect. They find that the peak effect is determined by a delicate balance between disordering and ordering effects, and that polydispersity can enhance or suppress the peak effect depending on the specific system. The results of the study have implications for the design and optimization of superconducting materials and other particle systems with disordering transitions.
89	A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes, emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes, and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial differential equations.
58	"The research paper titled ""Symmetry Relations for Trajectories of a Brownian Motor"" explores the properties of a Brownian motor, which is a device that can convert thermal energy into mechanical work. The authors investigate the symmetry properties of the motor's trajectory using mathematical models and simulations. The main finding of the study is that the motor's trajectory exhibits a remarkable symmetry, which is related to the underlying symmetries of the motor's structure. The authors also show that this symmetry can be broken by external perturbations, which can lead to changes in the motor's efficiency. Overall, the study provides new insights into the fundamental properties of Brownian motors and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics."
2583	We consider a problem of nuclear waste contamination. It takes into account the thermal effects. The temperature and the contaminant's concentration fulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure in the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both concentration and temperature. The equations are nonlinear and strongly coupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we introduce a scheme adapted to this problem. We prove the stability and convergence of this scheme and give some error estimates.
D2-25	"Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, both essential to our understanding of strong nuclear forces, yet they differ in several key ways. Fundamental Nature Quarks are elementary fermions that serve as the building blocks of hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other composite particles). Six ""flavors"" exist: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. In contrast, gluons are gauge bosons that mediate the strong force between quarks, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. Properties Quarks possess fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3), mass, spin-1/2, and color charge. Gluons are massless, have spin-1, carry no electric charge, but uniquely possess both color and anticolor charges."
D2-32	Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives over the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, 'green' means to fuel our cars and targeted therapies for attacking 'superbugs' and diseases, such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical applications. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago.
1742	As an alternative to commonly used electrical methods, we have investigated the optical pumping of charged exciton complexes addressing impurity related transitions with photons of the appropriate energy. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that the pumping fidelity can be very high while still maintaining a switching behavior between the different excitonic species. This mechanism has been investigated for single quantum dots of different size present in the same sample and compared with the direct injection of spectator electrons from nearby donors.
3254	An integrable self-adjoint 7-point scheme on the triangular lattice and an integrable self-adjoint scheme on the honeycomb lattice are studied using the sublattice approach. The star-triangle relation between these systems is introduced, and the Darboux transformations for both linear problems from the Moutard transformation of the B-(Moutard) quadrilateral lattice are obtained. A geometric interpretation of the Laplace transformations of the self-adjoint 7-point scheme is given and the corresponding novel integrable discrete 3D system is constructed.
218	This is an incomplete survey of some non-Abelian discrete symmetries which have been used recently in attempts to understand the flavor structure of leptons and quarks. To support such symmetries, new scalar particles are required. In some models, they are very massive, in which case there may not be much of a trace of their existence at the TeV scale. In other models, they are themselves at the TeV scale, in which case there is a reasonable chance for them to be revealed at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.
3472	The refractive index of a dielectric medium comprising both passive and inverted components in its permittivity was determined using two methods: (i) in the time domain, a finite-difference algorithm to compute the frequency-domain reflectance from reflection data for a pulsed plane wave that is normally incident on a dielectric half-space, and (ii) in the frequency domain, the deflection of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam on transmission through a dielectric slab. The dielectric medium was found to be an active medium with a negative real part for its refractive index. Thereby, a recent controversy in the scientific literature was resolved.
750	"The research paper titled ""Checking Equivalence of Quantum Circuits and States"" focuses on the problem of checking whether two given quantum circuits or states are equivalent. The authors propose a novel method called the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which can efficiently approximate any quantum circuit or state using a finite set of elementary gates. The algorithm is then used to check the equivalence of two circuits or states by comparing their approximations. The authors also provide a proof of the algorithm's correctness and analyze its time complexity. The main conclusion of the paper is that the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is an effective tool for checking the equivalence of quantum circuits and states, and can be used in a variety of applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing."
3493	This research paper presents an environment-dependent charge potential (EDCP) model for water that considers the influence of the surrounding environment on the charge distribution of water molecules. The EDCP model is based on a polarizable force field and takes into account the electrostatic polarization and dispersion interactions between water molecules and their surroundings. The EDCP model was found to accurately predict the properties of water in different environments, such as bulk water, ice, and water near a charged surface. The results suggest that the EDCP model can provide a more accurate description of water behavior in various environments and could potentially lead to the development of more efficient computational models for studying complex systems involving water.
1804	This research paper explores the relationship between two measures of complexity in formal language theory: bounded pushdown dimension (BPD) and Lempel-Ziv information density (LZID). BPD is a measure of the amount of memory required to recognize a language, while LZID measures the amount of compression that can be achieved for a given language. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that BPD and LZID are highly correlated for a range of languages, suggesting that they capture similar aspects of language complexity. Moreover, we show that these measures can be used to distinguish between different classes of languages and to predict the performance of various parsing algorithms. Our findings have important implications for the design and optimization of natural language processing systems.
2060	This research paper explores the concept of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, focusing on the role of scalar gravitons in this phenomenon. The study is based on a theoretical model that proposes the existence of a scalar field that contributes to the acceleration of the Universe's expansion. The paper presents a detailed analysis of this model, including the derivation of equations and their solutions. The findings indicate that the scalar graviton field can indeed account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and the paper concludes that this model provides a promising avenue for further research in this area.
3104	"We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complex analytic spaces. Our method is based on Poletsky theory of discs, Rosay Theorem on holomorphic discs and our recent joint-work with Pflug on cross theorems in dimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and a generalization of Siciak's relative extremal function. Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations to global extensions"". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classical method of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type."
3253	Longitudinal studies could be complicated by left-censored repeated measures. For example, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, there is a detection limit of the assay used to quantify the plasma viral load. Simple imputation of the limit of the detection or of half of this limit for left-censored measures biases estimations and their standard errors. In this paper, we review two likelihood-based methods proposed to handle left-censoring of the outcome in linear mixed model. We show how to fit these models using SAS Proc NLMIXED and we compare this tool with other programs. Indications and limitations of the programs are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown.
29	I propose a scheme for reconstructing the weak value of an observable without the need for weak measurements. The post-selection in weak measurements is replaced by an initial projector measurement. The observable can be measured using any form of interaction, including projective measurements. The reconstruction is effected by measuring the change in the expectation value of the observable due to the projector measurement. The weak value may take nonclassical values if the projector measurement disturbs the expectation value of the observable.
541	We sketch the derivation of a Newtonian gravity-like force emerging from a direct-action variant of classical electromagnetism. The binding energy is a consequence of maximal phase correlation of the sources mediated by approximately monochromatic direct-action fields. The resulting force then has the character of a strong version of the van der Waals force, whose superior strength can be attributed to relatively coherent primary fields (compared with the totally incoherent effects of the ZPF). The model also predicts the existence of a background having some of the character of dark energy.
3838	This research paper focuses on hydrodynamic and spectral simulations of High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) winds. The study utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the properties of the wind from HMXBs, specifically examining the effect of the binary system's parameters on the wind's dynamics. The results demonstrate that the wind's properties are strongly correlated with the binary system's parameters and that the wind's behavior is significantly affected by the presence of the companion star. These findings highlight the importance of considering binary system parameters when studying HMXB wind properties. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into HMXB wind dynamics, contributing to a better understanding of the properties of these complex systems.
435	For every rational homology 3-sphere with 2-torsion only we construct a unified invariant (which takes values in a certain cyclotomic completion of a polynomial ring), such that the evaluation of this invariant at any odd root of unity provides the SO(3) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant at this root and at any even root of unity the SU(2) quantum invariant. Moreover, this unified invariant splits into a sum of the refined unified invariants dominating spin and cohomological refinements of quantum SU(2) invariants. New results on the Ohtsuki series and the integrality of quantum invariants are the main applications of our construction.
1864	This research paper focuses on the interaction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) blastwaves with wind-shaped circumburst media. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the effects of the medium's density and velocity on the evolution of the blastwaves. The results show that the shape and dynamics of the blastwave are highly dependent on the properties of the medium. The study also suggests that certain observed features of GRBs can be explained by the interaction with wind-shaped media. Overall, this research provides insights into the physical mechanisms behind GRBs and their surrounding environments.
2767	The recursion relations of hierarchical models are studied and contrasted with functional renormalisation group equations in corresponding approximations. The formalisms are compared quantitatively for the Ising universality class, where the spectrum of universal eigenvalues at criticality is studied. A significant correlation amongst scaling exponents is pointed out and analysed in view of an underlying optimisation. Functional flows are provided which match with high accuracy all known scaling exponents from Dyson's hierarchical model for discrete block-spin transformations. Implications of the results are discussed.
1975	This research paper presents experimental studies on vacancy-induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2. The primary focus is on the effect of oxygen vacancies on the magnetic properties of TiO2. The study reveals that oxygen vacancies induce ferromagnetism in TiO2, and the magnetic properties depend on the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The study also highlights the importance of defect engineering for tailoring the magnetic properties of materials. The findings have significant implications for the development of spintronic devices based on TiO2.
8	The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks, here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.
625	This research paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to energy-efficient modulation in CDMA networks with delay constraints. The paper aims to find a modulation scheme that can maximize energy efficiency while satisfying the delay requirements of the network. The proposed approach uses a non-cooperative game model to capture the interactions between the users in the network. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining delay constraints. The study concludes that the game-theoretic approach can be a useful tool for designing energy-efficient modulation schemes in CDMA networks.
1828	We introduce a convenient parametrization of dark energy models that is general enough to include several modified gravity models and generalized forms of dark energy. In particular we take into account the linear perturbation growth factor, the anisotropic stress and the modified Poisson equation. We discuss the sensitivity of large scale weak lensing surveys like the proposed DUNE satellite to these parameters. We find that a large-scale weak-lensing tomographic survey is able to easily distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from LCDM and to determine the perturbation growth index to an absolute error of 0.02-0.03.
1208	Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory comprising a collection of BF models and a set of three-form gauge fields are constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based on specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of smooth, local, PT invariant, Lorentz covariant, and Poincare invariant interactions, supplemented with the requirement on the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that the deformation procedure modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations as well as the accompanying algebra.
283	This research paper presents a planar spin-transfer device with a dynamic polarizer that can control the spin polarization of the injected current. The primary focus is to improve the efficiency of spin-transfer torque-induced magnetization switching in magnetic tunnel junctions. The device was fabricated using advanced lithography techniques, and its performance was evaluated using electrical and magnetic measurements. The noteworthy findings include a significant reduction in the required switching current density and an enhancement of the spin-torque efficiency. The conclusions highlight the potential of dynamic polarizers in improving the performance of spintronic devices.
2727	The search for a universal entangler has been a topic of great interest in the field of quantum computing. In this research paper, we explore the existence of a universal entangler that can be used to generate highly entangled states efficiently. Through a thorough analysis of various entangling operations, we demonstrate the existence of a specific entangler that can be used to generate entangled states with high fidelity. Furthermore, we provide a proof of the universality of this entangler, showing that it can be used to generate any entangled state with arbitrary precision. Our findings have significant implications for the development of quantum computing technologies, as the ability to efficiently generate highly entangled states is critical for many quantum algorithms.
2388	A combination of the memory function formalism and time-dependent density-functional theory is applied to transport in dilute magnetic semiconductors. The approach considers spin and charge disorder and electron-electron interaction on an equal footing. Within the weak disorder limit and using a simple parabolic approximation for the valence band we show that Coulomb and exchange scattering contributions to the resistivity in GaMnAs are of the same order of magnitude. The positional correlations of defects result in a significant increase of Coulomb scattering, while the suppression of localized spin fluctuations in the ferromagnetic phase contributes substantially to the experimentally observed drop of resistivity below T_c. A proper treatment of dynamical screening and collective excitations is essential for an accurate description of infrared absorption.
1126	This research paper investigates the impact of Mn doping on the magnetic properties of ZnO at room temperature. Through a combination of experimental techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic measurements, we demonstrate that the introduction of Mn into ZnO leads to a significant enhancement in the magnetic moment. Our findings suggest that Mn-doped ZnO has potential as a magnetic material for use in a range of applications, including spintronics and magnetic storage devices. These results provide insight into the fundamental properties of Mn-doped ZnO and highlight the potential for further research in this area.
3766	This research paper explores alternative approaches to understanding the equilibrium properties of hard-sphere liquids. The main objective is to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of different methods for calculating the thermodynamic properties of these liquids, including the radial distribution function, pressure, and compressibility. Using computer simulations and analytical techniques, we compare the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics simulations, and integral equation theories. Our findings reveal that while each method has its advantages and limitations, integral equation theories provide the most accurate and efficient approach for calculating the thermodynamic properties of hard-sphere liquids over a wide range of densities and temperatures. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of processes involving hard-sphere liquids, such as colloidal suspensions and nanoparticle dispersions.
925	"The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on the concept of ""sensory substitution"" or ""perceptual supplementation"", we are developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults."
1976	We demonstrate that the strong anomalies in the high frequency LO-phonon spectrum in cuprate superconductors can in principle be explained by the enhanced electronic polarizability associated with the self-organized one dimensionality of metallic stripes. Contrary to the current interpretation in terms of transversal stripe fluctuations, the anomaly should occur at momenta parallel to the stripes. The doping dependence of the anomaly is naturally explained, and we predict that the phonon line-width and the spread of the anomaly in the transverse momentum decrease with increasing temperature while high resolution measurements should reveal a characteristic substructure to the anomaly.
129	"It is shown that the the interference of above-threshold electron de Broglie waves, generated by an intense laser pulse at a metal surface yields attosecond electron pulses. This inerference is an analogon of the superposition of high harmonics generated from rare gas atoms, resulting in trains of attosecond light pulses.Owing to the inherent kinematic dispersion, the propagation of attosecond de Broglie waves in vacuum is very different from that of attosecond light pulses, which propagate without changing shape. Above the metal surface there are ""collaps bands"" and ""revival layers"" of the electron current even at macroscopic distances. In the range of parameters considered, the maximum value of the current densities of such ultrashort electron pulses has been estimated to be of order of couple of tenths of milliamps per square centimeters."
2530	This research paper investigates the spin-polarized transport properties of weakly coupled double quantum dots in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Using a numerical simulation approach, the authors examine the effects of magnetic fields and spin polarization on the transport characteristics of the system. They find that spin-polarized transport can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field and bias voltage, and that the spin polarization can be enhanced by increasing the coupling between the quantum dots. The authors conclude that these findings could have important implications for the development of spintronic devices, which rely on the manipulation of electron spin for information storage and processing.
4048	This research paper investigates the vortex dynamics in superconductors with a fractal cluster structure at the initial stage of resistive transition. The primary theme is to understand the influence of the fractal dimension of the cluster structure on the vortex dynamics. The study finds that the fractal dimension affects the vortex motion and the critical current density of the superconductor at the initial stage of resistive transition. The results suggest that the fractal dimension can be used as a control parameter to optimize the properties of superconductors for various applications.
3793	We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in first-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomistic simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals.
65	This research paper presents a mid-infrared laser light nulling experiment using single-mode conductive waveguides. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of nulling laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths using waveguides.

3393	This research paper explores the ontology of temperature in nonequilibrium systems. The main objective is to investigate how temperature can be defined and understood in systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. The paper examines the role of statistical mechanics in defining temperature and discusses how this approach can be extended to nonequilibrium systems. The results show that temperature in nonequilibrium systems is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to a single measure. Instead, temperature must be understood in the context of the system's dynamics, with different measures of temperature depending on the specific properties of the system under consideration. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of nonequilibrium systems and for the broader understanding of temperature in physics.
1907	The research paper explores the behavior of cosmological singularities in spatially-homogeneous models with a cosmological constant.

The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the conditions that lead to isotropic singularities in these models and investigates the effect of a cosmological constant on the singularity behavior. The crucial results of the study suggest that the presence of a cosmological constant can delay or prevent the onset of isotropic singularities, leading to a more stable and predictable universe. The paper concludes that further research is needed to fully understand the role of the cosmological constant in the behavior of cosmological singularities.
509	It had been proposed that overstretching double stranded DNA from the 5-5 ends will produce a new fiber form of dsDNA that is narrower than the S form that has been suggested to result when the dsDNA is overstretched from the 3-3 ends. We present the first comparison of the structures that result when dsDNA is overstretched from the 5-5, 3-3, and 3-5 ends and show that the stability of the overstretched form depends on the ends to which the force is applied. The stability also depends strongly on the ionic environment as well as the presence of reagents that bind to ssDNA.

1291	We report a detailed spectroscopic study of the pressure induced neutral-ionic phase transition (NIT) of the mixed-stack charge-transfer (CT) crystal tetrathiafulvalene-chloranil (TTF-CA). We show that the pressure induced phase transition is still first-order and involves the presence of an intermediate disordered phase, defined by the coexistence of two species of different ionicity. Further application of pressure gradually converts this phase into an homogeneous ferroelectric phase with a single ionicity. In addition, we detect strong pretransitional phenomena which anticipate the intermediate phase and are indicative of a precursor dynamic regime dominated by fluctuations.
203	We study resonances of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics. We use the calculus of variations to determine the additive forcing function that induces the largest response, that is, the greatest deviation from the unperturbed dynamics. We include the additional constraint that only select degrees of freedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of problems in which not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly. Furthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples.

Overall, this work provides new insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.
1510	Successful predictions are among the most compelling validations of any model. Extracting falsifiable predictions from nonlinear multiparameter models is complicated by the fact that such models are commonly sloppy, possessing sensitivities to different parameter combinations that range over many decades. Here we discuss how sloppiness affects the sorts of data that best constrain model predictions, makes linear uncertainty approximations dangerous, and introduces computational difficulties in Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis. We also present a useful test problem and suggest refinements to the standards by which models are communicated.

3058	A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.

They provide an introduction to the basic concepts in modern (probabilistic) coding theory, highlighting connections with statistical mechanics. We also stress common concepts with other disciplines dealing with similar problems that can be generically referred to as `large graphical models'. While most of the lectures are devoted to the classical channel coding problem over simple memoryless channels, we present a discussion of more complex channel models. We conclude with an overview of the main open challenges in the field.
1276	J. G. Thompson showed that a finite group G is solvable if and only if every two -generated subgroup is solvable. Recently, Grunevald, Kunyavskii, Nikolova, and Plotkin have shown that the analogue holds for finite-dimensional Lie algebras over infinite fields of characteristic greater than 5. It is a natural question to ask to what extent the two-generated subalgebras determine the structure of the algebra. It is to this question that this paper is addressed. Here, we consider the classes of strongly-solvable and of supersolvable Lie algebras, and the property of triangulability.
181	Security of the three-party quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes based on entanglement and a collective eavesdropping check is analyzed in the case of considerable quantum channel losses. An opaque attack scheme is presented for the dishonest agent to eavesdrop the message obtained by the other agent freely, which reveals that these QSS schemes are insecure for transmission efficiencies lower than 50%, especially when they are used to share an unknown quantum state. Finally, we present a general way to improve the security of QSS schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state.
2506	We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the observational result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.
1143	This research paper investigates the impact of cosmic-ray events on the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) background.

The study uses Monte Carlo simulations to model the cosmic-ray background in IACTs and evaluates the impact of different analysis techniques and detector configurations. The results show that cosmic-ray events can significantly affect the sensitivity of IACTs to gamma rays, and that careful background modeling and analysis techniques are crucial for obtaining accurate gamma-ray measurements. The study highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of cosmic-ray background in IACT observations and provides useful insights for optimizing future gamma-ray telescope designs.

The study also investigates the spatial distribution and properties of the identified sources, shedding light on the formation and evolution of the IC 348 nebula. Ultimately, this research contributes to our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of stars and planets in young stellar clusters.
55	The effective Lagrangian of electromagnetic fields at the cubic order in field strength has been considered. This generalized Lagrangian is motivated by electrodynamics on non-commutative spaces. We find the canonical and symmetrical energy-momentum tensors and show that they possess non-zero traces. The propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam in the external transverse magnetic field is investigated. We evaluate the induced ellipticity which allows us to obtain a constraint on parameters introduced from the PVLAS experimental data.
3688	We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.

Additionally, the equation of state for dense hydrogen shows agreement with experimental data and provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen in extreme environments. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the properties of matter at high pressures and temperatures.
968	Dynamics of Wilson loops in pure Yang-Mills theories is analyzed in terms of random walks of the holonomies of the gauge field on the gauge group manifold. It is shown that such random walks should necessarily be free. The distribution of steps of these random walks is related to the spectrum of string tensions of the theory and to certain cumulants of Yang-Mills curvature tensor. It turns out that when colour charges are completely screened, the holonomies of the gauge field can change only by the elements of the group center, which indicates that in the screening regime confinement persists due to thin center vortices. Thick center vortices are also considered and the emergence of such stepwise changes in the limits of infinitely thin vortices and infinitely large loops is demonstrated.
230	This research paper investigates the interplay between superfluidity and magnetism in multicomponent ultracold fermions. The authors use a mean-field approach to study the properties of the system, including the critical temperature for superfluidity and the behavior of the magnetization at low temperatures. They show that the presence of a magnetic field can significantly affect the superfluid behavior of the system, and that the competition between superfluidity and magnetism leads to interesting phase transitions. The authors also find that the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, with multiple phases characterized by different patterns of superfluidity and magnetization. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of considering both superfluidity and magnetism in the study of ultracold fermions, and provides insights into the behavior of these systems under different experimental conditions.
882	It is shown that only the maximally-symmetric spacetimes can be expressed in both the Robertson-Walker form and in static form - there are no other static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes. All possible static forms of the metric of the maximally-symmetric spacetimes are presented as a table. The findings are generalized to apply to functionally more general spacetimes: it is shown that the maximally symmetric spacetimes are also the only spacetimes that can be written in both orthogonal-time isotropic form and in static form.
576	For monotone linear differential systems with periodic coefficients, the (first) Floquet eigenvalue measures the growth rate of the system. We define an appropriate arithmetico-geometric time average of the coefficients for which we can prove that the Perron eigenvalue is smaller than the Floquet eigenvalue. We apply this method to Partial Differential Equations, and we use it for an age-structured systems of equations for the cell cycle. This opposition between Floquet and Perron eigenvalues models the loss of circadian rhythms by cancer cells.

1585	This research paper examines the charge redistribution at interfaces between YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and various metals. The main points of the paper include the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to analyze the electronic structure and chemical composition of the interfaces. The results show that charge transfer occurs at the interface due to the formation of an interfacial layer. The thickness and chemical composition of this layer depend on the metal used and the preparation conditions. The paper also discusses the implications of these findings for the performance of YBCO-based electronic devices. The significant conclusion is that charge redistribution at YBCO-metal interfaces affects the electronic properties of the interface and must be carefully considered in the design of YBCO-based devices.

This finding supports current theories of the early universe and provides new insights into the evolution of galaxies and the formation of the first stars.
1446	We prove John Hubbard's conjecture on the topological complexity of the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map. Indeed, we show that there exist several non-trivial loops in the locus which generate infinitely many mutually different monodromies. Our main tool is a rigorous computational algorithm for verifying the uniform hyperbolicity of chain recurrent sets. In addition, we show that the dynamics of the real H\'enon map is completely determined by the monodromy of a certain loop, providing the parameter of the map is contained in the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map.

The research concludes that the ERG method can be a powerful tool for studying quantum systems and provides a starting point for future research in this area.
1782	"In this work, we study the size of the particles involved in a powder snow avalanche phenomenon. To determine these sizes, we study all the phenomena the particles have to face before arriving in the ""body"" of the avalanche. We study the boundary layer which is at the bottom of the avalanche. We determine, with the help of experimental data, the range of size of the particles that can be entrained by the avalanche. We then examine the possibility for these particles to reach the top of the boundary layer, and so to take part in the avalanche. Our final result is that the more frequent particles suspended in a powder snow avalanche have a size lower than 200 micrometers."
2952	We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.

Additionally, the study concludes that the friction force plays a crucial role in the dynamics of celestial bodies and can significantly affect their orbits over long periods.

2012	Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the number of matches is known or not in advance.
2254	The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.
2936	We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems. We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal. We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to present.
3518	We analyze the branching ratios of B to D(*) + Ds0*(Ds1) decays using the factorization hypothesis. The B to D(*) transition form factors are taken from a model-independent analysis done by Caprini, Lellouch and Neubert based on heavy quark spin symmetry and dispersive constraints, including short-distance and power corrections. The leptonic decay constants fDs0* and fDs1 are calculated assuming a molecular structure for the Ds0* and Ds1 mesons. The calculated branching ratios of B-meson two-body decays are compared with experimental data and other theoretical results.
2979	The article discusses the relationship between cosmological singularities and a hypothetical correspondence between gravity and coset models. The authors propose that the singularity problem in cosmology can be resolved through this correspondence, which involves a mapping between gravity and certain types of mathematical structures called coset models. The article explores the theoretical basis for this correspondence and provides examples of how it might be applied in cosmology. The authors conclude that further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this conjectured correspondence, but that it has the potential to shed new light on the nature of singularities and their role in the evolution of the universe. Overall, the article presents an intriguing hypothesis that could have significant implications for our understanding of the cosmos.
1989	"We perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the TIP5P model to quantify structural order in both the first shell (defined by four nearest neighbors)and second shell (defined by twelve next-nearest neighbors) of a central water molecule. We find the anomalous decrease of orientational order upon compression occurs in both shells, but the anomalous decrease of translational order upon compression occurs {\it mainly in the second shell}. The decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression (""structural anomaly"") are thus correlated only in the second shell. Our findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second shell upon compression."

The proposed method can be useful for fault diagnosis in various industries, such as automotive and aerospace, ultimately leading to improved safety and reliability.
645	Single electron charging effects in a surface-gated InSb/AlInSb QW structure are reported. This material, due to its large g-factor and light effective mass, offers considerable advantages over more commonly used materials, such as GaAs, for quantum information processing devices. However, differences in material and device technology result in significant processing challenges. Simple Coulomb blockade and quantised confinement models are considered to explain the observation of conductance oscillations in these structures. The charging energy is found to be comparable with the energy spectrum for single particle states.
2820	This research paper focuses on the role of unphysical source terms in resonance line polarization transfer, specifically in the context of NLTE radiative transfer codes. The authors introduce a new mathematical framework, the Generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law, which allows for a more accurate description of this phenomenon. Through numerical simulations, they demonstrate the importance of including these unphysical source terms in NLTE radiative transfer codes and suggest that this can serve as an additional test of the accuracy of these codes. The main outcome of this research is the development of a more comprehensive understanding of resonance line polarization transfer, which has implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.
3991	An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.
331	In this paper I am presenting an overview on several topics related to nonequilibrium fluctuations in small systems. I start with a general discussion about fluctuation theorems and applications to physical examples extracted from physics and biology: a bead in an optical trap and single molecule force experiments. Next I present a general discussion on path thermodynamics and consider distributions of work/heat fluctuations as large deviation functions. Then I address the topic of glassy dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium fluctuations due to small cooperatively rearranging regions. Finally, I conclude with a brief digression on future perspectives.
3053	This research paper focuses on the photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5466, specifically on the characterization of its red giants and blue stragglers. Using data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster and identify the different populations of stars. Our results show a clear separation between the red giants and blue stragglers, with the latter being more concentrated towards the center of the cluster. We also investigate the possible formation mechanisms of these stars and discuss their implications for our understanding of globular cluster evolution. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the properties and dynamics of NGC 5466, and contributes to the broader field of stellar astrophysics.
439	We discuss the possibility that the strain field introduced by the structural supermodulation in Bi-2212 and certain other cuprate materials may modulate the superconducting pairing interaction. We calculate the amplitude of this effect, visible in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and thereby relate a change in the local superconducting gap with the change in the local dopant displacements induced by the supermodulation. In principle, since this modulation is periodic, sufficiently accurate x-ray measurements or ab initio calculations should enable one to determine which atomic displacements enhance pairing and therefore T_c.
979	"The research paper titled ""VIMOS spectroscopy of extended emission line regions"" focuses on the analysis of the spectroscopic properties of extended emission line regions in galaxies using the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument. The primary theme of the study is to provide insights into the physical conditions and kinematics of the ionized gas in these regions, and to investigate the possible mechanisms responsible for the observed emission lines. The research concludes that the extended emission line regions exhibit complex kinematic structures and multiple ionization mechanisms, indicating that they are likely the result of a combination of factors such as star formation, ionization by an active galactic nucleus, and shock excitation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of using VIMOS spectroscopy to better understand the properties of extended emission line regions in galaxies."

3201	A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter, for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences. Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.
3654	This research paper investigates the formation of quasi-solitons in transversely confined ferromagnetic film media. The authors conducted numerical simulations using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to show that the quasi-solitons are formed due to the interaction between the magnetization and the confinement potential. The study found that the size and shape of the confinement potential play an important role in the formation and dynamics of the quasi-solitons. The results of this study provide insights into the behavior of confined ferromagnetic films and may have potential applications in magnetic data storage and spintronics.
389	This research paper investigates the question of whether Killing-Yano tensors form a Lie algebra. Killing-Yano tensors have been extensively studied in the context of black hole physics, and their properties have important implications for the geometry of spacetime. In this study, we explore the Lie algebra structure of Killing-Yano tensors and determine whether they satisfy the Jacobi identity. We utilize a mathematical framework to analyze the Lie algebra structure and derive necessary conditions for Killing-Yano tensors to form a Lie algebra. Our analysis reveals that the answer to the question of whether Killing-Yano tensors form a Lie algebra is not straightforward and depends on the specific properties of the underlying geometry. The results of this study have implications for the understanding of black hole physics and the geometry of spacetime.
D2-66	Computational systems biology is crucial for understanding the complexity of biological systems through the integration of mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and data analysis. It enables researchers to study how genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways interact in a holistic manner, rather than in isolation. This approach is essential for deciphering the dynamics of biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic systems. The importance of computational systems biology lies in its ability to predict biological behaviors, identify potential drug targets, and develop personalized medicine strategies. It also helps in understanding diseases at a systems level, enabling the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.
2253	"The research paper titled ""Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations"" explores the relationship between protein mutational robustness and population size in evolutionary processes. The main focus of the study is to determine whether larger populations have a higher rate of mutations in proteins that confer increased robustness. The key findings suggest that larger populations have a higher rate of mutations that increase protein robustness, indicating that evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations. The study suggests that this phenomenon is due to the increased opportunity for beneficial mutations to spread and become fixed in larger populations. The conclusions of the paper highlight the importance of population size in evolutionary processes and the potential for mutational robustness to play a significant role in the adaptation of proteins to changing environments."
739	We propose a protocol to demonstrate the topological order of a spin-1/2 lattice model with four-body interactions. Unlike other proposals, it does not rely on the controlled movement of quasiparticles, thus eliminating the addressing, decoherence and dynamical phase problems related to them. Rather, the protocol profits from the degeneracy of the ground state. It involves the addition of Zeeman terms to the original Hamiltonian that are used to create holes and move them around in the system.
415	We prove that a number of classes of separable unital C*-algebras are closed under crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property, including: (1) AI algebras, AT algebras, and related classes characterized by direct limit decompositions using semiprojective building blocks. (2) Simple unital AH algebras with slow dimension growth and real rank zero. (3) C*-algebras with real rank zero or stable rank one. (4) C*-algebras whose quotients all satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Along the way, we give a systematic treatment of the derivation of direct limit decompositions from local approximation conditions by homomorphic images which are not necessarily injective.
1751	The research paper focuses on the basic principles of postgrowth annealing of CdTe:Cl ingot to obtain semi-insulating crystals. The study investigates the effects of annealing time and temperature on the electrical and structural properties of the crystals. The key findings suggest that a longer annealing time and higher temperature lead to an increase in the resistivity of the crystals, indicating a reduction in the concentration of free electrons. The study concludes that postgrowth annealing is an effective method for producing semi-insulating CdTe:Cl crystals with desirable electrical and structural properties.
284	The mechanism of carbon nanotube (CNT) nucleation and growth has been a mystery for over 15 years. Prior models have attempted the extension of older classical transport mechanisms. In July 2000, a more detailed and accurate nonclassical, relativistic mechanism was formulated considering the detailed dynamics of the electronics of spin and orbital rehybridization between the carbon and catalyst via novel mesoscopic phenomena and quantum dynamics. Ferromagnetic carbon was demonstrated. Here, quantum (Hall) effects and relativistic effects of intense many body spin-orbital interactions for novel orbital rehybridization dynamics (Little Effect) are proposed in this new dynamical magnetic mechanism. This dynamic ferromagnetic mechanism is proven by imposing dynamic and static magnetic fields during CNT syntheses and observing the different influence of these external magnetic environments on the catalyzing spin currents and spin waves and the resulting CNT formation.
1900	We investigate the dimerization and fusion of C60 molecules to form various C60 dimers when pushed against each other at several inter-molecular distances. We study the stability of this dimerized C60 molecule based on its binding strength provided by intramolecular interactions. Tersoff potential, which is considered to represent intramolecular interactions well, has been used to calculate potential energy at these distances of separation and for all possible orientations of the molecules. We observe that several minimum energy configurations exist at various distances between the C60 molecules. Our calculation shows that apart from the dumbbell structures, many interesting composite phases also result, such as fused, peanut and carbon nanotubes of geometry (5,5) and (10,0) of certain specific length.
3517	This review paper focuses on the current understanding of maser polarization and its relation to magnetic fields. It highlights the significant progress that has been made in recent years in observing and interpreting polarization in different maser types, including water, OH, and methanol masers. The paper also discusses the use of maser polarization as a diagnostic tool for studying magnetic fields in different astrophysical environments, such as star-forming regions and evolved stars. The review concludes with an outlook on the future prospects for maser polarization observations and their potential implications for understanding the magnetic universe.
1421	We compare the roles of fidelity and entanglement in characterizing renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions. It turns out that the scaling parameter extracted from fidelity for different ground states succeeds to capture nontrivial information including stable and unstable fixed points, whereas the von Neumann entropy as a bipartite entanglement measure (or equivalently, majorization relations satisfied by the spectra of the reduced density matrix along renormalization group flows) often fails, as far as the intrinsic irreversibility-information loss along renormalization group flows-is concerned. We also clarify an intimate connection between the von Neumman entropy, majorization relations, and fidelity. The relevance to Zamolodchikov's c theorem is indicated.
403	In a single-walled carbon nanotube, we observe the spin-1/2 Kondo effect. The energy of spin-resolved Kondo peaks is proportional to magnetic field at high fields, contrary to recent reports. At lower fields, the energy falls below this linear dependence, in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. For even electron occupancy, we observe a spin-1 Kondo effect due to the degeneracy of the triplet ground states. Tuning gate voltage within the same Coulomb diamond drives a transition to a singlet ground state. We also independently tune the energy difference between singlet and triplet states with a magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting thus measured confirms the value of the g-factor measured from the spin-1/2 Kondo feature.
1109	Face recognition is a widely researched topic, with neural networks (NNs) being one of the most effective methods for this task. In this paper, we compare the robustness of pairwise and multiclass NNs for face recognition. We evaluate the performance of both types of NNs on a large dataset of faces and compare their accuracy under various conditions, including changes in lighting, pose, and expression. Our results show that multiclass NNs outperform pairwise NNs in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially under challenging conditions. Furthermore, we find that multiclass NNs are more efficient in terms of memory and processing time, making them a better choice for real-time face recognition systems. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate and reliable face recognition systems using NNs.
807	We study thermodynamical properties of a fuzzy sphere in matrix quantum mechanics of the BFSS type including the Chern-Simons term. Various quantities are calculated to all orders in perturbation theory exploiting the one-loop saturation of the effective action in the large-N limit. The fuzzy sphere becomes unstable at sufficiently strong coupling, and the critical point is obtained explicitly as a function of the temperature. The whole phase diagram is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Above the critical point, we obtain perfect agreement with the all order results. In the region below the critical point, which is not accessible by perturbation theory, we observe the Hagedorn transition. In the high temperature limit our model is equivalent to a totally reduced model, and the relationship to previously known results is clarified.
1775	The research paper investigates the phenomenon of revival-collapse in the quadrature squeezing of the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model with binomial states. The authors explore the time evolution of the quadrature squeezing parameter and find that the revivals and collapses occur periodically, with the period depending on the number of photons and the coupling strength. They also analyze the effects of different initial conditions on the revival-collapse phenomenon. The study provides insights into the behavior of quantum systems and may have potential applications in quantum information processing and communication.
3761	Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.
3951	This research paper investigates the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of spin transfer torque and microwave generation in magnetic tunnel junctions utilizing a spin valve structure. The results show that the angular dependence of the spin transfer torque can be controlled by the shape of the magnetic tunnel junction, which affects the microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study concludes that the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque is a significant factor in controlling microwave generation without a magnetic field, which has potential applications in spintronics and nanoelectronics.
529	We derive an approach to define the causal direction of the wavevector of modes in optical metamaterials, which in turn, determines signs of refractive index and impedance as a function of {\it real and imaginary} parts of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. We use the developed technique to demonstrate that the interplay between resonant response of constituents of metamaterials can be used to achieve efficient dispersion management. Finally we demonstrate broadband dispersion-less index and impedance matching in active nanowire-based negative index materials. Our work opens new practical applications of negative index composites for broadband lensing, imaging, and pulse-routing.
102	Abstract: Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a sender to send one out of two messages to a receiver without revealing which message was sent. Key exchange is another essential cryptographic primitive that enables two parties to establish a shared secret key for secure communication. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for oblivious transfer based on key exchange. Our protocol achieves the same security properties as traditional OT protocols while leveraging the efficiency and simplicity of key exchange protocols. We provide a detailed security analysis and implementation of our protocol, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency. Our results suggest that our protocol can be a viable alternative to traditional OT protocols in scenarios where key exchange is already being used.
3959	This research paper investigates the impact of environmental noise on the performance of holonomic quantum gates and proposes a method for reducing noise to improve gate fidelity. The study utilized numerical simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different noise reduction techniques, including dynamical decoupling and optimal control. The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the impact of noise on holonomic gates, leading to improved gate performance and increased robustness against environmental disturbances. The study concludes that noise reduction is essential for achieving high-fidelity holonomic gates, which are critical for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
752	This research paper explores the structure of the quenched QCD vacuum using overlap fermions. The primary theme of the study is to understand the properties of the vacuum in terms of topological objects like instantons and monopoles. The findings suggest that the overlap fermions can accurately capture the topological properties of the vacuum and provide a useful tool for studying the QCD vacuum structure. The study also concludes that the topological charge density distribution of the vacuum is highly non-uniform and dominated by instantons and anti-instantons. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the structure of the QCD vacuum and its role in understanding the properties of hadrons.

The key outcomes of this study include a detailed understanding of the Hartree-Fock method, its applications, and its potential for future research. Overall, this research emphasizes the importance of mathematical and computational tools in advancing quantum chemistry research.
171	Red supergiant stars represent a key phase in the evolution of massive stars. Recent radiative hydrodynamic simulations suggest that their atmospheres may be the location of large-scale convective motions. As supergiant convection is expected to generate supersonic motions and shocks, we seek constraints on these atmospheric motions and their possible relation with mass-loss rates. We present high-resolution, visible spectroscopy of a sample of red supergiants (spectral type M I) and analyse them with a tomographic technique. We observe steep velocity gradients, characterising both upward and downward supersonic motions, which are time variable on time scales of a few hundred days. These convective motions will generate turbulent pressure, which will strongly decrease the effective gravity. We suggest that this decrease, combined with radiative pressure on molecular lines, initiate the mass loss in red supergiant stars.
3174	Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.
2169	This research paper aims to explore the possibility of learning more from the Lorentz transformations, which have been a cornerstone of special relativity for over a century. The paper examines the history of the transformations and their role in modern physics, as well as current research in the field. Through an analysis of various approaches to studying the Lorentz transformations, the paper argues that there is still much to be learned from this fundamental concept. The research also proposes new avenues for investigating the transformations, including the use of computational methods and experimental measurements. Ultimately, this paper provides insights into the potential for uncovering new knowledge and understanding in the field of special relativity through a deeper exploration of the Lorentz transformations.
1418	This research paper focuses on the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions, particularly in the context of the quantum Ising model in a transverse field.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying quantum critical phenomena using a variety of different approaches in order to gain a more complete understanding of these complex phenomena.

The authors investigate the relationship between the specific heat and the superconducting transition in these materials, and present experimental data that suggests the existence of a second discontinuity in the specific heat curve. They propose a theoretical model that explains this phenomenon and discuss the implications of their findings for the understanding of superconductivity. The paper concludes that the second discontinuity in the specific heat represents a new aspect of the superconducting phase transition and opens up new avenues for research in this field.
3798	This research paper investigates biased random walks on combs, which are a class of graphs with a central spine connected to multiple branches. The main objectives of this study are to analyze the behavior of biased random walks on combs and to understand how the bias affects the walk's properties. The researchers used theoretical analysis and simulations to study the impact of the bias on the walk's hitting time, cover time, and first-passage time. The key findings indicate that the bias can significantly affect the walk's behavior, and the optimal bias depends on the comb's structure. The researchers concluded that understanding the behavior of biased random walks on combs is crucial for designing efficient algorithms in network routing, search algorithms, and graph theory.
510	"This research paper investigates a newly discovered conformation of double stranded DNA, dubbed the ""Z-DNA"" conformation, which is characterized by a left-handed helix structure. The study aims to explore the stability and functional significance of this unusual DNA structure, and its potential impact on gene expression and regulation. Through a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and computational approaches, the researchers demonstrate that Z-DNA is a stable and dynamic conformation that can form in vivo under specific conditions. Furthermore, they show that Z-DNA can act as a regulatory element in gene expression, potentially modulating transcription and translation processes. Overall, this study sheds new light on the complexity and diversity of DNA structures and their biological functions, with implications for our understanding of genetic processes and disease mechanisms."
894	This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally quantized.
D2-45	Educational robotics teaches the design, analysis, application and operation of robots. Robots include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles. Educational robotics can be taught from elementary school to graduate programs. Robotics may also be used to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design. Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.

2484	This research paper investigates the generation of curvature perturbations in the context of a multiple field ekpyrotic collapse. The main objective is to explore how the dynamics of the fields within this model affects the power spectrum of the generated perturbations. The study uses a scalar field theory and employs the delta N formalism to calculate the curvature perturbations. The results indicate that the presence of multiple fields can lead to a significant enhancement of the power spectrum, particularly at small scales. Additionally, the study finds that the introduction of a non-minimal coupling between the fields can further amplify the perturbations. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early universe and the generation of primordial perturbations.
2960	We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of models of lattice polygons, mainly on the square lattice. In particular, we focus on limiting area laws in the uniform perimeter ensemble where, for fixed perimeter, each polygon of a given area occurs with the same probability. We relate limit distributions to the scaling behaviour of the associated perimeter and area generating functions, thereby providing a geometric interpretation of scaling functions. To a major extent, this article is a pedagogic review of known results.
3588	Special solutions of string theory in supercritical dimensions can interpolate in time between theories with different numbers of spacetime dimensions (via dimension quenching) and different amounts of worldsheet supersymmetry (via c-duality). These solutions connect supercritical string theories to the more familiar string duality web in ten dimensions, and provide a precise link between supersymmetric and purely bosonic string theories. Dimension quenching and c-duality appear to be natural concepts in string theory, giving rise to large networks of interconnected theories. We describe some of these networks in detail and discuss general consistency constraints on the types of transitions that arise in this framework.
834	We study the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium of magnetic flux tubes with circular cross sections embedded in a magnetic surrounding atmosphere. We solve the static momentum equation in 2.5D to obtain the thermodynamics that are consistent with a prescribed velocity and magnetic fields. We show that force balance is roughly satisfied if the flux tube's magnetic field is aligned with its axis. Equilibrium is guaranteed if this magnetic field possesses a transverse component. Several forms of this transverse field are investigated. The resulting magnetic field configurations are critically reviewed in terms of the results from spectropolarimetric observations. The thermodynamic structure that allows the flux tube to be in mechanical equilibrium is also calculated. We show that the inferred pressure, density and temperature stratification reproduce intensity features similar to dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains.
1565	The blow-up in finite time for the solutions to the initial-boundary value problem associated to the multi-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a bounded domain is proved. The model consists on conservation of mass equation and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible Euler equations corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance. The proof is based on a-priori estimates for the energy functional for a new observable constructed with an auxiliary function, and it is shown that, under suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data, the solution blows up after a finite time.
3054	We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the performance gains offered by random network coding.
3855	"The research paper titled ""Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC"" focuses on the search for particles called sbottoms at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN.

Overall, the research highlights the importance of continued exploration and development of advanced techniques in particle physics research."
3464	The mysterious `dark energy' needed to explain the current observations, poses a serious confrontation between fundamental physics and cosmology. The present crisis may be an outcome of the (so far untested) prediction of the general theory of relativity that the pressure of the matter source also gravitates. In this view, a theoretical analysis reveals some surprising inconsistencies and paradoxes faced by the energy-stress tensor (in the presence of pressure) which is used to model the matter content of the universe, including dark energy.
2957	The Flory-Huggins theory has been widely used to predict the solubility of polymers in solution. However, this theory has limited applicability to heterogeneously-modified polymers due to the lack of a clear understanding of the intermolecular interactions of the modified segments. This paper explores the use of the Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified polymers and proposes modifications to the theory to account for these interactions. The study includes both theoretical and experimental approaches to validate the proposed modifications and demonstrates the improved accuracy of the modified Flory-Huggins theory in predicting the solubility behavior of heterogeneously-modified polymers. This research provides insight into the behavior of complex polymer systems and could have implications for the design of new materials with tailored properties.
2662	Path integrals similar to those describing stiff polymers arise in the Helfrich model for membranes. We show how these types of path integrals can be evaluated and apply our results to study the thermodynamics of a minority stripe phase in a bulk membrane. The fluctuation induced contribution to the line tension between the stripe and the bulk phase is computed, as well as the effective interaction between the two phases in the tensionless case where the two phases have differing bending rigidities.

2837	Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.

555	The mechanics of cells is strongly affected by molecular motors that generate forces in the cellular cytoskeleton. We develop a model for cytoskeletal networks driven out of equilibrium by molecular motors exerting transient contractile stresses. Using this model we show how motor activity can dramatically increase the network's bulk elastic moduli. We also show how motor binding kinetics naturally leads to enhanced low-frequency stress fluctuations that result in non-equilibrium diffusive motion within an elastic network, as seen in recent \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo} experiments.
3333	This research paper focuses on the small-scale aspects of flows in the proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface.

620	Controlled Lagrangian and matching techniques are developed for the stabilization of relative equilibria and equilibria of discrete mechanical systems with symmetry as well as broken symmetry. Interesting new phenomena arise in the controlled Lagrangian approach in the discrete context that are not present in the continuous theory. In particular, to make the discrete theory effective, one can make an appropriate selection of momentum levels or, alternatively, introduce a new parameter into the controlled Lagrangian to complete the kinetic matching procedure. Specifically, new terms in the controlled shape equation that are necessary for potential matching in the discrete setting are introduced. The theory is illustrated with the problem of stabilization of the cart-pendulum system on an incline. The paper also discusses digital and model predictive controllers.
560	We review the decomposition method of stock return cross-correlations, presented previously for studying the dependence of the correlation coefficient on the resolution of data (Epps effect). Through a toy model of random walk/Brownian motion and memoryless renewal process (i.e. Poisson point process) of observation times we show that in case of analytical treatability, by decomposing the correlations we get the exact result for the frequency dependence. We also demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable fitting of the dependence of correlations on the data resolution in case of empirical data. Our results indicate that the Epps phenomenon is a product of the finite time decay of lagged correlations of high resolution data, which does not scale with activity. The characteristic time is due to a human time scale, the time needed to react to news.
2909	I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans. I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.

1714	"Fourier phases contain a vast amount of information about structure in direct space, that most statistical tools never tap into. We address ALMA's ability to detect and recover this information, using the probability distribution function (PDF) of phase increments, and the related concepts of phase entropy and phase structure quantity. We show that ALMA, with its high dynamical range, is definitely needed to achieve significant detection of phase structure, and that it will do so even in the presence of a fair amount of atmospheric phase noise. We also show that ALMA should be able to recover the actual ""amount"" of phase structure in the noise-free case, if multiple configurations are used."
177	Pumping of charge current by spin dynamics in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction is theoretically studied. Considering disordered electron, the exchange coupling and spin-orbit interactions are treated perturbatively. It is found that dominant current induced by the spin dynamics is interpreted as a consequence of the conversion from spin current via the inverse spin Hall effect. We also found that the current has an additional component from a fictitious conservative field. Results are applied to the case of moving domain wall.

D2-4	Many cross sectional and prospective studies have confirmed the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese: more than 85% of people with type 2 diabetes in southeast Scotland in 2005 had a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared) of over 25. Recent evidence indicates that high waist circumference may be an even better indicator than body mass index (BMI) of increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes over a 14 year follow-up period in the nurses' health study was 49 times higher among women whose baseline BMI was >35 than among women whose baseline BMI was <22.
2173	"The research paper titled ""New Jarlskog determinant from Physics above the GUT Scale"" explores the Jarlskog invariant in the context of physics beyond the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale.

It makes it possible to solve 3D problems within reasonable CPU time even when considering complex equations of state. The algorithm is given after first a brief description of the previously existing algorithm to solve for supercritical fluids. The side and bottom heated near critical carbon dioxide filled cavity problems are respectively solved and compared to the previously obtained results.
2494	The high multiplicity of massive stars in dense, young clusters is established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.

The effective operator is obtained by first integrating out all the fermionic modes in the fixed gauge background, and then identifying the contribution from the localized modes as the determinant of an operator in one dimension less. We define physically relevant degrees of freedom on the defect by introducing an auxiliary defect-bound fermion field and integrating out the original five dimensional bulk field.

1172	Recent experimental work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions have revealed quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization which is fractional in the bipolar regime and integer in the unipolar regime in terms of quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime the electron and hole modes can mix at the p-n boundary, leading to current partition and quantized shot noise plateaus similar to those of conductance, while in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle-hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.
2376	Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin effects.

The conclusion of this research is that the semiclassical theory provides a more refined and accurate description of the pairing-gap fluctuations in superconductors.

In this research paper, we explore efficient model chemistries for peptides using split-valence Gaussian basis sets and the heterolevel approximation in both restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and second-order M ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). We demonstrate that the heterolevel approximation can significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining high accuracy in RHF calculations. Additionally, we show that the use of split-valence basis sets can improve the accuracy of MP2 calculations while also reducing the computational cost. Overall, our findings suggest that these model chemistries can provide efficient and accurate simulations of peptides, making them valuable tools for drug discovery and other biochemical applications.
1672	In a series of recent papers, a new formalism has been developed that explains the inner structure of dark matter halos as collisionless, dissipationless systems assembled through mergers and accretion at the typical cosmological rate. Nearby ellipticals are also collisionless, dissipationless systems assembling their mass through mergers, but contrarily to the former structures they do not continuously accrete external matter because they are shielded by their host halos. Here we explore the idea that the infall of their own matter ejected within the halo on the occasion of a violent merger can play a role similar to external accretion in halos. The predicted stellar mass density profile fits the observed one, and the empirical total mass density profile is also recovered.

3568	Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators. One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.

We obtain the largest ferroelectric polarization observed in the whole class of improper magnetic ferroelectrics to date. We find that the two proposed mechanisms for FE in multiferroics, lattice- and electronic-based, are simultaneously active in this compound: a large portion of the ferroelectric polarization arises due to quantum-mechanical effects of electron orbital polarization, in addition to the conventional polar atomic displacements. An interesting mechanism for switching the magnetoelectric domains by an electric field via a 180-degree coherent rotation of Mn spins is also proposed.

3369	We briefly discuss our recent field-theoretic study of polyelectrolyte complexation, which occurs in solutions of two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Charged systems require theoretical methods beyond the mean-field (or self-consistent field) approximation; indeed, mean-field theory is qualitatively incorrect for such polyelectrolyte solutions. Both analytical (one-loop) and numerical (complex Langevin) methods to account for charge correlations are discussed. In particular, the first application of field-theoretic simulations to polyelectrolyte systems is reported. The polyelectrolyte charge-charge correlation length and a phase diagram are provided; effects of charge redistribution are qualitatively explored.
3922	We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid. The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading failures.

958	Web page ranking and collaborative filtering require the optimization of sophisticated performance measures. Current Support Vector approaches are unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem, which can be solved by the Hungarian Marriage algorithm. At test time, a sort operation is sufficient, as our algorithm assigns a relevance score to every (document, query) pair. Experiments show that the our algorithm is fast and that it works very well.

The tool incorporates an efficient representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of quantum computational tree logic (QCTL). The model-checking procedure treats quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.
477	The recently proposed theoretical model of superconductors endowed with two distinct superconducting phases and critical temperatures is further analyzed by introducing two distinct order parameters, described by two scalar fields which condensate at different temperatures. We find some deviations in basic thermodynamical quantities with respect to the Ginzburg-Landau one-phase superconductors. In particular, by contrast to the usual case where only one jump in specific heat takes place at the normal-superconductor transition temperature, we actually predict an additional discontinuity for C_V when passing from a superconducting phase to the other one.

3988	Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field- emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field responsible for the field emission.

Ultimately, this research advances our knowledge of the fundamental physics behind magnetic reconnection and contributes to the development of more accurate models and predictions of space weather phenomena.
3898	We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.

3125	Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfully represented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complex number field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') are found for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictly or non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Lie algebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749; math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40, 113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independent invariants and their form, is corroborated.
3029	We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving on a generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requires an accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the moving charge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergent finite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation also requires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular on the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum regularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presents the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.
3334	A complete thermodynamical analysis of the 2+1 dimensional massless Gross-Neveu model is performed using the optimized perturbation theory. This is a non-perturbative method that allows us to go beyond the known large-N results already at lowest order. Our results, for a finite number of fermion species, N, show the existence of a tricritical point in the temperature and chemical potential phase diagram for discrete chiral phase transition allowing us to precisely to locate it. By studying the phase diagram in the pressure and inverse density plane, we also show the existence of a liquid-gas phase, which, so far, was unknown to exist in this model. Finally, we also derive N dependent analytical expressions for the fermionic mass, critical temperature and critical chemical potential.

665	A recent, major, puzzle in the core-level photoemission spectra of doped manganites is the observation of a 1-2 eV wide shoulder with intensity varying with temperature T as the square of the magnetization over a T scale of order 200K, an order of magnitude less than electronic energies. This is addressed and resolved here, by extending a recently proposed two electron fluid l-b model for these systems to include core-hole effects. The shoulder arises from a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the highly localized (l) and band-like (b) states. Furthermore, our theory leads to a correspondence between spectral changes due to increasing doping and decreasing T, as experimentally observed.
3211	Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3 film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite oxide hetero-interfaces.

3850	Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed.

The outcomes highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical structures governing the motion of dust particles in rotating systems and provide insights into the dynamics of astrophysical objects such as galaxies. Ultimately, the study contributes to the broader field of astrophysics by enhancing our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of celestial objects.
2238	Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides evidence that nonlocal electrodynamics governs the magnetic field penetration in an extreme low-k superconductor. The sample is an indium film with a large elastic mean free path (11 mkm) deposited on a silicon oxide wafer. It is shown that PNR can resolve the difference between the reflected neutron spin asymmetries predicted by the local and nonlocal theories of superconductivity. The experimental data support the nonlocal theory, which predicts a nonmonotonic decay of the magnetic field.

The technique furnishes a universal, topological foundation for the partial differential equations of hydrodynamics and electrodynamics; the technique does not depend upon a metric, connection or a variational principle. Certain topological classes of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are shown to be equivalent to thermodynamically irreversible processes.

We use the unique factorization of a connected graph into the product of prime graphs given by Sabidussi to find explicit formulas for labeled and unlabeled prime graphs. In the case of species, we construct the exponential composition of species based on the arithmetic product of species of Maia and M\'endez and the quotient species, and express the species of connected graphs as the exponential composition of the species of prime graphs.
159	We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability obtained by optimal schemes.
1868	We find exact solutions to the Dirac equation in D-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Using these solutions we analytically calculate the de Sitter quasinormal (QN) frequencies of the Dirac field. For the massive Dirac field this computation is similar to that previously published for massive fields of half-integer spin moving in four dimensions. However to calculate the QN frequencies of the massless Dirac field we must use distinct methods in odd and even dimensions, therefore the computation is different from that already known for other massless fields of integer spin.

Overall, this study highlights the significance of the intersection of quantum mechanics and polymer science and its potential impact on materials research and development.
48	The low-snr capacity of M-ary PSK transmission over both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero snr are obtained. The spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.

The study findings reveal that U-max is a powerful and efficient tool for analyzing data with small sample sizes and non-normal distributions. The paper concludes that U-max can be a valuable alternative to parametric tests and recommends its use in a variety of research settings."
178	This research paper investigates the charge current driven by spin dynamics in a disordered Rashba spin-orbit system. The study employs a combination of analytical and numerical methods to examine the interplay between spin dynamics and disorder in the system. The results indicate that disorder enhances the spin current, while the charge current is driven by the spin dynamics. The outcomes of the study have significant implications for the design and optimization of spintronic devices. Overall, this research sheds light on the fundamental physics of spin transport in disordered systems and offers insights into potential technological applications.
2489	The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.
1902	We study the behaviour of the C60 molecule under very high internal or external pressure using Tersoff as well as Brenner potentials. As a result, we estimate the critical internal and external pressures that lead to its instability. We also calculate stretching force constant and bulk modulus of this molecule at several pressures under which the molecule remains stable. The values of these estimated here at zero pressure agree closely with those obtained in earlier calculations. We also observe that at high pressures, a finite value of parameter of Tersoff potential gives physically acceptable results in contrast to its value zero, which is usually taken for the carbon systems.
1220	"The research paper ""Plastic-damage model for concrete in principal directions"" presents a new model for predicting the behavior of concrete material under different loading conditions. The model is based on a plastic-damage framework and takes into account the anisotropic nature of the material. The study focuses on the principal directions of concrete, which are the directions of maximum and minimum material strength. The model is validated through experimental data and numerical simulations, which show good agreement with the predicted behavior. The results indicate that the proposed model can accurately predict the damage evolution and failure behavior of concrete in principal directions. The study concludes that the plastic-damage model can be a useful tool for predicting the behavior of concrete structures under different loading conditions and can aid in the design of more resilient and durable structures."
684	"The research paper titled ""Extra energy coupling through subwavelength hole arrays via stochastic resonance"" focuses on the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in subwavelength hole arrays. The study aims to investigate how external noise can enhance the energy transfer through these arrays. The authors conducted simulations and experiments to demonstrate the existence of stochastic resonance in subwavelength hole arrays and showed that the resonance could be tuned by adjusting the external noise level. Their findings suggest that stochastic resonance can be utilized to improve the performance of energy harvesting devices and other nanoscale systems. The paper concludes that the impact of stochastic resonance on energy transfer in subwavelength hole arrays has significant implications for the design and performance of nanoscale devices."
3589	This research paper explores the current landscape of supercritical string theory, a theoretical framework that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Through a thorough review of literature and analysis of recent developments in the field, we provide an overview of the key concepts and mathematical structures that underpin supercritical string theory. We also examine the challenges and open questions facing researchers in this area, including the role of supersymmetry, the nature of extra dimensions, and the relationship between string theory and other branches of physics. Our analysis sheds light on the current state of the field and provides a roadmap for future research in this exciting and rapidly evolving area of theoretical physics.
693	Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology' approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger. I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of stability of biological order.
3088	Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h), we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.
974	"We investigate the behaviour of an original traffic model. The model considers a single multi-lane street, populated by autonomous vehicles directed from either end to the other. Lanes have no intrinsic directionality, and the vehicles are inserted at random at either end and any lane. Collision avoidance is fully automatic and, to enhance the transport capacity of the street, vehicles form_trains_ in which they may travel at high speed quite close to the vehicle in front. We report on the transit times for vehicles under a wide variety of conditions: vehicle insertion probability & imbalance and their maximum speed distribution. We also outline an interesting feature of the model, that the complex interactions of many vehicles are considerably more powerful than a simple ""keep left"" directive which each vehicle should obey."
785	We analyse the static solutions of attractive Bose-Einstein condensates under transverse confinement, both with and without axial confinement. By full numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and variational methods we map out the condensate solutions, their energetic properties, and their critical points for instability. With no axial confinement a bright solitary wave solution will tend to decay by dispersion unless the interaction energy is close to the critical value for collapse. In contrast, with axial confinement the only decay mechanism is collapse. The stability of a bright solitary wave solution increases with higher radial confinement. Finally we consider the stability of dynamical states containing up to four solitons and find good agreement with recent experiments.
1344	"The article titled ""Extrinsic Size Effect in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy of Thin Films"" discusses the influence of sample size on the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement of thin films. PFM is a technique used to measure the electromechanical response of materials at the nanoscale level. The study examines the extrinsic size effect, which occurs when the size of the sample affects the measured PFM signals. The authors found that the extrinsic size effect is significant in thin films with thicknesses below 100 nm and that it can be attributed to the interaction between the sample and the PFM tip. The study provides insights into the limitations of PFM measurements and the importance of carefully choosing the sample size for accurate results."
1439	This research paper investigates the role of impurity scattering in the electronic properties of graphene, using the well-known Mott's formula to analyze the scattering effect on the electrical conductivity. The study shows that impurity scattering can significantly modify the conductivity of graphene, leading to a decrease in the conductivity as the impurity concentration increases. Furthermore, the results suggest that the impurity scattering effect can be controlled by tuning the Fermi level of graphene. This work provides important insights into the fundamental electronic properties of graphene and has implications for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.
1378	This research paper investigates the dipole binding in a cosmic string background caused by quantum anomalies. Using a nonperturbative approach, the authors found that the dipole coupling is sensitive to the string's tension and the anomaly coefficient. They also discovered that the dipole binding energy is proportional to the string's tension and increases logarithmically with the distance between the particles. These findings shed light on the impact of quantum anomalies on the behavior of particles in cosmic string backgrounds and may have implications for the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.
3184	We introduce a procedure developed by the ``Teramo Stellar Populations Tools'' group (Teramo-SPoT), specifically optimized to obtain realistic simulations of CCD images of elliptical galaxies. Particular attention is devoted to include the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) signal observed in ellipticals and to simulate the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy, and the distribution of background galaxies present in real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated objects - galaxy distance and brightness profile, luminosity function of GC and background galaxies, etc. - the tool presented allows the user to set some of the main instrumental properties - FoV, zero point magnitude, exposure time, etc.
476	This research paper investigates the formation of shear-strain-induced super-lattice structures on graphite through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging. The study shows that these structures result from the sliding of graphene layers, leading to a spatially varying distribution of the super-lattice. The authors propose a model to explain the observed patterns based on the interaction between the graphene layers and the substrate. This study sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of super-lattice structures in layered materials and provides new insights into the role of shear strain in their creation.
1212	This research paper delves into the question of whether there are any cross-interactions between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field. The study uses mathematical models to explore the theoretical possibilities of such interactions and analyzes experimental data to determine if they exist in the physical world. The results of this research have implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature and provide insights into the behavior of quantum particles. Ultimately, this study sheds light on a complex and important topic in the field of physics and contributes to the ongoing quest for a unified theory of everything.
39	This document reports on a series of experimental and theoretical studies conducted to assess the astro-particle physics potential of three future large-scale particle detectors proposed in Europe as next generation underground observatories. The proposed apparatus employ three different and, to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid Argon TPC), LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (\WC), based on the use of large mass of liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter instability, the detection of astrophysical- and geo-neutrinos and to the possible use of these detectors in future high-intensity neutrino beams.
2398	We consider quantum field theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, with the position coordinates represented by twistors instead of the usual world-vectors. Upon imposing canonical commutation relations between twistors and dual twistors, quantum theory of fields described by non-holomorphic functions of twistor variables becomes manifestly non-commutative, with Lorentz symmetry broken by a time-like vector. We discuss the free field propagation and its impact on the short- and long-distance behavior of physical amplitudes in perturbation theory. In the ultraviolet limit, quantum field theories in twistor space are generically less divergent than their commutative counterparts. Furthermore, there is no infrared--ultraviolet mixing problem.
2076	"The motivations to make ultraviolet (UV) studies of supernovae (SNe) are reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for ""dark energy"" that seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed."
2775	This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission (PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.
160	There is a large literature devoted to the problem of finding an optimal (min-cost) prefix-free code with an unequal letter-cost encoding alphabet of size. While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to optimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon the largest encoding letter size. This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the encoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the previous analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm that works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite alphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best previous ones known.
2948	Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.
1274	We present the results of six-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 3C~66A. The high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) maps obtained at multi-frequency (2.3, 8.4, and 22.2 GHz) simultaneously enabled us to identify the brightest compact component with the core. We find that the spectrum of the core can be reasonably fitted by the synchrotron self-absorption model. Our VLBA maps show that the jet of 3C~66A has two bendings at about 1.2 and 4 mas from the core. We also give possible identifications of our jet components with the components in previous VLBA observations by analysing their proper motions. We find consistent differences of the position from the core in one component between different frequencies at six epochs.
3820	"This research paper explores the relationship between linkedness and ordered cycles in directed graphs (digraphs). The primary focus is on characterizing the minimum number of linked vertices required to contain all ordered cycles of a digraph. The authors introduce a concept called ""ordered cycle number"" to measure this quantity and provide upper and lower bounds for it. They also investigate the properties of digraphs with a small ordered cycle number and provide examples of digraphs with different ordered cycle numbers. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of the structure and complexity of digraphs by providing insights into the interplay between linkedness and ordered cycles."
D2-51	"The Big Bang theory is the predominant scientific explanation for our universe's origin, describing not an explosion but rather how the universe expanded from an initial state of extreme density and temperature approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial state, called a singularity, contained all matter in an incredibly hot, dense point before expansion began. Proposed by physicist Georges Lemaître in 1927, the theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (essentially the Big Bang's ""afterglow"") and the abundance of light elements in the universe. Later refinements include cosmic inflation theory, suggesting that the early universe briefly expanded faster than light speed."
265	We study the computation of the static quark potential under decimations in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG). Employing a multi-representation plaquette action, we find that fine-tuning the decimation prescription so that the MCRG equilibrium self-consistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances. In particular, lattice coarsening (change of effective lattice spacing on action-generated lattices after decimation) is nearly eliminated. Failure to correctly tune the decimation, on the other hand, produces large coarsening effects, of order 50% or more, consistent with those seen in previous studies. We also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances, where no particular improvement is seen for this action.
3725	From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.
2956	Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insoluble base materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such polymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a polymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the synthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation of such systems.
3747	In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
1869	The paper focuses on studying the Dirac quasinormal modes of a D-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The authors use a numerical method to calculate the quasinormal frequencies and investigate their dependence on the dimensions of the spacetime and the mass of the Dirac field. They find that the quasinormal frequencies for the Dirac field are different from those of a scalar field, which has been previously studied. The authors also discuss the physical implications of their results, including the potential for future observations of these quasinormal frequencies in astrophysical contexts. Overall, the paper provides new insights into the behavior of Dirac fields in de Sitter spacetime and their potential observational signatures.
189	This research paper discusses the Inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata Algorithm and its application in developing small decoders for Algebraic-Geometric Codes. The algorithm is a significant improvement over the traditional Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which requires matrix inversion, and thus reduces computational complexity. The paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm and its practical implementation. The results indicate that the algorithm is effective in terms of decoding capability and computational efficiency. The proposed small decoder is also shown to be highly efficient in decoding Algebraic-Geometric Codes. Overall, this research offers a novel solution that can significantly reduce the computational complexity of decoding Algebraic-Geometric Codes.
742	This paper explores critical phenomena in complex networks, with a primary focus on understanding the behavior of such systems near the critical point of a phase transition. The authors investigate various network models and observe the emergence of power-law behaviors in the degree distributions and correlation functions. They also discuss the implications of these findings for the robustness and functionality of complex networks, highlighting the importance of understanding critical phenomena in the study and design of networked systems. Overall, the paper provides insights into the nature and behavior of complex networks, with potential applications in fields ranging from physics to computer science and beyond.
2882	We compare the dependences on the number of colors of the leading pion pion scattering amplitudes using the single index quark field and two index quark fields. These are seen to have different relationships to the scattering amplitudes suggested by chiral dynamics which can explain the long puzzling pion pion s wave scattering up to about 1 GeV. This may be interesting for getting a better understanding of the large Nc approach as well as for application to recently proposed technicolor models.
2647	"One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D\""ur-Cirac (DC) method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems, there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled fraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial transposition."
2019	Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis is a theoretical framework that investigates the role of flavour symmetry in generating the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In this research paper, the authors propose a new model that incorporates flavour-dependent effects into Type II leptogenesis, which is a mechanism that generates a net lepton number asymmetry through the decay of heavy particles. The authors show that the model can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and that the flavour-dependent effects play a crucial role in this process. The proposed model also predicts new phenomena that can be tested in future experiments, providing a promising avenue for exploring the fundamental physics underlying the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.
77	The existence of magnetosonic solitons in dusty plasmas is investigated. The nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations for a warm dusty magnetoplasma are thus derived. A solution of the nonlinear equations is presented. It is shown that, due to the presence of dust, static structures are allowed. This is in sharp contrast to the formation of the so called shocklets in usual magnetoplasmas. A comparatively small number of dust particles can thus drastically alter the behavior of the nonlinear structures in magnetized plasmas.
3066	This research paper investigates the polarization properties of subwavelength hole arrays composed of rectangular holes. The study explores the effects of the angle of incidence and the dimensions of the holes on the transmission and polarization properties of the arrays. The results demonstrate that the polarization properties of the arrays are highly dependent on the shape and orientation of the holes. The study also suggests that subwavelength hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes can be utilized for controlling the polarization of light in a variety of optical devices. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of subwavelength hole arrays for applications in polarization-sensitive optical systems.
3834	"The paper ""Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry"" presents a new approach to solving algebraic geometry problems using saturated and positive integer programming. The authors introduce the concept of a ""flip"" in algebraic geometry and propose a method for computing flips using these techniques. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to several examples in representation theory, including the computation of the Gromov-Witten invariants for the Grassmannian variety. The paper concludes by discussing the potential implications of this work for the field of algebraic geometry and its applications in other areas of mathematics."
3450	The paper investigates the non-uniform convergence of two-photon decay rates for excited atomic states. The authors demonstrate that the decay rates do not necessarily converge uniformly, and they present a theoretical framework for understanding this phenomenon. They also provide numerical examples to illustrate the non-uniform convergence and show that it can have significant implications for experimental measurements. The paper concludes that careful consideration must be given to the non-uniform convergence of two-photon decay rates when interpreting experimental data and designing future experiments.
3574	The research paper focuses on the kinematic design of a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-dof) hybrid manipulator, which combines the advantages of both serial and parallel manipulators. The authors present the mathematical model of the manipulator and derive its kinematic equations, which are used to analyze its motion characteristics. They also propose a novel approach for optimizing the manipulator's workspace using a genetic algorithm. The results of the study show that the proposed manipulator has a large workspace and good motion performance, making it suitable for various applications in industry and automation. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid manipulators.
1138	We discuss how all variant 10d and 11d maximal supergravities, including star supergravities and supergravities in different signatures, can be obtained as different real slices of three complex actions. As an application we study the recently introduced domain-wall/cosmology correspondence in this approach. We give an example in 9d and 10d where the domain-wall and corresponding cosmology can be viewed as different real slices of the same complex solution. We argue how in this case the pseudo-supersymmetry of the cosmological solutions can be understood as the invariance under supersymmetry of a variant supergravity.
500	We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.
3955	This research paper explores the reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states. By analyzing the behavior of these values in different systems, it was discovered that their values are not always what one would expect based on classical physics. Specifically, it was found that the expectation values of linear momentum can be zero even when the particle is in motion, and the expectation values of angular momentum can be non-zero even when the system has no net angular momentum. These findings highlight the limitations of classical physics in predicting the behavior of quantum systems and have important implications for understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.
3231	The compact form of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian is a reformulation of its original form and is expressed in terms of chiral rotated electroweak gauge fields, which is crucial for relating the information of underlying theories to the coefficients of the low-energy effective Lagrangian. However the compact form obtained in previous works is not complete. In this letter we add several new chiral invariant terms to it and discuss the contributions of these terms to the original electroweak chiral Lagrangian.
2590	We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory. For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.
1320	This research paper explores the microscopic mechanism behind cold denaturation, the phenomenon where proteins lose their native structure and stability at low temperatures. Using computer simulations and theoretical models, the authors demonstrate that cold denaturation is caused by a decrease in protein solvation due to the formation of ice-like water structures around the protein. They also propose a new model for predicting the temperature at which cold denaturation occurs based on protein size and shape. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the physical principles that govern protein stability, which could have implications for fields such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
3093	This research paper investigates the non-extensive thermodynamics of 1D systems with long-range interaction. The main objective is to explore the behavior of such systems under non-extensive statistical mechanics, which has been shown to be more appropriate for systems with long-range interactions. The paper presents a theoretical framework for calculating the thermodynamic quantities of these systems, including the entropy and energy. The results indicate that the non-extensive formalism leads to a better description of the thermodynamic behavior of 1D systems with long-range interaction. Additionally, the study reveals that the parameter q, which characterizes the non-extensive statistical mechanics, plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system. Overall, the findings suggest that non-extensive thermodynamics is a promising approach for understanding the properties of complex systems with long-range interactions.
3202	This research paper explores the use of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (KCC) as a measure of randomness in short sequences. The KCC measures the minimum amount of information needed to generate a sequence, and has been used extensively in the study of algorithmic randomness. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the KCC for short sequences, showing that it can be an effective measure of randomness even for sequences of only a few bits. The authors also discuss the limitations of the KCC for short sequences, and propose several modifications to improve its accuracy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the study of randomness and complexity in computational systems.
2096	Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show variability. The design of an efficient field emitting device requires the analysis of the variabilities with a systematic and multiphysics based modeling approach. In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to study the performance at the device scale.
915	This research paper examines the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) through surveys conducted by the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project, from the Burst Alert Telescope Swift Survey (BATSS) to the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST). The study investigates the temporal behavior of AGN in different energy bands and spatial distributions. The research employs a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the light curves and identify AGN candidates. The results reveal a significant increase in the number of AGN detected by DASCH from BATSS to EXIST, indicating the potential for future surveys to uncover new insights into AGN variability and evolution. These findings have implications for understanding the physics of AGN and their role in the broader astrophysical context.
2985	The paper investigates the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies in the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory. MOND is an alternative to dark matter that proposes a modification to gravity on galactic scales. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the vertical structure of disk galaxies in MOND. The results show that the vertical velocity dispersion of stars increases with radius, which is consistent with observations. The study also finds that MOND produces more pronounced flaring of the disk than the classical Newtonian dynamics. The authors conclude that MOND provides a good description of the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies and is a viable alternative to dark matter.
2395	This research paper explores the dynamics of quintessence, a hypothetical form of dark energy that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The authors investigate the behavior of quintessence in various cosmological models and analyze its impact on the evolution of the universe. They find that quintessence can have a significant effect on the cosmic history and can potentially provide an explanation for the observed acceleration. The study also highlights the importance of considering both the dynamics and the properties of quintessence in order to better understand its role in the universe. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its impact on the evolution of the cosmos.
2792	This research paper presents the study of nucleosome remodeling and sliding by the SWI/SNF complex using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The primary focus of the study is to map the dynamic changes in nucleosome structure and positioning during SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. The study highlights the critical role of the SWI/SNF complex in regulating gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape. The key discoveries of this study include the identification of distinct remodeling intermediates and the demonstration of the processivity of SWI/SNF-mediated sliding. The study concludes that AFM imaging provides a valuable tool for investigating the dynamic structural changes induced by chromatin remodeling factors.
985	"The research paper titled ""Lifetime Improvement in Wireless Sensor Networks via Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission"" investigates the use of collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission for improving the lifetime of wireless sensor networks.

The study concludes that collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission can be effective techniques for improving the performance of wireless sensor networks."
172	This research paper investigates the atmospheric dynamics and mass loss process in red supergiant stars. Using numerical simulations, we explore how the complex interplay between convection, pulsation, and radiation drives the formation of extended atmospheres and outflows. Our results suggest that the mass loss rates in red supergiants are highly dependent on the strength and distribution of convective motions, as well as the properties of the radiation field. We also find that the geometry and kinematics of the outflows can vary significantly depending on the underlying atmospheric structure. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution and the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements.
773	We report on far infrared measurements of interplane conductivity for underdoped single-crystal YBa2Cu3Oy in magnetic field and situate these new data within earlier work on two other high-Tc cuprate superconductors, La(2-x)SrxCuO4 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d). The three systems have displayed apparently disparate electrodynamic responses in the Josephson vortex state formed when magnetic field H is applied parallel to the CuO2 planes. Specifically, there is discrepancy in the number and field dependence of longitudinal modes observed. We compare and contrast these findings with several models of the electrodynamics in the vortex state and suggest that most differences can be reconciled through considerations of the Josephson vortex lattice ground state as well as the c-axis and in-plane quasiparticle dissipations.
1299	We investigate the effects of a nearly uniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on the properties of immersed trapped impurity atoms. Using a weak-coupling expansion in the BEC-impurity interaction strength, we derive a model describing polarons, i.e., impurities dressed by a coherent state of Bogoliubov phonons, and apply it to ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We show that, with increasing BEC temperature, the transport properties of the impurities change from coherent to diffusive. Furthermore, stable polaron clusters are formed via a phonon-mediated off-site attraction.
2683	The Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal exhibits a complex structural arrangement, which can be characterized by the formation of Xi-approximants and metadislocations. In this research paper, we present a unified projection formalism to describe the structural features of the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal and its related approximants. The formalism is based on the projection of higher-dimensional quasicrystals onto lower-dimensional lattices. Through this method, we analyze the formation of Xi-approximants and their metadislocations, which play a crucial role in the stability and mechanical properties of the material. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural properties of the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal and its related approximants, which can be further utilized in the design and development of new materials with improved properties.
2606	"The research paper titled ""The Reverse Shock of SNR 1987A"" focuses on the study of the reverse shock wave generated by the supernova explosion of SNR 1987A. The paper outlines the observations and analysis of the X-ray and radio emissions from the supernova remnant over a period of 30 years since its explosion. The study provides important insights into the physical properties of the reverse shock wave and its interaction with the surrounding medium. The research concludes that the reverse shock wave has a significant impact on the evolution of supernova remnants and the distribution of cosmic ray particles in the interstellar medium."
303	This research paper investigates the dynamics of accretion disks using mean-field magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) techniques. We present a theoretical framework that combines the effects of magnetic fields and fluid dynamics in accretion disks. Our analysis shows that the magnetic field can significantly affect the disk's accretion rate and the formation of structures such as jets and outflows. We explore the behavior of the MHD equations under different physical conditions and study the role of turbulence in the disk's evolution. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms that drive accretion in astrophysical systems and offer a new perspective on the formation and evolution of accretion disks.

The theoretical framework of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory is used to analyze the time evolution of the nuclear system during the fusion process. Results obtained from this study provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the fusion process and can contribute to the development of more accurate models for predicting fusion cross-sections in nuclear reactions.
2214	As the likely birthplaces of planets and an essential conduit for the buildup of stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in star and planet formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest because of their ability to probe the dynamics, physical and chemical structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such studies to, e.g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks. Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the physical processes governing star and planet formation.
3018	This research paper focuses on the high energy variability of synchrotron-self Compton emitting sources and proposes that one zone models are insufficient to explain the observed variability. Through a thorough analysis of the data, the authors demonstrate that the variability is likely due to multiple emitting regions rather than a single zone. They propose a new model that incorporates multiple emitting regions and discuss the implications of this model for future research in this area. The critical outcome of this research is that a more accurate understanding of high energy variability in synchrotron-self Compton emitting sources will require more complex models that account for multiple emitting regions.
1430	This research paper discusses the use of effective field theory (EFT) in the context of extra dimensions and renormalizability. The authors demonstrate that EFT can be employed to study the effects of extra dimensions on low-energy physics and to investigate the renormalizability of such theories. They also demonstrate that the use of EFT leads to the discovery of new phenomena, such as the appearance of non-renormalizable operators and the need for additional counterterms. The authors conclude that EFT provides a powerful tool for studying theories with extra dimensions and for understanding the role of renormalizability in such theories.
3727	"Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity."
2298	The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the supersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a vortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex formation.
2101	"The research paper ""Effects of accelerating growth on the evolution of weighted complex networks"" explores the impact of accelerated growth on the evolution of weighted complex networks. The paper presents a model where new nodes are added to the network with varying probabilities, depending on their degree and the overall growth rate. The simulation results show that the accelerated growth leads to a more uneven distribution of weights and a higher degree of heterogeneity in the network. The study also highlights that the rate of growth significantly influences the network's structure and dynamics, affecting its resilience and vulnerability to perturbations. The research concludes that the understanding of the effects of growth on complex networks is crucial for predicting and managing the behavior of real-world systems, such as the internet or social networks."
891	This research paper explores the matter-wave interference in s-wave and p-wave Fermi condensates. The study aims to investigate the impact of the interaction between the two types of condensates on the interference pattern. The research involved performing experiments and numerical simulations to observe the interference pattern and analyze the results. The critical outcome of the study is that the interference pattern in p-wave Fermi condensates is significantly different from that in s-wave Fermi condensates due to the presence of a nodal plane. The study concludes that the matter-wave interference in Fermi condensates can provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum systems and can be applied in the development of new quantum technologies.
453	Suppose that a target function is monotonic, namely, weakly increasing, and an original estimate of the target function is available, which is not weakly increasing. Many common estimation methods used in statistics produce such estimates. We show that these estimates can always be improved with no harm using rearrangement techniques: The rearrangement methods, univariate and multivariate, transform the original estimate to a monotonic estimate, and the resulting estimate is closer to the true curve in common metrics than the original estimate. We illustrate the results with a computational example and an empirical example dealing with age-height growth charts.
701	It has been recently demonstrated that the orbital velocity profile around Kerr black holes in the equatorial plane as observed in the locally non-rotating frame exhibits a non-monotonic radial behaviour. We show here that this unexpected minimum-maximum feature of the orbital velocity remains if the Kerr vacuum is generalized to the Kerr-de Sitter or Kerr-anti-de Sitter metric. This is a new general relativity effect in Kerr spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant. Assuming that the profile of the orbital velocity is known, this effect constrains the spacetime parameters.
1436	Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.
1146	We describe the hardwired implementation of algorithms for Monte Carlo simulations of a large class of spin models. We have implemented these algorithms as VHDL codes and we have mapped them onto a dedicated processor based on a large FPGA device. The measured performance on one such processor is comparable to O(100) carefully programmed high-end PCs: it turns out to be even better for some selected spin models. We describe here codes that we are currently executing on the IANUS massively parallel FPGA-based system.
1132	This research paper aims to investigate the centrality dependence of elliptic flow, the hydrodynamic limit, and the viscosity of hot QCD. The study focuses on analyzing the behavior of the elliptic flow and its dependence on the collision centrality, which is related to the hydrodynamic limit and viscosity of hot QCD. The research utilizes a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between these variables. The findings of this study are essential in advancing our knowledge of the fundamental properties of hot QCD and can contribute to enhancing our understanding of the behavior of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.
3237	We investigate, in the context of five-dimensional (5D) Brans-Dicke theory of gravity, the idea that macroscopic matter configurations can be generated from pure vacuum in five dimensions, an approach first proposed in the framework of general relativity. We show that the 5D Brans-Dicke vacuum equations when reduced to four dimensions lead to a modified version of Brans-Dicke theory in four dimensions (4D). As an application of the formalism, we obtain two five-dimensional extensions of four-dimensional O'Hanlon and Tupper vacuum solution and show that they lead two different cosmological scenarios in 4D.
1913	The research paper explores the possibility of dark energy arising from modified F(R)-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The primary focus is to investigate the impact of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the evolution of the universe and the behavior of dark energy. The paper concludes that the inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet term leads to a more accurate description of the universe's expansion and provides a natural mechanism for the existence of dark energy. This finding offers new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe and its evolution over time.
3413	This research paper proposes a Bayesian approach to Neuro-Rough models for effective classification and prediction in complex datasets. Neuro-Rough models combine the power of neural networks and rough sets to handle uncertainties and inconsistencies in data. However, selecting appropriate parameters and optimizing the model's performance remains a challenge. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides a probabilistic framework for model training, selection, and evaluation, offering a principled approach to address these issues. Our proposed Bayesian Neuro-Rough model shows promising results on benchmark datasets and demonstrates the potential to improve classification accuracy and interpretability in various applications.
593	This research paper focuses on the interlacing product and triangular action of Lie algebras. The study presents a new interpretation of the triangular action of Lie algebras and establishes a connection between the interlacing product and the triangular action. The research concludes that the interlacing product can be expressed in terms of the triangular action and provides a new tool for studying Lie algebras. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the interplay between Lie algebras and their actions.
2199	This research paper examines the charges and near-horizon data of black rings, a class of black holes with non-spherical horizons. We provide comments on recent developments in the study of black rings, including various models for the black ring geometry and the use of holography to understand their properties. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the charges and near-horizon data of black rings for the AdS/CFT correspondence and other areas of theoretical physics. Our analysis suggests that black rings may provide important insights into the nature of gravity and the structure of spacetime.
191	PArthENoPE is a publicly available algorithm that evaluates the nucleosynthesis of primordial elements in the early universe. This research paper outlines the development and implementation of the algorithm and presents its results in comparison to observational data. The algorithm's ability to accurately predict the abundance of primordial elements, such as helium, deuterium, and lithium, provides important insights into the conditions and processes that existed in the early universe. The findings of this research have implications for our understanding of the evolution and structure of the cosmos.
3675	This research paper presents a novel approach for the intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources. The proposed method is based on a combination of time difference of arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques, which enables the estimation of the location of multiple sources in real time. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations and experiments, which show that it can accurately locate multiple sources with high precision and low error. The results suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to enhance the performance of acoustic emission monitoring systems in various applications, such as structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. Part II of this research paper will further extend the proposed method to handle more complex scenarios, such as sources with different amplitudes and frequencies, and to investigate its robustness under different noise conditions.
2927	We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities, timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
314	The research paper explores the problem of navigation on complex networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. The authors investigate various methods for mixing different types of navigation strategies, including random walks and personalized PageRank algorithms, to optimize efficiency and accuracy in reaching desired nodes on the network. The study concludes that a combination of these strategies can provide significant improvements in navigation performance, particularly in large and densely connected networks. The findings have implications for a wide range of applications, from search engines and social networks to transportation systems and disease control.
112	This research paper explores the properties of geodesics on an ellipsoid in Minkowski space. The study investigates the behavior of geodesics on an ellipsoid and discusses the differences between geodesics on an ellipsoid and those on a sphere. The paper also examines the relationship between the curvature of the ellipsoid and the geodesics that exist on it. The research findings highlight the importance of understanding the behavior of geodesics on an ellipsoid, which has significant implications in various fields of physics, including relativity and cosmology.

1558	This research paper investigates the spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations of the brightest cluster and group galaxies. The main objective is to understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies in the context of their surrounding environments. The study utilizes integral field spectroscopy and imaging data from the MaNGA survey to analyze the kinematics and stellar populations of these galaxies. The key findings include the identification of two distinct populations of brightest cluster galaxies with different kinematic properties and stellar populations. Additionally, the study finds evidence for recent star formation in some of the brightest group galaxies, suggesting that these galaxies are still actively evolving. Overall, the research highlights the importance of considering the environment when studying the formation and evolution of brightest cluster and group galaxies.
2896	I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.
2986	We investigate a pair entanglement of electrons in diatomic molecule, modeled as a correlated double quantum dot attached to the leads. The low-temperature properties are derived from the ground state obtained by utilizing the Rejec-Ramsak variational technique within the framework of EDABI method, which combines exact diagonalization with ab initio calculations. The results show, that single-particle basis renormalization modifies the entanglement-switch effectiveness significantly. We also found the entanglement signature of a competition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases.
2164	We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions, that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells, are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar
1840	This research paper presents a study on the thermodynamic properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) superconductor, which is highly desirable for various technological applications. The electronic dispersion of BSCCO was calculated using a first-principles approach to obtain the band structure. Based on the electronic dispersion, various thermodynamic properties were calculated, including the specific heat, entropy, and free energy. The results show that the specific heat and entropy of BSCCO are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, the calculated free energy provides valuable information on the stability of the superconducting state. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of BSCCO and enhance the potential for its use in various technological applications.
D2-52	Mainstream physicists treat “quarks” and “gluons” as real particles. However, the observational evidence disagrees with that conclusion. Whereas electron and protons exist for billions of years, “quarks” are only observed for less than billionths of a second. Gluons are not observed at all, but are only theorized. When “quarks” are “observed,” it is during a collision among protons and/or neutrons in an accelerator. After the collision, the “quarks” completely disappear and are never observed again. There has never been an observation of a “sea of quarks” among from which could be used to construct new protons or neutrons. “Quarks” are nothing more than debris from a collision; much like glass shards are debris from a glass striking a brick wall.
1471	The research paper presents a new memory network architecture that balances the trade-off between the ability to store and retrieve information in long-term memory and the capacity to learn new associations in short-term memory. The proposed model, called Balanced Memory Network (BMN), is tested on several benchmark datasets and outperforms existing memory network models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The findings suggest that the BMN can provide a robust and scalable solution for memory-based learning tasks.
2964	The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure.
616	Magnetic domain patterns under an oscillating field is studied theoretically by using a simple Ising-like model. We propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field. The first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out, and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns. The second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field, and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field.
140	This research paper explores the Langevin dynamics of the pure SU(2) deconfining transition. The pure SU(2) gauge theory is known to undergo a phase transition from a confined phase to a deconfined phase at a critical temperature. The Langevin dynamics approach is used to study the transition as it provides a powerful tool for simulating the dynamics of complex systems. The study investigates the behavior of the order parameter, which is used to characterize the transition, and shows that it exhibits critical scaling behavior near the transition point. The results obtained from the simulations are compared to theoretical predictions and experimental data to validate the approach. The study concludes by discussing the significance of the findings in advancing our understanding of the pure SU(2) deconfining transition and its potential applications in related fields.
2753	Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of (relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
837	"The research paper titled ""Multiple pattern matching: A Markov chain approach"" proposes a novel method for efficiently identifying multiple patterns in a given sequence. The approach utilizes a Markov chain framework to model the underlying patterns and their relationships in the sequence. The proposed method was compared with existing approaches and was found to be more efficient in terms of computational time and memory usage. The authors conclude that the Markov chain approach offers a promising solution for multiple pattern matching in various applications such as bioinformatics and natural language processing."
957	This research paper presents a new class of pairwise-independent joinings, which are structures that arise in probability theory and have applications in various fields, such as computer science and physics. The paper introduces a method for constructing such joinings and establishes several key properties of this class, including its relationship to other known classes of joinings. Notably, the paper proves that under certain conditions, this new class of joinings is equivalent to the class of independent joinings, which has important implications for studying probabilistic systems. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of pairwise-independent joinings and their role in probability theory.
1187	"The research paper ""Astrophysical Accretion as an Analogue Gravity Phenomena"" explores the analogies between astrophysical accretion and gravity phenomena, and how these analogies can be used to gain insights into the behavior of black holes and other gravity systems. The paper examines the similarities between astrophysical accretion disks and the dynamics of fluids in curved spacetime, and shows how the study of these analogies can help us understand the behavior of accretion disks and other gravity systems. The authors conclude that the study of astrophysical accretion as an analogue gravity phenomenon has the potential to provide new insights into the fundamental nature of gravity and its role in the universe."
1870	We look for wide, faint companions around members of the 5 Myr Lambda Orionis open cluster. We used optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. We report the discovery of a very wide very low mass visual binary, LOri167, formed by a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass candidate located at 5 arcsec, which seems to belong to the cluster. We derive Teff of 2125 and 1750 K. If they are members, comparisons with theoretical models indicate masses of 17 (20-15) Mjup and 8 (13-7) Mjup, with a projected separation of 2000 AU. Such a binary system would be difficult to explain in most models, particularly those where substellar objects form in the disks surrounding higher mass stars.
3593	The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a crucial tool for understanding the origins and evolution of the universe. Recent studies have shown that the CMB can also provide valuable information about the outer solar system. This research paper explores how the CMB can reveal the properties of distant objects such as Kuiper Belt Objects and the Oort Cloud. We examine the ways in which the CMB can be used to study the composition, size, and shape of these bodies. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the outer solar system. Our analysis suggests that the CMB is a powerful tool for investigating the outer reaches of our solar system and can provide valuable insights into the history of our cosmic neighborhood.
1611	This research paper investigates the justification of the coupled-mode approximation for a nonlinear elliptic problem with a periodic potential. The coupled-mode approximation is a commonly used method for approximating solutions to nonlinear problems in physics and engineering. However, its validity for nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and theoretical analysis to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the coupled-mode approximation in this particular context. Our results show that the coupled-mode approximation is a reliable method for approximating solutions to nonlinear elliptic problems with periodic potentials, and can be used in a wide range of applications in physics and engineering.
421	We consider controllability of two conjugate observables Z and X by two parties with classical communication. The ability is specified by two alternative tasks, (i) agreement on Z and (ii) preparation of an eigenstate of X with use of an extra communication channel. We prove that their feasibility is equivalent to that of key distillation if the extra channel is quantum, and to that of entanglement distillation if it is classical. This clarifies the distinction between two entanglement measures, distillable key and distillable entanglement.
D2-73	"Lamarck's ""Hydrogéologie"" (1802) represents a fascinating but often overlooked contribution to early geological thought. While Lamarck is primarily remembered for his evolutionary biology theories, this work showcases his broader scientific vision. In it, he proposed that Earth's features formed through gradual processes over immense time periods—challenging the catastrophist views popular in his era. The text emphasized water's crucial role in shaping landscapes and theorized about atmospheric influences on geological formations. Notably, Lamarck's uniformitarian approach in geology paralleled his biological thinking about gradual change. Though overshadowed by his biological works and contemporaries like Cuvier, ""Hydrogéologie"" demonstrates Lamarck's cross-disciplinary thinking and his willingness to challenge scientific orthodoxy across multiple fields."
789	We study the motion of small particles in a random turbulent flow assuming linear law of friction. We derive a symmetry relation obeyed by the large deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponents in the phase space. The relation applies when either the statistics of the strain matrix is invariant under the transposition or when it is time-reversible. We show that, as a result, the Lyapunov exponents come in pairs which sum is equal to minus the inverse relaxation time of the particles. We use the pairing to consider the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the particles attractor in the phase space. In particular, the results apply to case of the flow which is white noise in time.
2788	This research paper investigates the pseudogap and charge density waves in two-dimensional systems. The main objective of this study is to understand the properties of these phenomena in various materials and their effects on electronic behavior. The paper discusses the key findings of the research, including the discovery of the interplay between pseudogap and charge density waves, the identification of the symmetry breaking of the charge density waves, and the observation of the temperature and doping dependence of the pseudogap. The paper concludes that the understanding of these phenomena is crucial for understanding the behavior of materials at low temperatures and can have important implications for the development of new technologies.
2068	This research paper investigates the temperature dependence of the electronic properties of a quasi-one-dimensional quarter-filled band system. The transition from the Wigner crystal phase to the Bond-Charge-Density wave phase is studied as a function of temperature using numerical simulations. The results suggest that the transition occurs at a critical temperature, which decreases with increasing system size. The paper provides insights into the underlying physics of the phase transition and its dependence on temperature and system size, which may have implications for the design of novel materials with tailored electronic properties.
1905	This research paper presents a novel approach to designing algebraic distributed space-time codes with low maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. The proposed codes are constructed using algebraic techniques that allow for efficient encoding and decoding, as well as low complexity ML decoding. The codes are designed for distributed antenna systems, where multiple antennas are distributed across different nodes in a network. The proposed codes are shown to achieve high data rates while maintaining low decoding complexity, making them ideal for practical applications. The performance of the proposed codes is evaluated using simulations in various network scenarios, and the results demonstrate that they outperform existing state-of-the-art codes in terms of both performance and complexity. The proposed codes provide a promising solution for high-speed and low-latency communication in distributed antenna systems.
2333	The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.
1723	This research paper investigates the sensitivity of low degree oscillations to changes in solar abundances. The study uses data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to analyze variations in the frequencies of solar oscillations caused by changes in the abundances of different chemical elements. The results reveal that low degree oscillations are highly sensitive to changes in solar abundances, especially for elements such as helium and oxygen. The study also suggests that these oscillations could be used to infer changes in the composition of the solar interior. Overall, the findings of this research paper have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Sun, and could contribute to the development of more accurate models of solar behavior.
705	Using the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and the (non self-consistent) GW approach, the (quasi-particle) band structure is calculated for MnTe in zinc-blende geometry. Different parameters characterizing the electronic structure are computed for an antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase and compared with the experiment. The strong Hubbard-type repulsion on the Mn-3d orbitals and the p-d hybridization are seen to be responsible for substantial defects found in the LSDA picture. It is discussed to which extent these can be improved upon by means of the GW approach.
2748	"Kinetically constrained spin models are known to exhibit dynamical behavior mimicking that of glass forming systems. They are often understood as coarse-grained models of glass formers, in terms of some ""mobility"" field. The identity of this ""mobility"" field has remained elusive due to the lack of coarse-graining procedures to obtain these models from a more microscopic point of view. Here we exhibit a scheme to map the dynamics of a two-dimensional soft disc glass former onto a kinetically constrained spin model, providing an attempt at bridging these two approaches."
1413	The formation of ultracold molecules via stimulated emission followed by a radiative deexcitation cascade in the presence of a static electric field is investigated. By analyzing the corresponding cross sections, we demonstrate the possibility to populate the lowest rotational excitations via photoassociation. The modification of the radiative cascade due to the electric field leads to narrow rotational state distributions in the vibrational ground state. External fields might therefore represent an additional valuable tool towards the ultimate goal of quantum state preparation of molecules.
810	This research paper investigates the ionization fraction of the Barnard 68 molecular cloud and its potential implications for star and planet formation. Through observations of spectral lines, the ionization fraction of the cloud is estimated, and its impact on the formation of protostars and planets is explored. The results suggest that the ionization fraction plays a crucial role in the formation of these celestial bodies and may have significant implications for our understanding of the early stages of star and planet formation. The findings of this study have important implications for future research in astrophysics and planetary science.
1625	This research paper investigates the interaction between a high-intensity photon beam and a plasma, with a focus on its possible role in gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission mechanisms. The study uses a relativistic approach to model the interaction and examines the resulting dynamics and radiation emission. The research finds that the photon beam can generate a strong electric field in the plasma, leading to the acceleration of electrons and the production of high-energy photons. These processes can potentially explain some of the observed properties of GRBs, such as their high energy and short duration. The study highlights the importance of considering plasma effects in understanding the physics of GRBs.
3823	Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively.
1542	In this paper we suggest a theoretical method based on the statistical mechanics for treating the alpha-helix-random coil transition in alanine polypeptides. We consider this process as a first-order phase transition and develop a theory which is free of model parameters and is based solely on fundamental physical principles. It describes essential thermodynamical properties of the system such as heat capacity, the phase transition temperature and others from the analysis of the polypeptide potential energy surface calculated as a function of two dihedral angles, responsible for the polypeptide twisting. The suggested theory is general and with some modification can be applied for the description of phase transitions in other complex molecular systems (e.g. proteins, DNA, nanotubes, atomic clusters, fullerenes).
1660	The paper explores the connection between Lie theory, deformation theory, and quantization. It shows that deformation theory provides a natural way to construct quantum groups from Lie algebras, and that this approach can be extended to noncommutative geometry. The paper also discusses the relationship between deformation quantization and the quantization of Poisson manifolds, and how these ideas can be applied to the study of geometric quantization. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between Lie theory, deformation theory, and quantization, and highlights the importance of these concepts in modern mathematical physics.
2592	A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points (EPs). The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are Puiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the apparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions with finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary normalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance to EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of PT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture concerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.
215	The paper investigates the distribution of entropy production for a colloidal particle in a nonequilibrium steady state. The authors use a stochastic thermodynamics approach to model the system and derive the probability density function of entropy production. They find that the distribution of entropy production is non-Gaussian and can be described by a power law. Additionally, they show that the mean entropy production is proportional to the applied force, providing insight into the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states. Overall, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems and may have important implications for the design of nanoscale devices.
932	"The research paper titled ""Reaction rate calculation by parallel path swapping"" focuses on a new approach to calculate reaction rates in complex chemical systems. The authors propose using a parallel path swapping algorithm that can efficiently handle large systems and multiple reaction pathways. The method involves swapping parallel reaction pathways to calculate the rate of each reaction. The authors tested the algorithm on several complex chemical systems, including a catalytic cracking reaction and a combustion reaction. The results show that the parallel path swapping algorithm is an accurate and efficient method for calculating reaction rates. The authors conclude that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the understanding of complex chemical systems and aid in the design of new catalysts and processes."
868	A singular foliation on a complete riemannian manifold M is said to be riemannian if each geodesic that is perpendicular at one point to a leaf remains perpendicular to every leaf it meets. We prove that the regular leaves are equifocal, i.e., the end point map of a normal foliated vector field has constant rank. This implies that we can reconstruct the singular foliation by taking all parallel submanifolds of a regular leaf with trivial holonomy. In addition, the end point map of a normal foliated vector field on a leaf with trivial holonomy is a covering map. These results generalize previous results of the authors on singular riemannian foliations with sections.
889	This research paper investigates the effectiveness of two types of symplectic integrators, forward and non-forward, in solving classical dynamics problems. The study finds that both types of integrators have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific problem being solved. However, non-forward integrators generally provide more accurate results for long-term simulations. The research suggests that the choice of integrator should be carefully considered based on the problem at hand to achieve the most accurate and efficient results.
2017	The research paper explores the implications of thermal weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as the dark matter candidate in the early universe. The authors find that if WIMPs were responsible for the observed dark matter, their interactions with the primordial plasma would have affected the early universe's thermal history. By studying the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, the authors place constraints on the properties of WIMPs and their interactions with the primordial plasma, ruling out certain parameter space. The study provides valuable insights into the nature of dark matter and the early universe and has implications for future dark matter detection experiments.

The paper presents the design and construction of the modular LArTPC, as well as its performance in detecting neutrino events. The outcomes of the project are promising, demonstrating the feasibility of using modular LArTPCs for neutrino detection and the potential for achieving high sensitivity to low energy neutrinos. The conclusions of the paper highlight the importance of continued research in this field to further advance our knowledge of neutrinos and their role in the universe.
3884	"The research paper titled ""The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations"" explores the formation and evolution of binary stars in star clusters. The authors used computer simulations to create realistic models of star clusters, and analyzed the binary fractions in the core regions of these clusters. They found that the binary fraction in the core region depends on the initial conditions of the cluster, with denser clusters having higher binary fractions. They also found that binary stars in the core region tend to be more massive than those in the outer regions. The authors conclude that binary stars are an important factor in the dynamical evolution of star clusters, and that understanding their formation and evolution is crucial for understanding the properties of star clusters."
667	A hybrid ferromagnet/semiconductor device is used to determine a lower bound on the spin lifetime for conduction electrons in silicon. We use spin precession to self-consistently measure the drift velocity vs. drift field of spin-polarized electrons and use this electronic control to change the transit time between electron injection and detection. A measurement of normalized magnetocurrent as a function of drift velocity is used with a simple exponential-decay model to argue that the lifetime obtained (~2 ns) is artificially lowered by electronic effects and is likely orders of magnitude higher.
3234	This research paper presents a novel approach for designing rate-compatible low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that can be efficiently encoded. The proposed method utilizes the concept of puncturing and shortening to achieve rate compatibility. The main contribution of the paper is the development of an efficient algorithm for generating rate-compatible LDPC codes with good performance. The proposed codes are evaluated through simulations, and the results demonstrate that they achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art rate-compatible LDPC codes. The proposed methodology can be used for the design of efficient and flexible communication systems that can adapt to different channel conditions and data rates. Overall, the findings of this research provide insights into the development of rate-compatible LDPC codes that can be efficiently implemented in practical applications.
2828	This research paper focuses on the optimal routing for decode-and-forward (DF) based cooperation in wireless networks. The main objective is to determine the best routing strategy that can effectively enhance the overall network performance. The study proposes a novel cooperative routing algorithm that considers the trade-off between the transmission distance and the number of hops. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional routing methods in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency. The paper concludes that the optimal routing strategy can significantly improve the performance of DF-based cooperative wireless networks.
3650	This research paper aims to introduce and analyze the concept of stochastic Lie group integrators, which are numerical methods used to solve stochastic differential equations on Lie groups. The paper will first provide a brief overview of Lie groups and their relevance in physics and mathematics, followed by a discussion of stochastic differential equations and their applications.

The results of this study have implications for a wide range of fields, including physics, engineering, and finance.
445	Spherically symmetric transonic accretion of a fractal medium has been studied in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary transonic solution is greatly sensitive to infinitesimal deviations in the outer boundary condition, but the flow becomes transonic and stable, when its evolution is followed through time. The evolution towards transonicity is more pronounced for a fractal medium than what is it for a continuum. The dynamic approach also shows that there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of motion for a perturbation in the flow, and the metric of an analogue acoustic black hole. The stationary inflow solutions of a fractal medium are as much stable under the influence of linearised perturbations, as they are for the fluid continuum.
542	This research paper explores the possibility of emergent gravity from direct-action electromagnetic interactions within a toy universe of electrons and positrons. By studying the behavior of these particles within a confined system, the researchers aim to understand how gravity may manifest itself without the need for a gravitational force. Using simulations and theoretical modeling, the team investigates the potential for emergent gravity in this system and discusses its implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. The results suggest that emergent gravity may be a viable explanation for the observed gravitational phenomena and offer new insights into the nature of the universe.
D2-9	There are two types of diabetes: type 1, where your body is unable to make insulin; and type 2, where your body is unable to properly use the insulin it makes. When your body doesn't have enough insulin, you can't move glucose from your blood to the cells, and then you don't get the nutrients your body needs for energy. Type 2 diabetes is also often genetic, as in my case. The fact that there's no break from the disease. I have diabetes 24/7, 365 days a year. Managing what I eat is a constant challenge, especially when there are potato chips nearby. And honestly, I hate cooking and I'm always looking for easy recipes.
2385	This research paper investigates the sensitivity of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy is a novel technique that combines the benefits of differential stereoscopy and spectral imaging to produce high-quality images with enhanced sensitivity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique by comparing it to other existing spectral imaging methods. The experimental results show that hybrid differential stereoscopy is highly sensitive and outperforms other methods in terms of image quality and spectral resolution. Therefore, it has great potential in various applications such as biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial inspection. This research provides valuable insights into the development of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging and its future applications.
749	Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD, such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent. While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust for hundreds of qubits.
561	This research paper focuses on developing a model to predict the Epps effect, which is the tendency of cross-correlations between asset prices to increase during periods of high volatility. The paper proposes a new approach to modeling this effect, which takes into account both the level of volatility and the time lag between observations. The results of the study demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in predicting the Epps effect. The findings have important implications for risk management and portfolio optimization in the finance industry.
1813	This research paper explores the possibility of using very short gamma-ray bursts (VSGRBs) to detect primordial black holes (PBHs) in the universe. The study examines the characteristics of VSGRBs and their potential connection to PBHs, which are believed to have formed in the early universe. The results suggest that VSGRBs may indeed be a viable tool for detecting PBHs, as they exhibit unique features that distinguish them from other types of gamma-ray bursts. The study concludes that further investigation into this area could provide valuable insights into the nature and distribution of PBHs in the universe.
2237	In this research paper, we investigate the band structure of a polaron system using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) after photodissociation of Landau-Pekar polarons. Our central focus is to understand the effect of the dissociation process on the electronic structure of the system. Our key findings reveal the emergence of a clear band in the ARPES spectra after photodissociation, which we attribute to the formation of a delocalized state due to the fragmentation of the polaron. Our conclusions suggest that the photodissociation of polarons can serve as a useful tool to explore the electronic properties of polaron systems and provide insights into the nature of their excitations.
3111	The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT observations of gamma-ray binaries.
1066	"The research paper titled ""Radiative Properties of a Linear Chain of Coupled Qubits"" explores the behavior of a collection of coupled qubits when subjected to external radiation. The paper focuses on the radiative properties of the qubits, including their emission and absorption rates, as well as the coherence of the emitted radiation. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of a linear chain of identical qubits, with the results indicating that the radiative properties of the chain are strongly dependent on the coupling strength between the qubits. The paper concludes that the coherence of the emitted radiation can be significantly enhanced by controlling the coupling strength between the qubits, which could have important implications for the development of future quantum technologies."
1884	In this paper, we report on the magnetic properties of Ba2CoS3, a spin-chain compound recently found to be the first Co2+ containing one-dimensional sulphide to show metallic-like conductivity and negative magnetoresistance. We carried out an in-depth experimental investigation of the local structure of the cobalt atoms, and ab-initio calculations of the resulting electronic configuration of Co2+. From theoretical considerations, the intra-chain coupling was predicted to be antiferromagnetic. Experimentally, several estimates of this magnetic coupling were derived by analysing the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements also provided evidence of a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering, a feature indicative of a noticeable inter-chain coupling in this quasi-1D system.
3161	This research paper investigates the anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon nanotubes. Through molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that the mode frequencies of tangential modes in carbon nanotubes shift unexpectedly with increasing pressure, contrary to the behavior of other types of modes. The cause of this phenomenon was traced to the lengthening of the carbon-carbon bonds in the nanotube due to pressure, which affects the effective spring constants of the tangential modes. The outcomes of this research provide new insights into the mechanical behavior of single-wall carbon nanotubes and have implications for their potential applications in nanoelectronics and nanomechanics.
2020	We present observations of a solar quiet region obtained by the ground-based Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and by instruments on the spacecraft SOHO and TRACE. The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.
720	This research paper presents a detailed analysis of the Takagi-Taupin description of X-ray dynamical diffraction from diffractive optics with large numerical aperture. The study focuses on the fundamental understanding of the interaction of X-rays with diffractive optics and the resulting diffraction patterns. The paper provides a theoretical framework for modeling the diffraction process and analyzes the effects of various parameters such as the numerical aperture, the thickness of the diffractive optics, and the incident beam profile. The results show that the Takagi-Taupin description provides an accurate and comprehensive solution for the X-ray dynamical diffraction from diffractive optics with large numerical aperture. The paper concludes that this approach can be used to optimize the performance of diffractive optics and improve their applications in X-ray imaging, spectroscopy, and other fields.
3147	This research paper investigates one-dimensional Brownian particle systems with rank-dependent drifts. The authors introduce a general class of models, in which the drift of each particle depends on its current rank within the system. They provide a detailed analysis of the stationary state of the system, derive explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the particle positions, and investigate the behavior of the system in the limit of large particle numbers. The authors show that the rank-dependent drifts can lead to interesting and non-trivial effects in the system's dynamics, including the emergence of phase transitions and the formation of spatial patterns. These results have important implications for understanding the behavior of many-particle systems in a variety of physical and biological contexts.
1942	We introduce and study the notion of a dual Feynman transform of a modular operad. This generalizes and gives a conceptual explanation of Kontsevich's dual construction producing graph cohomology classes from a contractible differential graded Frobenius algebra. The dual Feynman transform of a modular operad is indeed linear dual to the Feynman transform introduced by Getzler and Kapranov when evaluated on vacuum graphs. In marked contrast to the Feynman transform, the dual notion admits an extremely simple presentation via generators and relations; this leads to an explicit and easy description of its algebras. We discuss a further generalization of the dual Feynman transform whose algebras are not necessarily contractible. This naturally gives rise to a two-colored graph complex analogous to the Boardman-Vogt topological tree complex.
4032	This research paper examines the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency potential. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the behavior of an atom subjected to a time-varying potential. The results show that the geometric phase of the atom is highly sensitive to the shape of the potential. Additionally, the study finds that the geometric phase can be used as a tool to manipulate the spin of the atom. Overall, the research highlights the importance of understanding the geometric phase in quantum systems and its potential applications in quantum information processing.
502	This research paper focuses on the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study Reynolds dilatancy in the bulk of smooth granular flows. The study aims to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the behavior of granular materials, which are ubiquitous in various natural and industrial processes. The results demonstrate that MR imaging can effectively capture the dynamics of granular flow, including the evolution of porosity and velocity fields. The findings also reveal that Reynolds dilatancy plays a significant role in the formation of shear bands and the onset of instability in granular flows. Overall, this study highlights the potential of MR imaging as a powerful tool for investigating the complex behavior of granular materials and advancing our understanding of important physical phenomena.
3551	This research paper investigates the relic abundance of dark matter in Universal Extra Dimension (UED) models with right-handed neutrinos. We examine the impact of the extra dimension on the production and decay of the right-handed neutrinos, which are a crucial component in the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry. Our findings reveal that UED models with right-handed neutrinos can produce the correct dark matter relic abundance, and that the observed baryon asymmetry can be generated through leptogenesis. These results have significant implications for the search for dark matter and the study of the origin of matter in the universe.
2548	This research paper focuses on the fluctuations of partial filling factors in competitive Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) from binary mixtures. The study investigates the impact of varying the particle sizes and concentrations on the competitive adsorption process. The results demonstrate that the fluctuations in partial filling factors are strongly dependent on the concentration and size ratio of particles. The findings suggest that the competitive RSA process is highly sensitive to the size disparity between particles, which can have significant implications for designing materials and controlling adsorption in various industrial applications.
3432	This research paper presents a numerical method for the poloidal-toroidal decomposition of vector fields in a finite cylinder. The decomposition is performed using a discretization scheme that is regularized to ensure stability and accuracy. The accuracy of the method is validated by comparing the results with analytical solutions and benchmark tests. The paper also discusses the limitations of the method and suggests areas for future research. Overall, this study provides a useful tool for the analysis of vector fields in cylindrical geometries, with potential applications in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, and geophysics.
3251	Bivariate linear mixed models are useful when analyzing longitudinal data of two associated markers. In this paper, we present a bivariate linear mixed model including random effects or first-order auto-regressive process and independent measurement error for both markers. Codes and tricks to fit these models using SAS Proc MIXED are provided. Limitations of this program are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown. Despite some limitations, SAS Proc MIXED is a useful tool that may be easily extendable to multivariate response in longitudinal studies.
442	This research paper presents the first measurements of proper motions of thin dust filaments located in the Galactic Center region. Using data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, the authors were able to track the motion of these filaments over a period of 5-7 years. They found that the filaments exhibit significant proper motions, with some moving at speeds of up to 100 km/s. The authors suggest that these motions are likely due to the influence of the central supermassive black hole. Additionally, they observed that the filaments are not stationary, but instead exhibit complex, wavy structures. These findings provide important insights into the dynamics of the Galactic Center region and the role of filaments in shaping it.
2113	"The research paper titled ""A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Logic: Extended Version"" presents a new sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic that is cut-free, meaning that it does not involve the elimination of intermediate formulas. The authors introduce a sequent calculus that is sound and complete, and they show that it has a normal form that is unique up to permutation of the premises. They also prove the cut-elimination theorem for the calculus and provide an algorithm for cut-elimination. Finally, the paper presents a number of examples and applications of the calculus. Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the development of sequent calculi for bi-intuitionistic logic and lays the groundwork for further research in this area."
1886	Superfluid 3He-A shares the properties of spin nematic and chiral orbital ferromagnet. Its order parameter is characterized by two vectors d and l. This doubly anisotropic superfluid, when it is confined in aerogel, represents the most interesting example of a system with continuous symmetry in the presence of random anisotropy disorder. We discuss the Larkin-Imry-Ma state, which is characterized by the short-range orientational order of the vector l, while the long-range orientational order is destroyed by the collective action of the randomly oriented aerogel strings. On the other hand, sufficiently large regular anisotropy produced either by the deformation of the aerogel or by applied superflow suppresses the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect leading to the uniform orientation of the vector l. This interplay of regular and random anisotropy allows us to study many different effects.
2501	The research paper investigates the electron transport properties in nanogranular ferromagnets, which are made up of small magnetic particles. The authors use a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to examine the electronic transport behavior in these materials and observe a strong dependence on the size of the magnetic particles. The findings suggest that the electron transport in nanogranular ferromagnets is highly tunable and could have potential applications in spintronics and magnetic storage devices. The study concludes that the understanding of electron transport in nanogranular ferromagnets could lead to the development of more efficient and effective electronic devices.
53	In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered. For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities. It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy efficiency.
D2-54	Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations the behavior of quark and gluon propagators is studied in the Landau gauge for momenta from the deep Euclidean to the confinement regime. We find that while at short distances quarks and gluons propagate like free particles, over longer distances, of the order of a fermi, the gluon propagator is greatly enhanced as are the triple-gluon and quark-gluon couplings. These in turn suppress the propagation of massless quarks over long distances to such an extent that they have no physical particle pole, exactly as expected of a confining theory. We study the way the world changes as the number of massless flavors of quark is increased from zero.
692	This research paper investigates the magnetohydrostatic properties of solar prominences in near-potential coronal magnetic fields. The study utilizes a three-dimensional MHD model to simulate the equilibrium of the prominence plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. The results show that the prominence plasma is supported by the magnetic field, which controls the pressure balance and the plasma density distribution. The dynamics of the prominence plasma are found to be influenced by the interaction between the magnetic field and the gravity of the Sun. The study also reveals the presence of magnetic dips in the prominence plasma, which are responsible for the formation of filamentary structures. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of solar prominences and the role of magnetic fields in their dynamics.
572	A trapping mechanism is observed and proposed as the origin of the anomalous behavior recently discovered in transport properties of overdamped ratchets subject to external oscillatory drive in the presence of quenched noise. In particular, this mechanism is shown to appear whenever the quenched disorder strength is greater than a threshold value. The minimum disorder strength required for the existence of traps is determined by studying the trap structure in a disorder configuration space. An approximation to the trapping probability density function in a disordered region of finite length included in an otherwise perfect ratchet lattice is obtained. The mean velocity of the particles and the diffusion coefficient are found to have a non-monotonic dependence on the quenched noise strength due to the presence of the traps.
2099	This research paper investigates the molecular environment of massive star forming cores that are associated with Class II methanol maser emission. The study employs observational data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to analyze the physical and chemical properties of these sources. The results suggest that the methanol maser emission is produced in dense and warm gas environments, and is likely linked to the presence of young and massive stars. The study also identifies several molecular tracers that can be used to probe the physical conditions and chemical evolution of these regions. Overall, the findings shed light on the complex processes involved in the formation of massive stars and their surrounding environments.
D2-37	Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a close relationship. The likelihood and severity of type 2 diabetes are closely related to BMI. Obese people have a higher risk of diabetes than healthy weight people, with a threefold increase in risk for overweight people. While it is well known that body fat distribution is an important primary indicator of diabetes risk, the precise mechanism of association is unknown. It is also unknown why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and why not all type 2 diabetics are obese. Also obesity significantly increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in your life. When there is an excess of fat, the tissues must process more nutrients.
1805	We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types, through correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star formation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions, but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.
996	We consider a finite quantum system coupled to quasifree thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Under the assumptions of small coupling and exponential decay of the reservoir correlation function, the large deviation generating function of energy transport into the reservoirs is shown to be analytic on a bounded set. Our method is different from the spectral deformation technique which was employed recently in the study of spin-boson-like models. As a corollary, we derive the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation for the entropy production and a central limit theorem for energy transport.
1846	This research paper focuses on the observations and modeling of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares. The study utilizes high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate the spectral line shapes of flares and to determine the physical properties of the plasma involved. Through the analysis of these observations, the research reveals that the asymmetries in the spectral lines are primarily caused by the Doppler shifts of material moving toward or away from the observer. Furthermore, the paper presents a new flare model that successfully reproduces the line asymmetries observed in the data. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of chromospheric flares and provide a valuable tool for future observations and modeling efforts.
D2-31	Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human health, primarily regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption for bone formation and maintenance. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight, but it can also be obtained through diet (fatty fish, egg yolks) and supplements. The recommended daily intake is 600-800 IU for most adults, though needs increase with age and limited sun exposure. Deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, muscle weakness, and potentially increased risk of certain chronic diseases. Factors affecting vitamin D status include geographical location, season, skin pigmentation, age, and dietary habits. Regular moderate sun exposure combined with dietary sources provides sufficient vitamin D for most people.
858	We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT. The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the Chellas' STIT.
2714	We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of two samples of evolved stars selected in the field and in the intermediate-age open cluster IC 4651, for which detailed measurements of chemical composition were made in the last few years. Applying the Gray's method based on ratios of line depths, we determine the effective temperature and compare our results with previous ones obtained by means of the curves of growth of iron lines. The knowledge of the temperature enables us to estimate other fundamental stellar parameters, such as color excess, age, and mass.
3598	Magneto-optical imaging was used to observe dendritic flux avalanches connecting the outer and inner edges of a ring-shaped superconducting MgB2 film. Such avalanches create heated channels across the entire width of the ring, and inject large amounts of flux into the central hole. By measuring the injected flux and the corresponding reduction of current, which is typically 15%, we estimate the maximum temperature in the channel to be 100 K, and the duration of the process to be on the order of a microsecond. Flux creep simulations reproduce all the observed features in the current density before and after injection events.
3032	Quantum auctions are a novel application of quantum game theory that aim to improve the efficiency and security of traditional auctions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of quantum auctions and present several different protocols that have been proposed in the literature. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each protocol, and compare them to classical auctions in terms of efficiency, fairness, and resistance to fraud and collusion. Our findings suggest that quantum auctions have the potential to revolutionize the auction industry by providing more secure and efficient mechanisms for allocating resources. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this emerging technology and to develop practical implementations that can be used in real-world settings.
4050	The Veldkamp space of two-qubits is a mathematical object that describes the possible geometric arrangements of two qubits in a quantum system. In this paper, we explore the properties of this space and its applications in quantum information theory. We provide a detailed analysis of the structure and geometry of the Veldkamp space, including its symmetries and invariants. We also examine the relationship between the Veldkamp space and other important mathematical objects in quantum information theory, such as the Bloch sphere and the Pauli group. Our results demonstrate the utility of the Veldkamp space in characterizing the entanglement properties of two-qubit systems and in designing quantum error-correcting codes. Overall, our findings have important implications for the development of practical quantum technologies and the understanding of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
722	The Exact Renormalisation Group (ERG) flow has been employed as a powerful tool in many-body physics to study the behavior of ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit. This research paper aims to investigate the ERG flow for ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit and analyze the critical behavior of the system. The study will employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the ERG flow and its implications for ultracold Fermi gases. The results of this investigation will contribute significantly to the current understanding of the physical properties of ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit and provide insights into the critical behavior of these systems.
1940	ULTRACAM is a triple-beam CCD camera designed for high-speed astrophysics. This research paper provides an overview of the design and performance of ULTRACAM, as well as its applications in astrophysics. We demonstrate that ULTRACAM is an ultra-fast camera capable of simultaneously capturing high-resolution images of three different celestial objects at rates up to several hundred frames per second. Our findings show that ULTRACAM is a valuable tool for studying fast-evolving phenomena in astrophysics such as pulsars, binary stars, and supernovae. We conclude that ULTRACAM has the potential to revolutionize high-speed astrophysics research, opening up new avenues for exploration and discovery.
2133	We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits. Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.
2818	This research paper investigated the exchange parameters obtained from an approximate self-interaction correction (ASIC) scheme. The ASIC scheme has been previously shown to improve the accuracy of exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory calculations. The study focused on the analysis of the exchange parameters for atomic systems with varying electron configurations. The main findings of this research paper suggest that the ASIC method significantly improves the accuracy of the exchange parameters compared to standard exchange-correlation functionals. The results highlight the potential of ASIC as a useful tool for predicting electronic properties of materials and provide insights for future development of more accurate exchange-correlation functionals.
D1-26	"The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a ""soup"" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life."
1460	We construct a new class of physical states of the free Klein-Gordon field in Robertson-Walker spacetimes. This is done by minimizing the expectation value of smeared stress-energy. We get an explicit expression for the state depending on the smearing function. We call it a state of low energy. States of low energy are an improvement of the concept of adiabatic vacua on Robertson-Walker spacetimes. The latter are approximations of the former. It is shown that states of low energy are Hadamard states.
1533	The development of somites, the embryonic precursors of the vertebrate body segments, is regulated by a complex network of genetic interactions. This study aims to investigate how the oscillations observed in this network are converted into the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the synchronization of these oscillations is critical for generating the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. We show that the timing and duration of the oscillations are also important factors in determining the final somite pattern. Our results suggest that the genetic network regulating somite formation is highly sensitive to small changes in its parameters, indicating a robust and precise system. These findings provide insight into the mechanistic basis of somite formation and have implications for understanding the development of other complex biological systems.
210	We report the first experimental demonstration of compensation of beam-beam interaction effects in high-energy particle collider by using space-charge forces of a low-energy electron beam. In our experiments, an electron lens, a novel instrument developed for the beam-beam compensation, was set on a 980-GeV proton bunch in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. The proton bunch losses due to its interaction with antiproton beam were reduced by a factor of 2 when the electron lens was operating. We describe the principle of electron lens operation and present experimental results.
3980	We apply well established finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniques to one dimensional Bose systems with soft and hardcore constraint, as well as to spinless fermion systems. We give clear and robust numerical evidence that, as expected, no superfluid density for Bosons or Meissner fraction for fermions. is possible at {\em any} non zero temperature in one dimensional interacting Bose or fermi lattice models, whereas a finite Drude weight is generally observed in gapless systems, in partial disagreement to previous expectations.
1374	The long-ranged elastic model, which is believed to describe the evolution of a self-affine rough crack-front, is analyzed to linear and non-linear orders. It is shown that the nonlinear terms, while important in changing the front dynamics, are not changing the scaling exponent which characterizes the roughness of the front. The scaling exponent thus predicted by the model is much smaller than the one observed experimentally. The inevitable conclusion is that the gap between the results of experiments and the model that is supposed to describe them is too large, and some new physics has to be invoked for another model.
2835	We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-length Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscattering interaction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function of the bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of the plasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with this picture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasing temperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because for coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the temperature is raised.
325	Parallel transport of a connection in a smooth fibre bundle yields a functor from the path groupoid of the base manifold into a category that describes the fibres of the bundle. We characterize functors obtained like this by two notions we introduce: local trivializations and smooth descent data. This provides a way to substitute categories of functors for categories of smooth fibre bundles with connection. We indicate that this concept can be generalized to connections in categorified bundles, and how this generalization improves the understanding of higher dimensional parallel transport.
1417	We analyze the scaling parameter, extracted from the fidelity for two different ground states, for the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse field near the critical point. It is found that, in the thermodynamic limit, the scaling parameter is singular, and the derivative of its logarithmic function with respect to the transverse field strength is logarithmically divergent at the critical point. The scaling behavior is confirmed numerically by performing a finite size scaling analysis for systems of different sizes, consistent with the conformal invariance at the critical point. This allows us to extract the correlation length critical exponent, which turns out to be universal in the sense that the correlation length critical exponent does not depend on either the anisotropic parameter or the transverse field strength.
2343	The analysis of databases of photographic images of the Sun (obtained in region of soft x-ray) by means of a method of multilevel dynamical contrasting, has shown presence of skeletal structures of the Sun as outside (chromo-sphere flashes and powerful coronal mass ejections) and on the Sun (structures in its atmosphere, protuberances and of solar a stains). Moreover the structures which radius of rotation is less than radius of a solar disk on breadth of their observation have been revealed. On the basis of the obtained results of this analysis, the author puts forward a hypothesis about an opportunity of existence of some filamentary matter as inside, so outside of the Sun.
2239	This research paper investigates the magnetic field penetration in a type-I superconductor and provides evidence for nonmonotonic behavior. The main objective of this study is to understand the complex behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields. The authors conducted experiments on a lead sample and used a sensitive magnetometer to measure the magnetic field inside the superconductor. The results show that the magnetic field penetration is not a monotonic function of the applied field, but instead exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with a peak in the penetration depth. This suggests that the magnetic field interacts with the superconducting electrons in a complex and nontrivial way. The study provides important insights into the behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields and could have implications for the design of superconducting devices.
3089	This research paper aims to constrain the equation of state of dark energy using cosmic voids as a probe. Cosmic voids are regions in the universe with low matter density and can serve as a tool to study the expansion of the universe and the behavior of dark energy. We use the distribution of galaxies in voids to measure the expansion rate and infer the equation of state of dark energy. Our analysis combines data from different surveys and probes the redshift range from 0.2 to 1.2. We find that our results are consistent with a cosmological constant but allow for some deviations from it. Our study demonstrates the potential of cosmic voids as a complementary approach to other probes of dark energy and provides a robust constraint on the equation of state of dark energy.
2306	Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.
2470	This research paper aims to test the validity of disk instability models for giant planet formation. The study utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the outcomes of disk instability in a protoplanetary disk. The findings suggest that disk instability can indeed lead to the formation of giant planets, but the resulting planets have different characteristics compared to those formed through the more commonly accepted core accretion model. The researchers conclude that both disk instability and core accretion models are likely to contribute to giant planet formation in different environments and under different conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider both mechanisms when studying the formation of giant planets in protoplanetary disks.
3515	The Standard Model Extension (SME) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that includes Lorentz violation. Synchrotron radiation is the emission of electromagnetic radiation by charged particles moving through a magnetic field. This paper focuses on the calculation of synchrotron radiation within the context of the SME. The authors find that the presence of Lorentz violation affects the energy spectrum and polarization of the emitted radiation. They also discuss the potential for using synchrotron radiation to test for Lorentz violation in the SME. Overall, the paper provides a theoretical framework for studying synchrotron radiation in the context of the SME and highlights the potential for using synchrotron radiation experiments to test for Lorentz violation.
240	This research paper investigates the ongoing process of galactic accretion, which involves the accumulation of gas and other materials into galaxies. Specifically, the paper focuses on simulations and observations of condensed gas in hot halos, which are the regions surrounding galaxies. Through computer simulations and observations, the study aims to shed light on the mechanisms that drive gas accretion in hot halos and the ways in which this process contributes to the growth and evolution of galaxies. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as for theories of dark matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.
2962	We determine the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U at half-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases. For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in the usual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to a spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition to a novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspond to an incommensurate singlet superconductor.
162	In this research paper, we investigate the Strong and Radiative Decays of Ds0*(2317) Meson in the DK-Molecule. We use a theoretical framework based on the QCD sum rules to study the decay modes of this meson and its properties as a DK-molecule. Our results indicate that the Ds0*(2317) meson has a significant probability for decaying into the DK channel, which is consistent with experimental observations. We also predict the branching ratios for radiative decays of the Ds0*(2317) meson, which can be used to verify our theoretical model. Our findings suggest that the Ds0*(2317) meson is a promising candidate for studying the properties of DK-molecules and can provide insights into the strong and radiative decays of mesons.
1859	We study Markov processes associated with stochastic differential equations, whose non-linearities are gradients of convex functionals. We prove a general result of existence of such Markov processes and a priori estimates on the transition probabilities. The main result is the following stability property: if the associated invariant measures converge weakly, then the Markov processes converge in law. The proofs are based on the interpretation of a Fokker-Planck equation as the steepest descent flow of the relative Entropy functional in the space of probability measures, endowed with the Wasserstein distance. Applications include stochastic partial differential equations and convergence of equilibrium fluctuations for a class of random interfaces.
646	This research paper explores the development of a surface-gated InSb quantum well single electron transistor (SET) for use in low-temperature electronic applications. The primary theme of the study is the use of a surface gate to control the electron transport through the transistor. The researchers found that the surface gate was successful in controlling the electron transport, and they were able to demonstrate single-electron charging effects in the device. The paper also presents an analysis of the device's performance and concludes that the surface-gated SET has the potential to be a promising platform for future electronic applications.
1088	This research paper explores the question of whether the presence of black holes in galaxies is a cause or a consequence of galaxy formation. Through analysis of observational data and theoretical models, the authors present evidence suggesting that black holes may have played a key role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies. The paper concludes that a better understanding of the relationship between black holes and galaxies is essential for developing a comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution.
1198	"We introduce the idea of using adiabatic rotation to generate superpositions of a large class of quantum states. For quantum computing this is an interesting alternative to the well-studied ""straight line"" adiabatic evolution. In ways that complement recent results, we show how to efficiently prepare three types of states: Kitaev's toric code state, the cluster state of the measurement-based computation model and the history state used in the adiabatic simulation of quantum circuit. We also show that the method, when adapted for quantum search, provides quadratic speedup as other optimal methods do with the advantages that the problem Hamiltonian is time-independent and that the energy gap above the ground state is strictly nondecreasing with time. Likewise the method can be used for optimization as an alternative to the usual adiabatic algorithm."
1678	The core of the vortex in the Neel order parameter for an easy-plane antiferromagnet on honeycomb lattice is demonstrated to bind two zero-energy states. Remarkably, a single electron occupying this mid-gap band has its spin fragmented between the two sublattices: Whereas it yields a vanishing total magnetization it shows a finite Neel order, orthogonal to the one of the assumed background. The requisite easy-plane anisotropy may be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer, for example. The results are relevant for spin-1/2 fermions on graphene's or optical honeycomb lattice, in the strongly interacting regime.
2069	Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe, even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.
308	This research paper presents a Bayesian approach for reconstructing the large-scale structure of the universe. We propose a methodology that utilizes inverse algorithms and numerical optimization to reconstruct the cosmological large-scale structure from observed data. The proposed approach is based on the application of the Bayesian framework to the analysis of large-scale structure data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments using real data. Our results show that our proposed methodology provides accurate and reliable reconstructions of the large-scale structure of the universe. The proposed methodology has the potential to improve our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure and its evolution.
3686	We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures.
3020	This research paper explores the potential of tri-layer superlattices as a promising avenue for achieving magnetoelectric multiferroics. Multiferroics, which exhibit both magnetic and electric properties, are crucial for the development of advanced technologies such as data storage and spintronic devices. However, the search for materials that exhibit these properties at room temperature has been challenging. The use of tri-layer superlattices, which are composed of alternating layers of different materials, offers a unique approach to engineering multiferroic properties. This paper reviews the current state of research on tri-layer superlattices and their potential for achieving magnetoelectric multiferroics, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this field.
306	In this paper, we investigate a new waveform for UWB systems obtained by the combination of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The proposed system, called Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple Access (SS-MC-MA) turns out to be a judicious solution to combat frequency selectivity and narrowband interferers, and to manage the coexistence of several users and piconets. It is shown that the addition of a degree of freedom brought by the spreading component of SS-MC-MA allows to optimize jointly the assignment of the number of used codes and coding rates in order to make the system more robust. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the new system can outperform Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA) for low data rates and is able to provide wider range of rates.
3669	This research paper aims to investigate the application of nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods. Lattice Boltzmann methods are widely used for simulating fluid dynamics in complex geometries. However, these methods can lead to unphysical results due to the violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Nonequilibrium entropy limiters are one approach to address this issue by introducing a constraint on the entropy production rate. This paper will explore the impact of entropy limiters on the accuracy and stability of lattice Boltzmann simulations. The study will involve numerical simulations of various flow configurations and comparison with experimental data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of more reliable and accurate lattice Boltzmann methods for fluid dynamics simulations.
2193	"The research paper titled ""Tests of Bayesian Model Selection Techniques for Gravitational Wave Astronomy"" investigates the effectiveness of Bayesian model selection techniques for analyzing data from gravitational wave events. The paper evaluates three different Bayesian model selection methods and compares them to traditional hypothesis testing techniques. The main finding of the study is that the Bayesian methods outperform traditional methods in terms of model selection and estimation accuracy. The paper also highlights the importance of incorporating prior knowledge in the analysis of gravitational wave data. Ultimately, the research demonstrates the potential of Bayesian model selection techniques for improving the accuracy and efficiency of gravitational wave astronomy."
1076	We investigate the effect of different mass of a Bose- and a Fermi-particle on the collective oscillations of the degenerate boson-fermion mixtures. In particular we consider the monopole and the quadrupole modes of the oscillations and study their characters and the frequencies by using variational-sum-rule approach. We find that for both the modes there exists a critical value of the ratio of boson-fermion mass below and above which the character and the frequency of the respective modes are significantly different.
2473	Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other dynamical processes in real network systems.
2391	This research paper focuses on Nonholonomic Ricci Flows, specifically Curve Flows and Solitonic Hierarchies. The authors explore the behavior of curves under the Nonholonomic Ricci flow and describe various solitonic hierarchies that arise from this flow. They also provide a detailed analysis of the geometric properties of these flows and their relationship to other geometric flows. The paper concludes with some important findings related to the structure and behavior of these flows, which can be useful in understanding the dynamics of geometric systems.
759	Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been discovered in the X-ray emission of many neutron stars and black holes. The QPOs with frequencies greater than about 300 Hz are thought to be produced near the surfaces of neutron stars and the event horizons of black holes. I first summarize some of the most important properties of the QPOs seen in neutron star and black hole systems. I then review some of the models that have been proposed and compare them with observational data. Finally, I describe how these QPOs can be used to determine the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields.
2403	This research paper provides an introduction to Arabic speech recognition using the CMUSphinx system. The main focus of the paper is to explore the accuracy and feasibility of using the CMUSphinx system for speech recognition in the Arabic language. The paper also discusses the challenges faced in Arabic speech recognition and how the CMUSphinx system addresses these challenges. The findings of the research suggest that the CMUSphinx system can achieve high accuracy rates in Arabic speech recognition, making it a promising tool for various applications such as voice-controlled systems and language learning tools. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research in this area.
1919	This research paper investigates the existence of periodic solutions for the Schroedinger equation in higher dimensions with nonlocal smoothing nonlinearities. Using variational techniques and critical point theory, we establish the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions for the equation. The main result is that the nonlocal smoothing nonlinearity promotes the existence of periodic solutions even in higher dimensions. This finding has significant implications for the study of nonlinear wave equations and their applications in physics and engineering. The results provide a deeper understanding of the rich dynamics of nonlinear wave equations with nonlocal smoothing nonlinearities.
1461	This research paper explores the states of low energy on Robertson-Walker spacetimes using techniques from quantum field theory. The central focus is on the identification and characterization of these states, which are important for understanding the behavior of quantum fields in cosmological settings. The key findings include the existence of a unique vacuum state that is invariant under the symmetries of the spacetime, as well as the construction of coherent states that provide a semiclassical description of the quantum field. These results have implications for the study of early universe cosmology and the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetimes.
3275	The Navier-Stokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder. This formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergence-free by construction, but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order, whose boundary conditions are coupled. The influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems. The magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior. The influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number.
3661	This research paper discusses the crystal channeling of forward protons in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with preserved distribution in phase space. The study focuses on the use of bent crystals to deflect proton beams, while preserving their momentum and transverse distribution. The results show that crystal channeling can be used to manipulate the trajectory of protons without significantly affecting their phase space distribution. This technique has potential applications in high-energy physics experiments, as well as in medical and industrial applications. The study concludes that crystal channeling is a promising tool for manipulating charged particle beams and that further research is needed to optimize the process for practical applications.
1028	We study the electromagnetic field equations on an arbitrary quantum curved background in the semiclassical approximation of Loop Quantum Gravity. The effective interaction hamiltonian for the Maxwell and gravitational fields is obtained and the corresponding field equations, which can be expressed as a modified wave equation for the Maxwell potential, are derived. We use these results to analyze electromagnetic wave propagation on a quantum Robertson-Walker space time and show that Lorentz Invariance is not preserved. The formalism developed can be applied to the case where back reaction effects on the metric due to the electromagnetic field are taken into account, leading to non covariant field equations.
2889	This research paper presents a novel approach to solving the high energy evolution equation with the inclusion of running coupling corrections. The study utilizes a perturbative QCD approach and employs the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) formalism. The results indicate that the running coupling corrections play a significant role in the evolution of parton distribution functions at high energies. The study also demonstrates the importance of including higher-order corrections in the evolution equation. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of hadrons at high energies and can provide insights into the nature of strong interactions. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of high energy physics and can guide future experimental investigations.
2087	This research paper presents a method to personalize image search results on Flickr by analyzing users' image preferences and search behavior. The proposed method utilizes a probabilistic model to capture users' interests and recommends relevant images based on their preferences. The method is evaluated using a user study, and the results show that personalized image search results improve user satisfaction and increase the likelihood of finding relevant images. This study concludes that personalization is a promising approach to enhance the user experience in image search engines.
2144	Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a fundamental theory of the strong interaction that describes the behavior of quarks and gluons. Despite its success in explaining various phenomena, the theory still faces some fundamental challenges, including the mass gap and the confinement of quarks. In this paper, we review the current understanding of these problems in QCD and discuss recent developments in the field. We focus on the concept of the mass gap and how it relates to the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energies. We also discuss the various approaches that have been proposed to solve the confinement problem, including lattice QCD simulations and effective field theories. Finally, we highlight some of the open questions and future directions in the field and emphasize the importance of continued research in understanding the fundamental properties of QCD.
582	A subset of a group is characteristic if it is invariant under every automorphism of the group. We study word length in fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic surfaces with respect to characteristic generating sets consisting of a finite union of orbits of the automorphism group, and show that the translation length of any element with nonzero crossing number is positive, and bounded below by a constant depending only (and explicitly) on a bound on the crossing numbers of generating elements. This answers a question of B. Farb.
1578	In this article it is shown that, Sommerfeld's coefficients for excitonic transitions in quantum wells are determined only with the principle quantum number within the framework of two-dimensional Coulomb potential. This is a consequence of hidden symmetry of two-dimensional Coulomb problem, conditioned by the existence of two-dimensional analog of the Runge-Lentz vector. For the narrow gap semiconductor quantum well with the non-parabolic dispersion law of electron and hole in the two-band Kane model it is shown that two-dimensional excitonic states are described in the frames of an analog of Klein-Gordon equation with the two-dimensional Coulomb potential. The non-stability of the ground state of the two-dimensional Kane's exciton is show.
1855	Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.) has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry of interaction model (context semantics).
3151	This research paper explores the historical significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 in the development of the concept of gravitational lensing. Through a detailed analysis of historical records and scientific literature, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the observations and interpretations of the nova's behavior, which led to the groundbreaking proposal of the bending of light by gravity. The critical outcomes of this research affirm the significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 as a pivotal event in the history of astrophysics, as it initiated the theoretical framework for gravitational lensing, which has since been confirmed through numerous observations and experiments. This paper concludes that the discovery of Nova Geminorum 1912 and subsequent research in gravitational lensing have broadened our understanding of the universe and opened new avenues for scientific inquiry.
1245	We study the relation between PageRank and other parameters of information networks such as in-degree, out-degree, and the fraction of dangling nodes. We model this relation through a stochastic equation inspired by the original definition of PageRank. Further, we use the theory of regular variation to prove that PageRank and in-degree follow power laws with the same exponent. The difference between these two power laws is in a multiple coefficient, which depends mainly on the fraction of dangling nodes, average in-degree, the power law exponent, and damping factor. The out-degree distribution has a minor effect, which we explicitly quantify. Our theoretical predictions show a good agreement with experimental data on three different samples of the Web.
951	"Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated. In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition. The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification."
3613	This research paper investigates the periodic oscillations of dark solitons in parabolic potentials. The study explores the dynamics of dark solitons, a localized wave packet that maintains its shape while propagating in a nonlinear medium. The findings reveal that the parabolic potential induces periodic oscillations in the soliton's amplitude, phase, and velocity. These oscillations have significant implications for the soliton's stability and suggest potential applications in optical and quantum communication systems. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental properties of dark solitons in different potential landscapes.
2578	The Galactic Center is an area of intense interest for astronomers due to its unique properties and rich astrophysical phenomena. In this paper, we review recent observational and theoretical studies of the Galactic Center, focusing on its supermassive black hole, the stars orbiting it, and the complex interplay of gas and magnetic fields in the region. We discuss the latest results from telescopes and simulations, highlighting the advances in our understanding of the Galactic Center's structure, dynamics, and evolution. Our main conclusions are that the Galactic Center is a unique laboratory for testing fundamental physics, studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, and exploring the potential for life in extreme environments.
956	We introduce a special class of pairwise-independent self-joinings for a stationary process: Those for which one coordinate is a continuous function of the two others. We investigate which properties on the process the existence of such a joining entails. In particular, we prove that if the process is aperiodic, then it has positive entropy. Our other results suggest that such pairwise independent, non-independent self-joinings exist only in very specific situations: Essentially when the process is a subshift of finite type topologically conjugate to a full-shift. This provides an argument in favor of the conjecture that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold-mixing.
1405	In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal) DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental redundancy.
1877	This research paper provides an overview of conservation laws, their relation to the generation of physical fields, and the principles of field theories. The paper examines the significance of conservation laws in understanding the behavior of physical systems and the role they play in the generation of fields. The paper also discusses the principles of field theories, including the concept of symmetry, gauge invariance, and the quantization of fields. Through a comprehensive analysis of these concepts, the paper suggests that a deep understanding of conservation laws and field theories is essential for understanding the fundamental nature of physical phenomena. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of conservation laws and field theories in the development of modern physics and their potential application in future research and technology.
3974	In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularly perturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We use an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximum point of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than the linear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the mean curvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proof of exponential decay of least-energy solutions.
848	This research paper presents a detailed analysis of P2P IPTV traffic, focusing on the scaling properties of the traffic. The authors use real-world data obtained from a large-scale P2P IPTV system to investigate the behavior of the traffic as the number of users and channels increase. They find that the traffic exhibits self-similarity, which can be used to model the traffic and predict its behavior under different conditions. The results have important implications for the design and management of P2P IPTV systems, as they demonstrate the need for scalable solutions that can handle large numbers of users and channels. The study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of P2P IPTV traffic, which can be used to optimize network performance and enhance the user experience.
2478	The Kolmogorov Manifesto proposes that the information content of a system determines its complexity, and that brains are particularly adept at processing this information. This concept has far-reaching implications for understanding the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge. This paper explores the key ideas behind the manifesto and its application to various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science. Ultimately, it argues that the Kolmogorov Manifesto provides a powerful framework for understanding the complex systems that make up our world.
1878	We report 10 successfully folding events of trpzip2 by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the trizip2 can fold into its native state through different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming hydrophobic core. We also find a very fast non-zipper pathway. This indicates that there may be no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms. These pathways occur with different probabilities. zip-out is the most probable one. This may explain the recent experiment that the turn formation is the rate-limiting step for beta-hairpin folding.
D2-91	The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state known as a singularity. This singularity then rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, causing space itself to stretch exponentially in a fraction of a second. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing matter to form, leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and eventually the structure of the universe we observe today. Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes the cosmic microwave background radiation (a faint glow left over from the early universe), the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
2897	This research paper investigates the possibility of d-wave superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors through electron-phonon interactions. The primary theme focuses on understanding the mechanism behind the unconventional pairing symmetry in these superconductors. The study uses theoretical calculations and analysis to explore how the electron-phonon interaction can lead to d-wave superconductivity. The significant findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling can play a crucial role in the emergence of d-wave superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. The paper concludes that a better understanding of these interactions can lead to the development of new materials and technologies in the field of superconductivity.
1170	We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.
702	This paper investigates the non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles around rapidly rotating Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black holes. We analyze the behavior of test particles in the vicinity of these black holes and show that the presence of a negative cosmological constant can lead to a non-monotonic behavior in the velocity profile. We also examine the effects of the rotation parameter on the velocity profile and demonstrate that it can cause significant deviations from the monotonically increasing behavior observed in the case of non-rotating black holes. Our results have important implications for understanding the dynamics of objects in the vicinity of rapidly spinning black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant, and may have implications for astrophysical observations of these objects.
388	Killing-Yano tensors are natural generalizations of Killing vectors. We investigate whether Killing-Yano tensors form a graded Lie algebra with respect to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. We find that this proposition does not hold in general, but that it does hold for constant curvature spacetimes. We also show that Minkowski and (anti)-deSitter spacetimes have the maximal number of Killing-Yano tensors of each rank and that the algebras of these tensors under the SN bracket are relatively simple extensions of the Poincare and (A)dS symmetry algebras.
2535	We discuss exact solutions of three-parameter non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills model, which describe the wormholes of a new type. These wormholes are considered to be supported by SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills field, non-minimally coupled to gravity, the Wu-Yang ansatz for the gauge field being used. We distinguish between regular solutions, describing traversable non-minimal Wu-Yang wormholes, and black wormholes possessing one or two event horizons. The relation between the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang wormhole and its throat radius is analysed.
3429	We show theoretically that it is possible to trap and cool the rotational motion of a macroscopic mirror made of a perfectly reflecting spiral phase element using orbital angular momentum transfer from a Laguerre-Gaussian optical field. This technique offers a promising route to the placement of the rotor in its quantum mechanical ground state in the presence of thermal noise. It also opens up the possibility of simultaneously cooling a vibrational mode of the same mirror. Lastly, the proposed design may serve as a sensitive torsional balance in the quantum regime.
1949	This research paper investigates the magnetic induction in a turbulent flow of liquid sodium by examining the mean behavior and slow fluctuations. The study uses numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the magnetic induction equation to analyze the behavior of liquid sodium under magnetic fields. The results indicate that the mean behavior of the liquid sodium is significantly affected by the magnetic field, with the flow becoming more organized and aligned with the magnetic field direction. On the other hand, slow fluctuations in the flow are found to be less affected by the magnetic field. The findings of this study have important implications for the design and operation of liquid metal cooling systems in nuclear reactors and other industrial applications.
527	Recent progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model the non-perturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. Based on these results, we propose a phenomenological family of waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of black hole coalescence. We also construct a template bank using this family of waveforms and discuss its implementation in the search for signatures of gravitational waves produced by black-hole coalescences in the data of ground-based interferometers. This template bank might enable us to extend the present inspiral searches to higher-mass binary black-hole systems, i.e., systems with total mass greater than about 80 solar masses, thereby increasing the reach of the current generation of ground-based detectors.
276	We explore further the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions in terms of gauge-invariant matrix variables. Coupling to scalar matter fields is discussed in terms of gauge-invariant fields. We analyze how the screening of adjoint (and other screenable) representations can arise in this formalism. A Schrodinger equation is then derived for the gluelump states which are the daughter states when an adjoint string breaks. A variational solution of this Schrodinger equation leads to an analytic estimate of the string-breaking energy which is within 8.8% of the latest lattice estimates.
297	We show that the arithmetic D-module associated to an overconvergent F-isocrystal over a smooth curve is holonomic. We first prove that unipotent F-isocrystals are holonomic D-module by using the fact that such F-isocrystals come from logarithmic F-isocrystals. We deduce the general case from the semi-stable theorem for F-isocrystals over curves of Matsuda-Trihan which relies on the p-adic monodromy theorem independently proved by Andr\'e, Kedlaya and Mebkhout. The main result has already been proved by D. Caro.
3051	This research paper explores the occurrence and properties of chromospheric flares, which are sudden bursts of energy in the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere. The authors analyze data from various sources, including ground-based telescopes and space-based instruments, to better understand the physical mechanisms behind these events. They find that chromospheric flares are often associated with magnetic reconnection, a process by which magnetic fields in the sun's atmosphere release energy and produce high-energy particles. The authors conclude that studying chromospheric flares can provide insight into the dynamics of the sun's atmosphere and its impact on space weather.
947	About a dozen field RR Lyrae stars have been observed with the 24-inch Heyde-Zeiss telescope of the Konkoly Observatory at Sv\'abhegy, Budapest, since its refurbishment in 2003. Most of the observing time is allocated for the investigation of the Blazhko modulation, a phenomenon that still does not have a satisfactory explanation. The obtained multicolour CCD observations are unique in extent. The accuracy of the measurements makes it possible to detect low amplitude modulation of the light curve as well. The discovery of Blazhko stars with low modulation amplitudes warns that the incidence rate of the Blazhko modulation is, in fact, much larger than it was previously expected. This makes the efforts exploring the cause of the modulation even more important. A summary of our measurements and results achieved during the last 3 years is presented.
3138	"The research paper titled ""Spectroscopy of Nine Cataclysmic Variable Stars"" presents a spectroscopic analysis of nine cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) using the 4.2-meter William Herschel Telescope. The study focused on determining the physical properties of the CVs, such as the mass and temperature of the accretion disk, and the nature of the white dwarf. The results showed that the CVs exhibited a range of properties, including different accretion disk temperatures and white dwarf masses. The study also identified one system as a candidate for a future supernova explosion, highlighting the importance of continued monitoring of these systems. Overall, the paper provides insights into the physical properties and evolutionary histories of CVs, which are important for understanding stellar astrophysics and the formation of compact objects."
243	We derive single-particle and two-particle correlators of anyons in the presence of a magnetic field in the lowest Landau level. We show that the two-particle correlator exhibits signatures of fractional statistics which can distinguish anyons from their fermionic and bosonic counterparts. These signatures include the zeroes of the two-particle correlator and its exclusion behavior. We find that the single-particle correlator in finite geometries carries valuable information relevant to experiments in which quasiparticles on the edge of a quantum Hall system tunnel through its bulk.
3033	This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
1327	This research paper investigates the Laplace operator in networks of thin fibers, focusing on the spectrum near the threshold. The authors use an approach based on the asymptotic analysis of the operator's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. They provide a detailed analysis of the spectrum, including the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as the thickness of the fibers tends to zero. The study shows that the spectrum is highly sensitive to the geometry of the network and the distribution of the fibers. The authors also derive explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions near the threshold. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of networks of thin fibers, such as those used in material science and engineering.
1683	This research paper presents hydrodynamical simulations of the jet in the symbiotic star MWC 560 III, with a focus on understanding X-ray jets in symbiotic stars. The simulations reveal that the jet is highly collimated and has a strong shock structure, which is consistent with observations of similar systems. The results also suggest that the jet is likely powered by accretion onto a compact object, such as a white dwarf or neutron star. The study provides important insights into the physics of symbiotic star jets and their contribution to the overall energy budget of these systems. Overall, the findings of this research paper have significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of X-ray jets in symbiotic stars.
1915	This research paper presents an experimental test of non-local realism using a complex Bell inequality. The experiment involved two entangled photons and measurements performed on both photons at different locations. The results were compared to the predictions of local realism, and it was found that the experimental data violated the inequality, indicating the presence of non-local correlations. These findings suggest that non-local realism cannot be reconciled with quantum mechanics, supporting the idea that entanglement is a fundamental feature of the quantum world.
3136	This paper presents high-resolution observations of molecular gas in the vicinity of the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The study reveals significant jet-induced disturbances in the molecular gas, including a bent arm and a bright knot, which are likely caused by the interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium. The researchers also find evidence of inflowing gas towards the central region of the galaxy, which suggests that the jet may be triggering or fueling the nuclear activity. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between jets, molecular gas, and nuclear activity in galaxies.
3240	This research paper explores the use of free zero-range processes on networks as a basis for studying complex systems. Zero-range processes have been widely used in the study of particle systems, but their application to networked systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the properties of free zero-range processes on networks and demonstrate their usefulness in modeling a range of phenomena, from traffic flow to the spread of disease. We also provide a theoretical framework for analyzing these processes and discuss their potential applications in fields such as physics, biology, and engineering. Our findings suggest that free zero-range processes on networks offer a promising approach for understanding the behavior of complex systems and may lead to new insights and discoveries in a variety of fields.
128	This research paper presents an inverse regression approach for implementing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with functional inputs. The proposed approach is based on a novel algorithm that utilizes the MLP's ability to approximate functions and solves an inverse problem to estimate the functional inputs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, as the MLP with functional inputs outperforms traditional MLPs for certain datasets. The study concludes that incorporating functional inputs into MLPs can improve their performance and suggests further exploration of this approach for other applications.
1987	Bayesian probability theory is used to analyze the oft-made assumption that humans are typical observers in the universe. Some theoretical calculations make the {\it selection fallacy} that we are randomly chosen from a class of objects by some physical process, despite the absence of any evidence for such a process, or any observational evidence favoring our typicality. It is possible to favor theories in which we are typical by appropriately choosing their prior probabilities, but such assumptions should be made explicit to avoid confusion.
2635	We show that an unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity implies that there is a fundamental length in Nature in the sense that no operational procedure would be able to measure distances shorter than the Planck length. Furthermore we give an explicit realization of an old proposal by Anderson and Finkelstein who argued that a fundamental length in nature implies unimodular gravity. Finally, using hand waving arguments we show that a minimal length might be related to the cosmological constant which, if this scenario is realized, is time dependent.
459	Following an approach based on generating function method phase space characteristics of Landau system are studied in the autonomous framework of deformation quantization. Coherent state property of generating functions is established and marginal probability densities along canonical coordinate lines are derived. Well defined analogs of inner product, Cauchy-Bunyakowsy-Schwarz inequality and state functional have been defined in phase space and they have been used in analyzing the uncertainty structures. The general form of the uncertainty relation for two real-valued functions is derived and uncertainty products are computed in states described by Wigner functions. Minimum uncertainty state property of the standard coherent states is presented and uncertainty structures in the case of phase space generalized coherent states are analyzed.
2796	"The research paper titled ""Green function theory versus Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for thin magnetic films"" compares two different methods for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. The main subject of the paper is to determine which method is more accurate and efficient for this type of calculation. The key finding of the paper is that both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but overall, the Quantum Monte Carlo method is more accurate for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. However, the Green function theory method is still useful for providing insight into the underlying physics of the system. The paper concludes that both methods should be used in conjunction with each other for a more complete understanding of the magnetic properties of thin films."
1776	Recently, one of us (H.S.) gave an explicit form of the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action of QED. We first rederive the identity using a functional method. The identity makes it possible to realize the gauge symmetry even in the presence of a momentum cutoff. In the cutoff dependent realization, the abelian nature of the gauge symmetry is lost, breaking the nilpotency of the BRS transformation. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we extend the Wilson action by including the antifield contributions. Then, the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action is lifted to a quantum master equation, and the modified BRS transformation regains nilpotency. We also obtain a flow equation for the extended Wilson action.
2958	We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail, with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes. However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent interference minima.
D2-20	For a fossil to exist it needs to survive a long time. Many animals are active kills by predictors. In such cases one might find a few teeth but most bone and tissue is gone. In rain forests the amount of insects make finding anything unlikely. Any animal is quickly dissected. Bones often dissolve in the slightly acid rain. Good places to find fossils are hence riverbeds or banks where cold freezing water quickly kills the animal and sediments are readily available to bury the remains long enough to begin the next step in the fossilization process. Similarly lakes that break through a wall and empty might evaporate and have large amount of fish and other animals.
3821	We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.
2786	This research paper proposes a framework for studying discrete nonholonomic Lagrangian systems on Lie groupoids. The authors establish the necessary mathematical background and develop a discrete version of the Euler-Lagrange equations for such systems. They also investigate the symmetries and conservation laws associated with these equations. Finally, the authors apply their framework to a simple example and demonstrate its usefulness in analyzing the behavior of nonholonomic systems. Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of nonholonomic mechanics and offers a promising avenue for future research.
708	"The research paper titled ""Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward"" presents an analysis of the diversity performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multihop relay channels using the amplify-and-forward (AF) technique. The paper evaluates the impact of different relay paths and antenna configurations on the diversity gain achieved by the system. The results show that increasing the number of relay nodes and antennas can significantly improve the diversity gain, while the choice of relay path also plays a crucial role. The paper concludes that careful optimization of the relay node locations and antenna configurations can lead to improved diversity performance in MIMO AF multihop relay channels."
196	"The research paper titled ""J1128+592: a highly variable IDV source"" investigates the variability of the quasar J1128+592 at radio wavelengths. The study finds that J1128+592 exhibits extreme inter-day variability (IDV) with flux density variations of up to 50% on timescales of a few hours. The authors conclude that the variability is likely due to scintillation caused by turbulence in the interstellar medium. The study provides valuable insights into the nature of IDV sources and their potential for use in high-precision astrometry and geodesy."
1078	"The research paper titled ""A Simple Optical Analysis of Gravitational Lensing"" explores the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The main subject of the paper is to analyze the optical effects of gravitational lensing on light by demonstrating a simple model. The study shows that the lensing effect can be explained by using the laws of geometric optics, and the focal length of the lens can be calculated by measuring the distance between the observer, the lens, and the source. The essential findings of the research highlight the importance of gravitational lensing in astrophysics and cosmology. The paper concludes that understanding the phenomenon of gravitational lensing can lead to a better understanding of the universe's structure and evolution."
228	We develop a framework for derived deformation theory, valid in all characteristics. This gives a model category reconciling local and global approaches to derived moduli theory. In characteristic 0, we use this to show that the homotopy categories of DGLAs and SHLAs (L infinity algebras) considered by Kontsevich, Hinich and Manetti are equivalent, and are compatible with the derived stacks of Toen--Vezzosi and Lurie. Another application is that the cohomology groups associated to any classical deformation problem (in any characteristic) admit the same operations as Andre--Quillen cohomology.
3972	We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.
3389	This research paper presents the optimization of a novel prismatic drive, which is a type of linear actuator. The design is based on a combination of a prismatic joint and a cam mechanism. The optimization process involves the selection of appropriate design parameters to achieve maximum efficiency and minimum energy consumption. The results of the study show that the optimized prismatic drive has significantly improved performance compared to traditional linear actuation methods. The novel design can be used in a range of applications, including robotics, automation, and manufacturing. The study concludes that the prismatic drive offers a promising alternative to traditional linear actuators, with potential for further optimization and improvement.
1264	This research paper investigates the dependence of resonant relaxation on the eccentricity of orbits in the vicinity of a massive black hole. By employing numerical simulations, the study reveals that the rate of resonant relaxation is strongly influenced by the eccentricity of the orbits. The results suggest that highly eccentric orbits experience faster relaxation than nearly circular orbits, leading to a significant impact on the dynamical evolution of stellar systems near massive black holes. The study concludes that understanding the dependence of resonant relaxation on eccentricity is crucial for accurately modeling the dynamics of galactic nuclei.
404	We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom. We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and lifestyle choices, and respite from technology.
491	The holographic conjecture for black holes localized on a 3-brane in Randall-Sundrum braneworld models RS2 predicts the existence of a classical 5D time dependent solution dual to a 4D evaporating black hole. After briefly reviewing recent criticism and presenting some difficulties in the holographic interpretation of the Gregory-Laflamme instability, we simulate some basic features of such a solution by studying null geodesics of the Schwarzschild black string, in particular those propagating nontrivially in the bulk, and using holographic arguments.
1423	In this paper we obtain the weak type (1,1) boundedness of Calderon-Zygmund operators acting over operator-valued functions. Our main tools for its solution are a noncommutative form of Calderon-Zygmund decomposition in conjunction with a pseudo-localization principle for singular integrals, which is new even in the classical setting and of independent interest. Perhaps because of the hidden role of pseudo-localization and almost orthogonality, this problem has remained open for quite some time. We also consider Calderon-Zygmund operators associated to certain operator-valued kernels.
3451	Fermi, Pasta and Ulam observed, that the excitation of a low frequency normal mode in a nonlinear acoustic chain leads to localization in normal mode space on large time scales. Fast equipartition (and thus complete delocalization) in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain is restored if relevant intensive control parameters exceed certain threshold values. We compare recent results on periodic orbits (in the localization regime) and resonant normal forms (in a weak delocalization regime), and relate them to various resonance overlap criteria. We show that the approaches quantitatively agree in their estimate of the localization-delocalization threshold. A key ingredient for this transition are resonances of overtones.
3764	This research paper presents a new computer program designed for efficient non-LTE analysis of interstellar line spectra. The program is capable of handling large datasets and complex physical conditions, making it a valuable tool for studying interstellar medium. The study also highlights the importance of non-LTE analysis in accurately determining the physical properties and chemical composition of interstellar gas. The findings suggest that the program can significantly improve the accuracy and speed of analyzing interstellar line spectra, enabling more detailed and comprehensive studies of interstellar gas.
2905	We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.
3285	We reveal the existence of systematic variations of isobaric fragility in different supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixtures by performing molecular dynamics simulations. The connection between fragility and local structures in the bulk is analyzed by means of a Voronoi construction. We find that clusters of particles belonging to locally preferred structures form slow, long-lived domains, whose spatial extension increases by decreasing temperature. As a general rule, a more rapid growth, upon supercooling, of such domains is associated to a more pronounced super-Arrhenius behavior, hence to a larger fragility.
3917	This research paper investigates the impact of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four-dimensional Universe. The study employs theoretical models and computational simulations to explore the behavior of energy conservation in different scenarios where a fifth dimension is present, absent, or varying in size. The results indicate that the existence of a fifth dimension may significantly affect the conservation of energy, depending on its properties and interactions with the four-dimensional space-time. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and their implications for the structure and dynamics of the Universe.
755	We present a numerical study of a quantum phase transition from a spin-polarized to a topologically ordered phase in a system of spin-1/2 particles on a torus. We demonstrate that this non-symmetry-breaking topological quantum phase transition (TOQPT) is of second order. The transition is analyzed via the ground state energy and fidelity, block entanglement, Wilson loops, and the recently proposed topological entropy. Only the topological entropy distinguishes the TOQPT from a standard QPT, and remarkably, does so already for small system sizes. Thus the topological entropy serves as a proper order parameter. We demonstrate that our conclusions are robust under the addition of random perturbations, not only in the topological phase, but also in the spin polarized phase and even at the critical point.
3458	This research paper focuses on the uniqueness and non-uniqueness of chains on half lines. In particular, the study investigates the conditions under which a chain on a half line is unique or non-unique. The paper employs a rigorous mathematical analysis to explore various scenarios that may lead to either uniqueness or non-uniqueness of chains. The findings of this research have significant applications in several fields, including physics, engineering, and mathematics. This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of chains on half lines, which can aid in the development of more accurate models and simulations in various applications.
2717	The study focuses on using X-ray observations to investigate the properties of Compact Extragalactic Radio Jets (CERJs) in the MOJAVE sample. The researchers analyzed data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and found that the X-ray emission from the CERJs is consistent with synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons. They also found evidence of X-ray emission from the hotspots of some CERJs, which suggests that the hotspots are sites of particle acceleration. The study provides important insights into the physical processes occurring in CERJs and highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations in studying these objects.
1539	"The research paper titled ""On the detectability of non-trivial topologies"" investigates the ability of statistical methods to identify complex network structures. The main focus of the study is to determine the detectability limit of non-trivial topologies, i.e., whether or not statistical methods can accurately identify network structures that are not easily discernible. The research uses simulations to test the performance of various statistical methods in detecting different network topologies. The results reveal that the detectability limit depends on the complexity of the topology and the size of the network. The study concludes that statistical methods can reliably detect non-trivial topologies under certain conditions, but caution is needed when interpreting results."
998	The harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short, intense infrared laser pulses is analyzed by means of particle-in-cell simulations. A pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.
298	Using former maps, geographers intend to study the evolution of the land cover in order to have a prospective approach on the future landscape; predictions of the future land cover, by the use of older maps and environmental variables, are usually done through the GIS (Geographic Information System). We propose here to confront this classical geographical approach with statistical approaches: a linear parametric model (polychotomous regression modeling) and a nonparametric one (multilayer perceptron). These methodologies have been tested on two real areas on which the land cover is known at various dates; this allows us to emphasize the benefit of these two statistical approaches compared to GIS and to discuss the way GIS could be improved by the use of statistical models.

1607	"The research paper titled ""The origin of X-ray emission from T Tauri stars"" investigates the source of X-ray emissions from young stars known as T Tauri stars. The study suggests that the X-ray emissions are caused by magnetic fields that are generated by the star's rotation and the presence of a surrounding disk of gas and dust. The researchers used observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the emission from T Tauri stars and found that the X-rays are primarily generated in the star's corona, which is the outermost layer of the star's atmosphere. The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of young stars and their surrounding environments."
1980	This research paper conducts a comparative analysis between two popular methods, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Langevin thermostats, for out-of-equilibrium simulations of polymeric systems. The primary focus is to determine the accuracy and efficiency of each method in reproducing non-equilibrium behavior of polymeric systems. The study reveals that both methods can effectively simulate non-equilibrium behavior, but DPD is more accurate and efficient in capturing the complex dynamics of polymeric systems, particularly for systems with high molecular weight. The findings of this research have significant implications for the design and optimization of polymeric materials for various applications.

Our results show that the extent of the eigenstates plays a crucial role in determining the resonance frequencies and widths, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for weak coupling strengths. We discuss the implications of our findings for various physical systems, including atoms, molecules, and solid-state devices, and suggest possible avenues for future experimental and theoretical research. Overall, this study sheds new light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying resonance phenomena and provides important insights into the design and optimization of resonant devices and systems.
2566	We argue that claims about magnetic field dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth lambda, which were made on the basis of moun-spin-rotation studies of some superconductors, originate from insufficient accuracy of theoretical models employed for the data analysis. We also reanalyze some of already published experimental data and demonstrate that numerical calculations of Brandt [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 68, 54506 (2003)] may serve as a reliable and powerful tool for the analysis of the data collected in experiments with conventional superconductors. Furthermore, one can use this approach in order to distinguish between conventional and unconventional superconductors. It is unfortunate that these calculations have practically never been employed for such analyses.
D1-19	There seems to be some merit to having a single daily glass of red wine, it seems to have something called resveratrol, which acts as an antioxidant and is thought to be good for your heart. Additionally, Italian researchers found that moderate beer drinkers had a 42 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to non-drinkers. For maximum protection, keep your consumption to one pint—at around 5 percent alcohol by volume—a day, the researchers say. Basically, alcohol, in moderation, appears to lower risks of heart and other cardiovascular disease.But this is in moderation, mind you. Just as with everything else, the only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. A beer a day is good; twelve is not.
697	The manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising technique for a variety of applications ranging from laser cooling and trapping to coherent atom transport and matter wave interferometry. Optical fields have also been proposed as interesting tools for quantum information processing with cold atoms. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a cold 87Rb atomic cloud falling in the gravity field in the presence of two crossing dipole guides. The cloud is either deflected or split between the two branches of this guide. We explore the possibilities of optimization of this device and present preliminary results obtained in the case of zero-temperature dilute Bose-Einstein condensates.
740	This research paper proposes a new protocol for demonstrating topological order that does not require the use of interferometry. The protocol involves creating a series of topological defects in a 2D lattice and measuring the response of the system to those defects. This response can be used to infer the presence of topological order. We show that the protocol is robust to noise and disorder, and can be used to distinguish between different types of topological order. The protocol has the potential to greatly simplify the experimental demonstration of topological order in a wide range of systems. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the protocol and present experimental results on a photonic platform.
2205	The research paper discusses the concept of gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories. Gauge invariance is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the physical laws should remain the same even when the gauge is changed. The paper explores the impact of massive gauge fields on gauge invariance and the resulting gravitational interactions. The research concludes that gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories can be made gauge invariant by introducing a scalar field that couples to the gauge fields. This coupling allows for the existence of a mass term without breaking the gauge symmetry, leading to consistent gravitational interactions. The findings have important implications for the development of unified theories of fundamental interactions.

Our results suggest that GD 362 is a product of a binary white dwarf merger, providing new evidence for the importance of these events in the formation and evolution of white dwarfs. The paper highlights the significance of studying binary white dwarf systems to further understand the astrophysical processes that govern the evolution of stars and the formation of compact objects.

The research provides valuable insights into the behavior of MHD equilibria and offers potential applications in plasma physics and astrophysics.
1887	This research paper presents an investigation of the Larkin-Imry-Ma (LIM) state in 3He-A confined in aerogel. The LIM state is a unique phase of matter that arises due to the interplay between superfluidity and disorder. Through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and ultrasound measurements, the authors explore the effects of aerogel on the LIM state and observe a reduction in the critical velocity for the onset of turbulence. This suggests that the presence of aerogel enhances the effects of disorder and weakens the superfluidity of 3He-A. These findings have implications for the understanding of superfluidity in disordered systems and may have practical applications in the design of new materials for quantum computing and other technologies.
2003	The problem of joint universal source coding and modeling, treated in the context of lossless codes by Rissanen, was recently generalized to fixed-rate lossy coding of finitely parametrized continuous-alphabet i.i.d. sources. We extend these results to variable-rate lossy block coding of stationary ergodic sources and show that, for bounded metric distortion measures, any finitely parametrized family of stationary sources satisfying suitable mixing, smoothness and Vapnik-Chervonenkis learnability conditions admits universal schemes for joint lossy source coding and identification. We also give several explicit examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions.

2777	The research paper aims to investigate the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices on the surfaces of four Uranian moons - Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon - using spectroscopic observations from the Infrared Telescope Facility/Spectral Energy Distribution Camera. The study found that all four moons exhibited significant variations in the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices, with Ariel and Umbriel showing the highest concentrations of CO2 ice and Titania and Oberon having the highest concentrations of H2O ice.

Additionally, we identify a critical groove depth at which the SPP scattering behavior undergoes a dramatic change. These results have important implications for the design and optimization of plasmonic devices and systems.

We find an exact mapping of this quantum-relativistic system onto a Jaynes-Cummings model, describing the interaction of a two-level atom with a quantized single-mode field. This equivalence allows us to map a series of quantum optical phenomena onto the relativistic oscillator, and viceversa. We make a realistic experimental proposal, at reach with current technology, for studying the equivalence of both models using a single trapped ion.

These findings provide insights into the underlying structure of the universe and have important implications for our understanding of cosmology.
790	The research paper focuses on studying the behavior of inertial particles in turbulent flows. Specifically, the authors examine the Lyapunov exponents, which are used to quantify how fast nearby trajectories in the flow diverge or converge. They derive a fluctuation relation for these exponents, which relates the probability of observing a certain value of the exponent to the probability of observing the opposite value. They also propose a pairing rule for the exponents, which predicts that they should occur in pairs with opposite signs. The authors use numerical simulations to validate their theoretical predictions and find that the fluctuation relation and pairing rule hold for a wide range of particle sizes and flow parameters. These findings provide insights into the statistical properties of turbulent flows and have implications for understanding the dynamics of particle transport in such flows.
3866	We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.

We compute zero momentum hydrodynamic response functions of maximally supersymmetric 2+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at the conformal fixed point, in the large N limit. With background magnetic field B and electric charge density rho, the Hall conductivity is found to be rho/B. The result, anticipated on kinematic grounds in field theory, is obtained from perturbations of a four dimensional AdS black hole with both electric and magnetic charges.

The findings suggest that the phase stability of the generator can be improved by reducing the influence of these factors. The study concludes that the characterization of instrumental phase stability is crucial for the accurate and reliable operation of signal processing systems.

248	This research paper investigates the existence and properties of symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in optical lattices. The theoretical analysis is based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the numerical simulations are performed using the split-step Fourier method. We demonstrate that symmetric solitons can exist in BECs with equal coupling strengths, while asymmetric solitons can appear in BECs with unequal coupling strengths. The stability of the solitons is also analyzed and it is found that the symmetric solitons are more stable than the asymmetric ones. Additionally, the influence of the lattice depth on the soliton properties is investigated. Our findings can be used to design and control soliton dynamics in BEC systems, which have potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurements.
D2-41	Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are part of the Standard Model of particle physics and are classified as elementary particles, meaning they have no known substructure. Quarks come in six types, or flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. They always exist in groups, held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called gluons. The most common quarks in nature are up and down, which combine to form protons and neutrons. Quarks have fractional electric charges and cannot exist independently outside of bound states due to a phenomenon called color confinement.
2829	In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad, associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form, initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of the standard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition into indecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad. As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete description of the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.
3960	"In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the exclusion principle ""Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential surface simultaneously"" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic energies."

They have used various experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, resistivity measurements, and Raman spectroscopy to study the charge ordering behavior. The study concludes that the charge ordering in this material is a result of a competition between Coulomb repulsion and lattice energy, which can be tuned by external stimuli such as pressure or temperature.
3064	A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D, contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

Directed polymers are important models in statistical physics and have been extensively studied in recent years. In this work, we use the optimal fluctuation method to study the properties of directed polymers in a random medium. We derive the equations of motion for the optimal fluctuation and investigate its properties. We also consider the case of a directed polymer in a quenched random medium and derive the equation of motion for the optimal fluctuation in this case. We then use the optimal fluctuation approach to study the properties of the directed polymer in the random medium. Our results show that the optimal fluctuation approach is a powerful tool for studying directed polymers in random media and can provide insights into their behavior.

3530	In several self-coupled quantum field theories when treated in semi-classical limit one obtains solitonic solutions determined by topology of the boundary conditions. Such solutions, e.g. magnetic monopole in unified theories \cite{Hooft1974} \cite{Polyakov1974} or the skyrme model of hadrons have been proposed as possible non-perturbative bound states which remain stable due to topological quantum numbers. Furthermore when fermions are introduced, under certain conditions one obtains zero-energy solutions \cite{Vega1978}\cite{Jackiw1981} for the Dirac equations localised on the soliton. An implication of such zero-modes is induced fermion number \cite{Jackiw1977} carried by the soliton.
2691	This research paper investigates the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight within the framework of the rotationally-invariant slave-boson formalism. The slave-boson formalism is a powerful tool for describing strongly correlated electron systems, and a rotationally-invariant version has been developed to accurately capture the effects of anisotropy in the electron system. We apply this formalism to investigate the quasiparticle weight, which characterizes the strength of the interactions between electrons and their surrounding environment. Our results show that the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight is strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the system, and we provide a detailed analysis of this effect. This research has important implications for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems, and may provide insights into the design of new materials with desirable electronic properties.
2372	Kontsevitch's work on Airy matrix integrals has led to explicit results for the intersection numbers of the moduli space of curves. In a subsequent work Okounkov rederived these results from the edge behavior of a Gaussian matrix integral. In our work we consider the correlation functions of vertices in a Gaussian random matrix theory, with an external matrix source, in a scaling limit in which the powers of the matrices and their sizes go to infinity simultaneously in a specified scale. We show that the replica method applied to characteristic polynomials of the random matrices, together with a duality exchanging N and the number of points, allows one to recover Kontsevich's results on the intersection numbers, through a simple saddle-point analysis.

They also study the fragmentation of spin and find that it is sensitive to the anisotropy of the spin interactions. The authors conclude that the zero-energy states and fragmentation of spin in the easy-plane antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice are important factors that need to be considered when studying the properties of such systems.
1192	The Drell-Yan process is a standard tool for probing the partonic structure of hadrons. Since the process proceeds through a quark-antiquark annihilation, Drell-Yan scattering possesses a unique ability to selectively probe sea distributions. This review examines the application of Drell-Yan scattering to elucidating the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon's sea and nuclear modifications to the sea quark distributions in unpolarized scattering. Polarized beams and targets add an exciting new dimension to Drell-Yan scattering. In particular, the two initial-state hadrons give Drell-Yan sensitivity to chirally-odd transversity distributions.
1844	This research paper delves into the concept of induced inflation, which suggests that the inflationary period in the early universe was initiated by the dynamics of a scalar field. The study specifically focuses on a 5D purely kinetic scalar field formalism on warped product spaces and explores its implications for the inflationary model. Through a detailed analysis of the field equations and the resulting cosmological solutions, the study finds that the formalism can lead to a successful inflationary scenario that matches observational data. The research also highlights the role of the extra dimensions in the inflationary dynamics and sheds light on the mechanism responsible for the generation of primordial perturbations. Overall, the study presents a novel approach to understanding the early universe and offers insights into the nature of inflation and the structure of the cosmos.
3155	The separability criterion for multipartite pure states is an important problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a multipartite pure state can be written as a tensor product of individual states. We present a new separability criterion based on the concept of Schmidt rank and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for separability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our criterion by applying it to a number of examples of multipartite pure states. Our results provide a useful tool for analyzing the entanglement properties of multipartite pure states and have potential applications in quantum information processing.
1932	The complementary strands of DNA molecules can be separated when stretched apart by a force; the unzipping signal is correlated to the base content of the sequence but is affected by thermal and instrumental noise. We consider here the ideal case where opening events are known to a very good time resolution (very large bandwidth), and study how the sequence can be reconstructed from the unzipping data. Our approach relies on the use of statistical Bayesian inference and of Viterbi decoding algorithm. Performances are studied numerically on Monte Carlo generated data, and analytically. We show how multiple unzippings of the same molecule may be exploited to improve the quality of the prediction, and calculate analytically the number of required unzippings as a function of the bandwidth, the sequence content, the elasticity parameters of the unzipped strands.
94	This research paper compares the radiation hardness of diamond and silicon sensors. The primary focus is to determine which material is better suited for use in radiation-intensive environments, such as those found in space or nuclear facilities. The study found that diamond sensors have higher radiation tolerance compared to silicon sensors, making them a more suitable choice for such applications. The paper concludes that diamond sensors have the potential to revolutionize radiation detection technology due to their superior radiation hardness.
971	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of planetary migration to large radii, which occurs when planets move from their initial orbits to larger, more distant orbits. We examine the mechanisms that drive planetary migration, such as interactions with other planets and the protoplanetary disk. Through numerical simulations, we find that planetary migration is a common occurrence and can result in the formation of hot Jupiters and other massive planets in close proximity to their host stars. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the diversity of exoplanetary systems and the processes that shape their evolution.
67	In this paper we outline several points of view on the interplay between discrete and continuous wavelet transforms; stressing both pure and applied aspects of both. We outline some new links between the two transform technologies based on the theory of representations of generators and relations. By this we mean a finite system of generators which are represented by operators in Hilbert space. We further outline how these representations yield sub-band filter banks for signal and image processing algorithms.
D2-28	Fossils have played a significant role in shaping Greek mythology, as ancient Greeks often interpreted large, mysterious bones as evidence of mythical creatures. The discovery of massive fossils, such as those of mammoths, mastodons, and prehistoric reptiles, likely influenced myths about giants, cyclopes, and dragons. For instance, the large skulls of prehistoric elephants, which have a central nasal cavity, may have been mistaken for the skulls of one-eyed Cyclopes, reinforcing the legend of these formidable beings. Similarly, fossilized bones of large extinct animals could have inspired stories of titans and heroes slaying monstrous beasts. Greek naturalists like Herodotus and Pliny the Elder documented fossil findings, showing early attempts to explain these remains within a mythological and historical framework.
1193	This research paper examines the partonic structure of hadrons through the Drell-Yan process. The Drell-Yan process is a powerful tool to investigate the partonic structure of hadrons by measuring the production of lepton pairs in high-energy proton-proton collisions. The paper discusses the theoretical framework of the Drell-Yan process, including the parton distribution functions and their uncertainties. The experimental methods used to measure the Drell-Yan process are also presented. The results of recent experiments are discussed, including measurements of the parton distribution functions, their evolution, and the nucleon structure. Finally, the implications of these results for our understanding of the partonic structure of hadrons are discussed, including their relevance for the study of high-energy hadron collisions and the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.
2642	This research paper aims to investigate the time dependence of joint entropy of oscillating quantum systems. The joint entropy is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in a system, and understanding its behavior over time is crucial for analyzing complex quantum systems. The study will utilize mathematical models to simulate the behavior of oscillating quantum systems and examine how the joint entropy evolves over time. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of quantum information theory and help to shed light on the dynamics of complex quantum systems.
3154	In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main results in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.
310	"The paper titled ""Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB"" discusses the use of a combination of two wireless communication techniques, namely, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), for achieving high data rates in Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems. The paper proposes a novel UWB communication system that uses OFDM as the base modulation scheme and CDMA for spreading the data across different channels. The authors explain the benefits of using this combination, such as high spectral efficiency, improved data security, and low power consumption. They also present simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving high data rates. Overall, the paper concludes that the combination of OFDM and CDMA is a promising technique for achieving high data rates in UWB communication systems."
771	In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the Taylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.
1281	Using a generalisation of the detailed balance for systems maintained out of equilibrium by contact with 2 reservoirs at unequal temperatures or at unequal densities, we recover the fluctuation theorem for the large deviation funtion of the current. For large diffusive systems, we show how the large deviation funtion of the current can be computed using a simple additivity principle. The validity of this additivity principle and the occurence of phase transitions are discussed in the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.
D2-98	Plasticizers like phthalates were thought to be mainly hormone disruptors. They caused fertility problems and adverse developmental effects. Surprisingly, since the 2000s researchers noted that they were instrumental in causing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another key point, phthalates can be absorbed through the skin, ingested by mouth or inhaled. In order to understand how phthalates cause cardiovascular disease, we need to investigate the effects of phthalates on fatty tissue. Phthalates have a negative effect on fatty tissue that leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Fat cells develop out of adipose stem cells committing themselves and maturing into fatty cells that can store lipids. This process has the name adipogenesis.
294	This research paper presents a method for determining the frequency distribution function of supernova (SNe) explosions based on numerical simulations. The study finds that the SNe frequency distribution function can be approximated by a power law with an index of -1.9, which is consistent with previous observational studies. The simulations also show that the frequency of Type Ia SNe is higher than that of Type II SNe, which may have important implications for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Overall, the study provides new insights into the frequency distribution of SNe and highlights the importance of numerical simulations in astrophysical research.
D1-8	Thalidomide is a drug that was first developed in the 1950s as a sedative and later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. However, it caused severe birth defects, including missing or malformed limbs, when taken during pregnancy. The tragedy affected thousands of babies and led to stricter drug regulations worldwide. Despite its harmful past, thalidomide was later found to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Today, it is used under strict controls to treat multiple myeloma, leprosy-related inflammation, and some autoimmune diseases. Due to its risks, it is only prescribed under a controlled program to prevent use during pregnancy. Its history remains a major lesson in pharmaceutical safety.
1341	We examine the nature of large-scale, coronal, propagating wave fronts (``EIT waves'') and find they are incongruous with solutions using fast-mode MHD plane-wave theory. Specifically, we consider the following properties: non-dispersive single pulse manifestions, observed velocities below the local Alfven speed, and different pulses which travel at any number of constant velocities, rather than at the ``predicted'' fast-mode speed. We discuss the possibility of a soliton-like explanation for these phenomena, and show how it is consistent with the above-mentioned aspects.
1113	"The research paper titled ""Vers l'auto-administration des entrep ts de donn es"" (Towards self-administration of data warehouses) discusses the importance of automating the administration of data warehouses to improve their performance and reduce the workload of database administrators. The paper proposes a self-administration framework that can automatically detect and resolve performance issues in a data warehouse. The framework includes various modules for monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and optimization of the data warehouse system. The key findings of the paper suggest that self-administration of data warehouses can improve system performance, reduce manual intervention, and enable efficient use of resources. The paper concludes that the proposed framework can be used to develop a self-administration system for data warehouses, which can help organizations to manage their data more effectively and efficiently."
2930	This research paper investigates a massive runaway star from the Cygnus OB2 association, one of the most massive and youngest associations in the Milky Way. By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopic data, we explore the kinematics and chemical properties of the runaway star and compare them with those of other Cygnus OB2 members. Our results suggest that the runaway star was ejected from the association due to dynamical interactions with other massive stars. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the formation and evolution of massive stars and their impact on their surroundings. This research provides important insights into the dynamics and chemical evolution of young stellar associations and contributes to our understanding of the broader astrophysical context of massive stars.
1747	This research paper examines the possibility of multi-graviton theories in the presence of a Dirac field. The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to show that such theories are not viable. They find that the introduction of a Dirac field leads to the appearance of non-renormalizable operators that cannot be absorbed into the gravitational interactions. This ultimately leads to inconsistencies in the theory and the breakdown of perturbative calculations. The authors conclude that multi-graviton theories cannot be formulated in the presence of a Dirac field, which has important implications for efforts to unify gravity with other fundamental forces.
252	This research paper investigates the behavior of magneto-elastic waves in crystals of magnetic molecules. Through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, we identify the specific characteristics of these waves and their effect on the magnetic properties of the crystal. Our results reveal the crucial role of magneto-elastic coupling in the understanding of magnetic materials and provide insights into the potential applications of these waves in magneto-electronics and spintronics. Overall, this study highlights the significance of magneto-elastic waves in the field of condensed matter physics and serves as a vital step towards developing advanced magnetic materials and devices.
987	The paper focuses on modelling the energy dependencies of high-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in Black Hole X-ray Binaries. The study uses data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to analyze the energy dependence of QPOs in six different sources. The authors develop a model based on a combination of thermal Comptonization and propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations to explain the energy dependence of the observed QPOs. The study finds that the model successfully explains the observations for all six sources and provides insight into the physical mechanisms behind the observed QPOs. The authors conclude that the QPOs are likely caused by the interaction between the accretion flow and the black hole's strong gravity.
731	We numerically study the dynamical excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) placed in periodic and quasi-periodic 2D optical lattice (OL). In case of the repulsive mean-field interaction the BEC quantum tunnelling leads to a progressive soliton's splitting and generating of secondary solitons, which migrate to closest trapping potential minima. A nontrivial soliton dynamics appears when a series of pi-pulses (phase kicks) are applied to the optical lattice. Such sudden perturbation produces a dynamic redistribution of the secondary solitons, leading to a formation of an artificial solitonic superlattice. Different geometries of OL are analyzed.
354	This research paper presents a comparative study of the pair-creation contact process using series expansions. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of the process in different scenarios and to compare the results obtained using different expansion techniques. The study shows that the behavior of the pair-creation contact process is highly dependent on the parameters of the system and the expansion technique used. The outcomes of this study provide insights into the behavior of the pair-creation contact process and can be used to improve the understanding of similar processes in different systems. Overall, the results suggest that the use of series expansions can be an effective tool for studying the behavior of complex systems and can provide valuable insights into their dynamics.
2286	We propose and analyze a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimator for the atomistic-continuum modeling error in the quasicontinuum method. Based on this error estimator, we develop an algorithm which adaptively determines the atomistic and continuum regions to compute a quantity of interest to within a given tolerance. We apply the algorithm to the computation of the structure of a crystallographic defect described by a Frenkel-Kontorova model and present the results of numerical experiments. The numerical results show that our method gives an efficient estimate of the error and a nearly optimal atomistic-continuum modeling strategy.
3371	We consider a diffusion model with limit cycle reaction functions, in the presence of convection. We select a set of functions derived from a realistic reaction model: the Schnakenberg equations. This resultant form is unsymmetrical. We find a transformation which maps the irregular equations into model form. Next we transform the dependent variables into polar form. From here, a travelling wave analysis is performed on the radial variable. Results are complex, but we make some simple estimates. We carry out numerical experiments to test our analysis. An initial `knock' starts the propagation of pattern. The speed of the travelling wave is not quite as expected. We investigate further. The system demonstrates distinctly different behaviour to the left and the right. We explain how this phenomenon occurs by examining the underlying behaviour.
3742	This research paper presents an online repository of Swift/XRT light curves of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite. The primary focus is to provide an easily accessible and user-friendly database for the scientific community to study the temporal behavior of GRBs. The repository contains light curves of 582 GRBs observed by the Swift/XRT telescope from 2004 to 2019. The remarkable finding is that the repository allows for the analysis of the temporal behavior of GRBs in a systematic and efficient manner, leading to better understanding of the physics behind these high-energy phenomena. The conclusion is that the repository will be a valuable resource for future studies of GRBs.
1474	We study properties of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in the background of k NS5-branes, with one transverse direction compactified on a circle, from the point of view of Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We present the analysis of two different embedding of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in given background and study the classical solutions of given world-volume theory. We argue for the configuration of a non-BPS D(p+1)-brane which allows us to find solutions of the equations of motion that give unified descriptions of G and U-type branes.
1314	This research paper investigates the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the large-scale structure of the universe using numerical simulations. The study focuses on the impact of nonlinear gravitational interactions on the growth and evolution of BAOs and their influence on the cosmological parameter measurements. The main findings of the paper reveal that the nonlinear evolution of BAOs leads to a significant damping of the acoustic peaks which can affect the accuracy of cosmological parameter measurements. The study also highlights the importance of accounting for nonlinear effects when interpreting observational data. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the nonlinear evolution of BAOs and their impact on cosmological parameter measurements.
70	This research paper presents a generic test for modified gravity models that emulate dark matter. The study focuses on the galactic dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and utilizes the Jeans equation to derive the velocity dispersion profiles. The authors compare the predictions of modified gravity models to those of dark matter models and find that some modified gravity models can accurately reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profiles without the need for dark matter. However, the study also highlights the limitations of the generic test and emphasizes the need for further testing and refinement of modified gravity models. The results suggest that modified gravity models have the potential to provide an alternative explanation for the observed galactic dynamics, but more research is needed to fully understand their implications.
423	In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry. We also consider possible improvements to existing text entry evaluation metrics, such as the minimum string distance error rate, keystrokes per character, cost per correction, and a unified approach proposed by MacKenzie, so they can accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese text. Current methods lack an integrated concern about both typing speed and accuracy for Chinese text entry evaluation. Our goal is to remove the bias that arises due to human factors. First, we propose a new metric, called the correction penalty (P), based on Fitts' law and Hick's law. Next, we transform it into the approximate amortized cost (AAC) of information theory. An analysis of the AAC of Chinese text input methods with different context lengths is also presented.
523	In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of accelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of space-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe. This interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some experimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated expansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale.
82	This research paper focuses on the numerical extraction of metrics in the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical framework that relates two seemingly different physical theories - gravity in a spacetime called Anti-de Sitter space and a quantum field theory on the boundary of that spacetime. The paper presents a new numerical method to extract the metric in AdS/CFT and applies it to a specific example. The results show that the method is effective and can provide valuable insights into the AdS/CFT correspondence. The research concludes that this numerical approach can be applied to other scenarios in AdS/CFT and can be useful in understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory.
2654	We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately, sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another ``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.
1606	Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T Tauri Stars (TTS) are still not well understood. Important new insight came recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a unique 10-day long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST). Based mainly on the results of these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.
83	We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic factors, such as country wealth and foreign investment per capita, which are characterized by a power law spanning multiple scales of wealth and investments per capita. These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable over different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between level of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for two independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption. The functional relations we report have implications when assessing the relative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for quantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign investments.
1295	A structure with a massive group in its center and a cool expansion outflow outside is studied around the Cen A galaxy with the use of the Hubble Space Telescope observations. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the flow is dominated by the antigravity of the dark energy background. The density of dark energy in the cell is estimated to be near the global cosmological density. This agrees with our previous result from the neighborhood of the Local group. A notion of the ``Hubble cell'' is introduced as a building block of the local structure of the universe.
3208	This research paper investigates the particle number requirements for simulating bar-halo friction in galaxies. Bar-halo friction is a phenomenon in which the bar structure of a galaxy interacts with its dark matter halo, causing the rotation of the bar to slow down. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the effects of varying the number of particles in the simulation on the accuracy of the results. The results of the study suggest that a higher number of particles in the simulation is required to accurately capture the effects of bar-halo friction, particularly in galaxies with a low-mass halo. These findings have implications for future simulations of galaxy evolution and provide insight into the complex interactions between the various components of galaxies.
3572	The objective of this research paper is to study the uniqueness domains of parallel manipulators in their workspace. The paper first defines the concept of uniqueness domains and presents a method to compute them for different types of parallel manipulators. The study then investigates the impact of design parameters, such as link lengths and joint angles, on the size and shape of the uniqueness domains. Key results indicate that the size and shape of the uniqueness domains vary significantly with changes in the design parameters. The paper also highlights the importance of uniqueness domains in the design and control of parallel manipulators. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of parallel manipulators and can aid in the optimization of their design for specific applications.
2915	A theory of collective states in a magnetically quantized two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with half-filled Landau level (quantized Hall ferromagnet) in the presence of magnetic 3d impurities is developed. The spectrum of bound and delocalized spin-excitons as well as the renormalization of Zeeman splitting of the impurity 3d levels due to the indirect exchange interaction with the 2DEG are studied for the specific case of n-type GaAs doped with Mn where the Lande` g-factors of impurity and 2DEG have opposite signs. If the sign of the 2DEG g-factor is changed due to external influences, then impurity related transitions to new ground state phases, presenting various spin-flip and skyrmion-like textures, are possible. Conditions for existence of these phases are discussed. PACS: 73.43.Lp, 73.21.Fg, 72.15.Rn
983	This research paper investigates the effect of selection on ancestry using an exactly soluble case and its phenomenological generalization. The study shows that selection can have a significant impact on the distribution of ancestry in a population, leading to changes in genetic diversity and the frequencies of different alleles. The results suggest that selection should be taken into account when studying the population genetics of complex traits. Overall, this research provides a better understanding of the relationship between selection and ancestry and its implications for evolutionary biology.
1992	This research paper focuses on improving the actions and asymptotic scaling in lattice Yang-Mills theory. The study utilizes a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the relationship between the lattice spacing and the energy of the system. The results indicate that by introducing a new discretization scheme, the asymptotic scaling can be improved, leading to a more accurate description of the system's behavior at large distances. The research also identifies critical outcomes, including the importance of considering higher-order terms in the action and the need to account for finite volume effects. The conclusions highlight the potential of the proposed approach to enhance the understanding of the behavior of gauge theories and contribute to the development of efficient numerical simulations.
3372	This research paper explores the phenomenon of limit cycles in the presence of convection and utilizes a travelling wave analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms. Limit cycles are oscillations that occur in dynamical systems and have important applications in various fields, including physics and biology. Convection, which arises due to temperature differences, can significantly affect the behavior of limit cycles. The paper proposes a mathematical model to describe the interplay between limit cycles and convection and investigates the resulting dynamics. The travelling wave analysis provides insight into the spatiotemporal behavior of the system and reveals important features such as bifurcations and stability. The results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of limit cycles in complex systems and have implications for the design of control strategies in practical applications.
2433	"The research paper titled ""Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at irrational frustration"" investigates the behavior of Josephson-junction arrays at zero temperature and irrational frustration. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the resistive transition in the arrays and observe the role of irrational frustration in the process. The main findings of the study suggest that the resistive transition occurs at a critical value of frustration and the transition becomes sharper as the frustration becomes more irrational. The study also shows that the critical behavior of the transition is governed by the renormalization group fixed point, which is determined by the degree of irrationality of the frustration. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behavior of Josephson-junction arrays and could lead to the development of new types of superconducting devices."
3685	This research paper investigates the process of potassium intercalation in graphite using a van der Waals density-functional approach. The study examines the effects of various parameters, including the concentration and orientation of potassium atoms, on the intercalation process. The results indicate that the intercalation process is highly dependent on the orientation of the potassium atoms and the concentration of the intercalant. The study concludes that the van der Waals density-functional approach is an effective method for simulating the intercalation process in graphite and provides valuable insights into the behavior of intercalants in layered materials. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the intercalation process and has potential applications in the development of new materials for energy storage and other advanced technologies.
2323	"We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation, based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The temperature in such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation of vortex motion in superfluids."
515	Skew critical problems occur in continuous and discrete nonholonomic Lagrangian systems. They are analogues of constrained optimization problems, where the objective is differentiated in directions given by an apriori distribution, instead of tangent directions to the constraint. We show semiglobal existence and uniqueness for nondegenerate skew critical problems, and show that the solutions of two skew critical problems have the same contact as the problems themselves. Also, we develop some infrastructure that is necessary to compute with contact order geometrically, directly on manifolds.
2024	This research paper examines the mathematical model of fluid dynamics known as the Navier-Stokes equations and its application to turbulent flows. The paper investigates the fundamental properties of turbulence and its impact on the Navier-Stokes equations. The study reveals that while the Navier-Stokes equations provide a robust framework for modeling fluid dynamics, turbulence remains a challenging and unsolved problem. The paper concludes by highlighting the critical need for further research to advance our understanding of turbulence and its impact on fluid dynamics.
1541	"The paper titled ""Influence of Orbital Behaviour and Chaos on the Shape of Dark Matter Halos"" explores the effect of chaotic orbits on the shape of dark matter halos. The study uses computer simulations to model the behavior of dark matter particles in halos and investigates the impact of chaotic motion on the shape of the halo. The researchers found that the chaotic orbits of dark matter particles can significantly alter the shape of the halo, causing it to become more elongated and distorted. This conclusion has important implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of galaxies, as dark matter halos play a crucial role in shaping the distribution of visible matter. The study also highlights the need for further research to better understand the complex dynamics of dark matter particles and their impact on galactic structure."
802	This research paper investigates the contact process in binary two-dimensional lattices, both disordered and periodic. The study explores the critical behavior of the contact process in these lattices and identifies the presence of a phase transition. Through numerical simulations and analysis, the research reveals that the critical behavior of the contact process is markedly different in periodic and disordered lattices. Additionally, the study identifies the critical exponents that govern the phase transition and highlights the impact of the initial infection density on the process's dynamics. These findings have implications for understanding the spread of infectious diseases and other phenomena that depend on the contact process.
3634	This research paper investigates the regions of feasible point-to-point trajectories in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators. The study aims to identify the geometric constraints that restrict the end-effector's motion and determine the feasible regions of motion. The research employs mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to develop a methodology for analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the manipulator's geometry in determining the feasible regions of motion and provide insights into the design of parallel manipulators for optimal performance. The research concludes that the proposed methodology is effective in analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators and can be used in the design and optimization of these systems.
1997	Infrared-Faint Radio Sources represent a new and unexpected class of object which is bright at radio wavelengths but unusually faint at infrared wavelengths. If, like most mJy radio sources, they were either conventional active or star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, we would expect them to be detectable at infrared wavelengths, and so their non-detection by the Spitzer Space Telescope is surprising. Here we report the detection of one of these sources using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, from which we conclude that the sources are driven by Active Galactic Nuclei. We suggest that these sources are either normal radio-loud quasars at high redshift or abnormally obscured radio galaxies.
3092	A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).
912	Consider a collection of random variables attached to the vertices of a graph. The reconstruction problem requires to estimate one of them given `far away' observations. Several theoretical results (and simple algorithms) are available when their joint probability distribution is Markov with respect to a tree. In this paper we consider the case of sequences of random graphs that converge locally to trees. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for the tree and graph reconstruction problem to coincide. We apply such condition to colorings of random graphs. Further, we characterize the behavior of Ising models on such graphs, both with attractive and random interactions (respectively, `ferromagnetic' and `spin glass').
3183	"The research paper titled ""SBF: multi-wavelength data and models"" presents a study on the surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) of galaxies, which can be used to determine their distances. The authors use multi-wavelength data from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes to model the SBF in different bands and compare the results to theoretical predictions. They find that the models agree well with the data, suggesting that SBF can be a reliable distance indicator for galaxies. The paper also discusses the potential applications of SBF in cosmology and galaxy evolution studies."
2680	We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems: 1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative, with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.

We consider two cases, depending on whether or not the family contains the empty set. We also provide algorithms for efficiently testing these conditions, and for augmenting a set family in a minimal way to one that satisfies these conditions.

1831	We propose a technique aimed at cooling a harmonically oscillating mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state starting from room temperature. Our method, which involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside an optical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangements being used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping, and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed mostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are expected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror closer to completion.

They find that these correlators exhibit fractional statistics, meaning that the particles behave as if they have a fractionally charged or fractional spin. The paper's crucial conclusion is that this fractional behavior arises from the topological properties of the system, rather than the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the exotic behavior of particles in the quantum Hall effect and sheds light on the fundamental properties of matter."
1628	We show that condensation in a capped capillary slit is a continuous interfacial critical phenomenon, related intimately to several other surface phase transitions. In three dimensions (3d), the adsorption and desorption branches correspond to the unbinding of the meniscus from the cap and opening, respectively and are equivalent to 2d-like complete-wetting transitions. For dispersion forces, the singularities on the two branches are distinct, owing to the different interplay of geometry and intermolecular forces. In 2d we establish precise connection, or covariance, with 2d critical-wetting and wedge-filling transitions, i.e. we establish that certain interfacial properties in very different geometries are identical. Our predictions of universal scaling and covariance in finite capillaries are supported by extensive Ising model simulation studies in 2d and 3d.
2251	This research paper explores the statistical properties of many-particle eigenfunctions in a variety of physical systems. The primary focus is on understanding the behavior of these eigenfunctions and their relationship to the underlying physical properties of the system. The paper presents several key findings, including the observation that many-particle eigenfunctions tend to be highly complex and exhibit a wide range of statistical properties. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of understanding these properties in order to better predict the behavior of physical systems at the quantum level. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the statistical properties of many-particle eigenfunctions and their role in understanding complex physical systems.
D2-67	The Lavoisier Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, was formulated by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. This law states that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products during a chemical reaction. In simpler terms, matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it only transforms from one form to another. This fundamental principle revolutionized chemistry, as it emphasized the importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding the fate of matter in reactions. The law laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory and remains a cornerstone of scientific understanding.
2942	Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered. Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength, spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of a monochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and the amplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case of a linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibility of experimental observation of the process is discussed.
1112	With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator must perform manually. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for some years. However, little research has been achieved. The aim of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent itemsets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.
2187	This research paper delves into the regularity properties of separable amenable C*-algebras in the classification program. The study focuses on identifying and characterizing certain regularity properties in these algebras that play a crucial role in the classification process. The research highlights the significance of these properties in the development of a unified classification theory for C*-algebras. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and utilizing these regularity properties in the classification program for separable amenable C*-algebras. Overall, this study sheds light on a crucial aspect of C*-algebra classification and provides valuable insights into the subject.
3950	The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the torque.
143	We show that a quantum state may be represented as the sum of a joint probability and a complex quantum modification term. The joint probability and the modification term can both be observed in successive projective measurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurement disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part. This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as a nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significance of the Schwinger basis.
537	We study Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a two-band boson Hubbard model, which can be mapped onto a spin-1/2 XY model with spins coupled to an additional Ising degree of freedom. By using a modified mean field theory that include the effects of phase fluctuations, we show that the transition is first order at both zero and finite temperatures. On the Mott insulator side, there may be reentrance in phase transition. These features are consequences of the underlying transition between competing defect poor and defect rich phases. The relevance of the model and our results to supersolid 4He and cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices are discussed.
1426	This research paper explores the concept of recursive weighted treelike networks, which are a type of hierarchical network structure. The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential benefits of using recursive weighted treelike networks in various applications, including social networks, transportation systems, and biological networks. The research presents a framework for constructing these networks and evaluates their performance based on several metrics, such as efficiency, robustness, and scalability. The results show that recursive weighted treelike networks can offer significant advantages over other network structures, particularly in terms of reducing communication and transportation costs and improving network resilience. The study concludes that recursive weighted treelike networks have the potential to be a valuable tool for designing and optimizing complex systems in a wide range of fields.
1630	We have recorded fluorescence spectra of the atomic rubidium D-lines in the presence of several hundreds of bars buffer gas pressure. With additional saturation broadening a spectral linewidth comparable to the thermal energy of the atoms in the heated gas cell is achieved. An intensity-dependent blue asymmetry of the spectra is observed, which becomes increasingly pronounced when extrapolating to infinitely high light intensity. We interpret our results as evidence for the dressed (coupled atom-light) states to approach thermal equilibrium.
1760	A ToO observation of the TeV-emitting blazar Mrk 421 with INTEGRAL was triggered in June 2006 by an increase of the RXTE count rate to more than 30 mCrab. The source was then observed with all INTEGRAL instruments with the exception of the spectrometer SPI for a total exposure of 829 ks. During this time several outbursts were observed by IBIS and JEM-X. Multiwavelength observations were immediately triggered and the source was observed at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths up to TeV energies. The data obtained during these observations are analysed with respect to spectral evolution and correlated variability. Preliminary results of the analysis are presented in this poster.
3442	The article discusses the monitoring of the neutron star 4U 1636-53 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. The study focuses on the long-term evolution of the system and the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in its X-ray emission. The authors analyze the data from RXTE observations spanning over a decade and conclude that the system's X-ray flux and kHz QPO properties undergo significant changes over time. They also suggest that the kHz QPOs might be associated with the accretion flow around the neutron star, and their evolution could provide insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring of X-ray binaries to understand their complex behavior and dynamics.
1280	This research paper explores the use of heavy-tailed distributions in the training of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using the UCI Thyroid Disease Database as a case study. The study shows that the use of heavy-tailed distributions can significantly reduce the training time of MLPs while maintaining or improving the accuracy of the model. The study also demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting the hyperparameters of the MLPs to achieve optimal performance. Overall, the findings suggest that heavy-tailed distributions can be an effective tool for improving the efficiency of MLP training.
1026	We study the possibility of obtaining large nongaussian signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background in a general class of single-field nonlocal hill-top inflation models. We estimate the nonlinearity parameter f_{NL} which characterizes nongaussianity in such models and show that large nongaussianity is possible. For the recently proposed p-adic inflation model we find that f_{NL} ~ 120 when the string coupling is order unity. We show that large nongaussianity is also possible in a toy model with an action similar to those which arise in string field theory.
1885	"The research paper titled ""Magnetic Coupling and Long-Range Order in the Spin-Chain Sulphide Ba2cos3"" investigates the magnetic properties of Ba2cos3, a spin-chain sulphide. The study employs various techniques such as magnetometry, neutron diffraction, and muon spin relaxation to investigate the magnetic behavior of the compound. The results indicate that the magnetic coupling in Ba2cos3 is predominantly one-dimensional, and the compound exhibits long-range magnetic order. The study also suggests that the magnetic interaction between the chains is weak, resulting in the absence of three-dimensional magnetic ordering. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the magnetic behavior of spin-chain materials and can aid in the design of future magnetic materials with tailored properties."
342	This research paper examines the phenomenon of multiple random walks being faster than a single random walk. Using mathematical models and simulations, we demonstrate that in certain scenarios, multiple walkers can reach their target faster than a single walker. Our findings suggest that this phenomenon is applicable in various fields, including biology, physics, and computer science. We also discuss the implications of our research for optimizing search algorithms and improving efficiency in various real-world applications. Overall, our study sheds light on the importance of considering the role of multiple actors in complex systems and highlights the potential benefits of collaboration and coordination.
3296	The aim of this research paper is to investigate the bond formation and slow heterogeneous dynamics in adhesive spheres with long-ranged repulsion. We present a quantitative test of Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) to understand the dynamic behavior of these systems. Our results demonstrate that MCT is capable of predicting the slow dynamics observed in these systems, particularly the dynamics of bond formation and the formation of glassy structures. Moreover, our findings indicate that the long-range repulsion significantly affects the dynamics, leading to a more complex behavior. Our study provides insights into the fundamental understanding of the dynamic behavior of adhesive spheres and highlights the importance of considering long-range interactions in predicting their behavior.
2763	A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and dissipated in the outer solar layers. Progress in this field has been slow and painstaking. However, advances in computer hardware and numerical methods, vastly increased observational capabilities and growing physical insight seem finally to be leading towards understanding. Here we present exploratory numerical MHD models that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE radiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin radiative losses as well as magnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the transition region and corona.
3755	Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.
3822	This research paper explores the dynamics of two-field inflation, specifically focusing on the effects of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We investigate the interplay between these perturbations during the early universe and their impact on the cosmic microwave background radiation. By analyzing different inflationary models, we find that the relative importance of curvature and isocurvature perturbations depends on the specific parameters of the model, such as the initial conditions and the mass ratio of the two fields. Our results shed light on the theoretical and observational implications of two-field inflation and provide valuable insights for future cosmological studies.
2663	"The research paper titled ""Path integrals for stiff polymers applied to membrane physics"" aimed to develop a new method for simulating the behavior of stiff polymers in biological membranes. The researchers utilized a mathematical technique known as path integrals to model the movement of these polymers, which are critical components of cell membranes. The study found that the path integral approach allowed for more accurate modeling of the behavior of stiff polymers in membranes compared to previous methods. This led to new insights into the role of these polymers in membrane structure and function, which could have implications for understanding disease states such as cancer. Overall, the research paper demonstrates the potential of path integrals as a powerful tool for studying the complex physics of biological membranes and the polymers that make them up."
906	"The detection and estimation of signals in noisy, limited data is a problem of interest to many scientific and engineering communities. We present a computationally simple, sample eigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise when there are relatively few samples. We highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based detection of weak high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size and discuss its implication for the detection of two closely spaced signals. This motivates our heuristic definition of the 'effective number of identifiable signals.' Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the consistency of the algorithm with respect to the effective number of signals and the superior performance of the algorithm with respect to Wax and Kailath's ""asymptotically consistent"" MDL based estimator."
D2-50	The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly destroying Earth as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun.
2125	We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound state in cosmic string background may lead to the so called anomalous scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular physics.
1075	In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.
2783	The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction [ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy. Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate for the high-density electron gas.
1582	Here we present a problem related to the local Hamiltonian problem (identifying whether the ground state energy falls within one of two ranges) which is restricted to being translationally invariant. We prove that for problems with a fixed local dimension and O(\log(N))-body local terms, or local dimension N and 2-body terms, there are instances of the problem which are QMA-complete. We discuss the implications for the computational complexity of finding ground states of these systems, and hence for any classical approximation techniques that one could apply including DMRG, Matrix Product States and MERA. One important example is a 1D lattice of bosons with nearest-neighbor hopping at constant filling fraction i.e. a generalization of the Bose-Hubbard model.
570	We performed a visualization of membrane proteins labeled with 10-nm gold nanoparticles in cells, using an all-optical method based on photothermal interference contrast. The high sensitivity of the method and the stability of the signals allows 3D imaging of individual nanoparticles without the drawbacks of photobleaching and blinking inherent to fluorescent markers. A simple analytical model is derived to account for the measurements of the signal amplitude and the spatial resolution. The photothermal interference contrast method provides an efficient, reproducible, and promising way to visualize low amounts of proteins in cells by optical means.
730	This research paper explores non-Abelian plasma instabilities in two spatial dimensions and draws lessons from them. The study shows how these instabilities can lead to the formation of complex structures in the plasma, such as magnetic vortices and filaments. The findings suggest that these instabilities can play a crucial role in the dynamics of non-Abelian plasmas, and can have implications for a range of fields, including astrophysics and fusion energy research. Ultimately, the paper highlights the importance of further research into non-Abelian plasma instabilities to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of these complex systems.
85	In this article we calculate the electrical conductivity in QED using the 2PI effective action. We use a modified version of the usual 2PI effective action which is defined with respect to self-consistent solutions of the 2-point functions. We show that the green functions obtained from this modified effective action satisfy ward identities and that the conductivity obtained from the kubo relation is gauge invariant. We work to 3-loop order in the modified 2PI effective action and show explicitly that the resulting expression for the conductivity contains the square of the amplitude that corresponds to all binary collision and production processes.
3205	"We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise."
1750	The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth was studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature stage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy concentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal and vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged defects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations necessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot cooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine concentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the high-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities were obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the postgrowth annealing of the ingot.
1174	In cuprate superconductors doping is believed to create holes on the O-sites, which couple antiferromagnetically with holes on the Cu-sites to form the so-called Zhang-Rice singlets. Here we study a d-wave pairing state based on the Zhang-Rice singlet states. Upper and lower bounds of an off-diagonal long-range order parameter with d-wave symmetry for this state are estimated. We also introduce a concrete model with on-site Coulomb repulsion and kinds of antiferromagnetic interactions whose ground state is this d-wave pairing state.
1671	Long, cylindrical metal nanowires have recently been observed to form and be stable for seconds at a time at room temperature. Their stability and structural dynamics is well described by a continuum model, the nanoscale free-electron model, which predicts cylinders in certain intervals of radius to be linearly unstable. In this paper, I study how a small, localized perturbation of such an unstable wire grows exponentially and propagates along the wire with a well-defined front. The front is found to be pulled, and forms a coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal stability analysis of front propagation into an unstable state. In some cases, nonlinearities of the wire dynamics are found to trigger an invasive mode that pushes the front. Experimental procedures that could lead to the observation of this phenomenon are suggested.
3683	"The research paper ""Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries"" focuses on the study of quantum field theory on curved backgrounds and its relationship with spacetime symmetries. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the different types of symmetries that can exist in a curved spacetime and their impact on the quantum field theory. The authors explore the effect of global and local symmetries on the renormalization of the theory and the existence of conserved currents. The significance of the findings is that they provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between symmetries and quantum field theory on curved backgrounds, which can have implications for the development of new theories in modern physics. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of further research in this area to fully understand the complexities of quantum field theory on curved backgrounds."
2593	This research paper focuses on the projective Hilbert space structures that occur at exceptional points, which are points in a system where two or more eigenvalues coalesce. The paper investigates the properties of these structures and their relationship to the topology of the parameter space. The primary outcome of the study is the identification of a topological invariant that characterizes the projective Hilbert space structures at exceptional points. The paper also highlights the potential applications of these structures in the field of quantum mechanics.
2543	We study the unfolding of a single polymer chain due to an external force. We use a simplified model which allows to perform all calculations in closed form without assuming a Boltzmann-Gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution. Temperature is then defined by calculating the Legendre transform of the entropy under certain constraints. The application of the model is limited to flexible polymers. It exhibits a gradual transition from compact globule to rod. The boundary line between these two phases shows reentrant behavior. This behavior is explained by the presence of residual entropy.
687	"Efficient injection of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band of silicon is limited by the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal (FM)/silicon interface. In the present work, this ""magnetically-dead"" silicide (where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization) is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junction base anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. This results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency, from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimated spin polarization in Si from ~1% to at least ~15%. The injector tunnel-junction bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization."
1616	Electronic properties of bilayer and multilayer graphene have generally been interpreted in terms of AB or Bernal stacking. However, it is known that many types of stacking defects can occur in natural and synthetic graphite; rotation of the top layer is often seen in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of graphite. In this paper we consider a graphene bilayer with a relative small angle rotation between the layers and calculate the electronic structure near zero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a AB stacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find: (a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermi velocity can be significantly smaller than the single layer value; (b) an external electric field, perpendicular to the layers, does not open an electronic gap
31	An experimental demonstration of a novel all-optical technique for loading ion traps, that has particular application to microtrap architectures, is presented. The technique is based on photo-ionisation of an atomic beam created by pulsed laser ablation of a calcium target, and provides improved temporal control compared to traditional trap loading methods. Ion loading rates as high as 125 ions per second have so far been observed. Also described are observations of trap loading where Rydberg state atoms are photo-ionised by the ion Doppler cooling laser.
1535	This research paper explores the relationship between quantum mechanics and closed timelike curves (CTCs). It delves into the theoretical framework of CTCs and their implications for the consistency of causality in quantum mechanics. The paper also examines the potential for using CTCs as a tool for quantum computation and communication. Ultimately, the research concludes that while CTCs provide interesting theoretical possibilities, they are unlikely to occur in reality and should not be relied upon for practical applications in quantum mechanics.
2839	We study characteristics of superpositions and entanglement of thermal states at high temperatures and discuss their applications to quantum information processing. We introduce thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states, which are a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures. A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell states without photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactions and two single-photon detectors. This enables one to perform quantum teleportation and gate operations for quantum computation with thermal-state qubits.
873	"The research paper titled ""Quantum Hacking: Experimental demonstration of time-shift attack against practical quantum key distribution systems"" explores the vulnerability of quantum key distribution systems to time-shift attacks. The paper presents experimental results that show how an attacker can exploit timing errors to gain unauthorized access to quantum keys. The study reveals that practical quantum key distribution systems are susceptible to time-shift attacks, and the security of these systems must be improved to prevent such attacks. The paper concludes that quantum cryptography protocols must be designed with robust timing mechanisms to prevent time-shift attacks and ensure the security of quantum keys."
2211	"The research paper titled ""ALHEP symbolic algebra program for high-energy physics"" focuses on the development and implementation of a symbolic algebra program for high-energy physics calculations. The program, called ALHEP, is designed to simplify complex mathematical expressions that arise in high-energy physics calculations. The paper describes the features and capabilities of the ALHEP program, including its ability to handle a wide range of mathematical expressions, perform algebraic manipulations, and generate code for Monte Carlo simulations. The paper also presents several examples of how ALHEP can be used in high-energy physics calculations, including calculations of cross-sections and decay rates. The main conclusion of the paper is that ALHEP is a powerful tool for simplifying and automating high-energy physics calculations, and that it has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of these calculations."
1956	"The research paper titled ""Adiabatic quantum pumping at the Josephson frequency"" presents a theoretical analysis of the adiabatic quantum pumping of Cooper pairs in a superconducting circuit. The study focuses on the Josephson frequency and its effect on the pumping process. The research findings suggest that the Josephson frequency plays a crucial role in the quantum pumping of Cooper pairs, and the pumping efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing the frequency. The study provides important insights into the fundamental aspects of adiabatic quantum pumping and its potential applications in quantum devices."
3976	Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
D1-24	Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on the planet, supporting millions of marine species and providing essential services like coastal protection and livelihoods for humans. However, their health is rapidly declining due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for energy, often leading to mass die-offs. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons, further threatening reef stability. The future of coral reefs depends on urgent conservation efforts. Strategies like reducing carbon emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and coral restoration projects (e.g., coral farming) offer hope. Research into resilient coral species and reef rehabilitation techniques is also promising.
2264	We show that when coherent-state encoding is employed in conjunction with coherent detection, the Bosonic broadcast channel is equivalent to a classical degraded Gaussian broadcast channel whose capacity region is dual to that of the classical Gaussian multiple-access channel. We further show that if a minimum output-entropy conjecture holds true, then the ultimate classical information capacity of the Bosonic broadcast channel can be achieved by a coherent-state encoding. We provide some evidence in support of the conjecture.
40	This research paper presents the scientific case and prospects for large underground, liquid-based detectors for astro-particle physics in Europe. The paper discusses the potential for these detectors to make groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of neutrino and dark matter research, as well as their ability to contribute to the study of supernovae, solar neutrinos, and geoneutrinos. The authors conclude that these detectors are crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe and recommend continued investment in their development and operation.
1069	The estimation of missing input vector elements in real time processing applications requires a system that possesses the knowledge of certain characteristics such as correlations between variables, which are inherent in the input space. Computational intelligence techniques and maximum likelihood techniques do possess such characteristics and as a result are important for imputation of missing data. This paper compares two approaches to the problem of missing data estimation. The first technique is based on the current state of the art approach to this problem, that being the use of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Expectation Maximisation (EM. The second approach is the use of a system based on auto-associative neural networks and the Genetic Algorithm as discussed by Adbella and Marwala3. The estimation ability of both of these techniques is compared, based on three datasets and conclusions are made.
1131	We show that the centrality and system-size dependence of elliptic flow measured at RHIC are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization. We argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25% below the (ideal) ``hydrodynamic limit'', even for the most central Au-Au collisions. This lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio. We also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data, in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound.
2158	We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo.
3091	Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) is a theoretical framework that proposes the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions in a higher dimensional space. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are two experimental facilities that can test GHU predictions and shed light on the nature of the Higgs boson and the origin of mass. In this research paper, we review recent developments in GHU and discuss their implications for LHC and ILC searches, including the possibility of discovering new particles and interactions. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of GHU and the importance of precision measurements to distinguish between different scenarios. Our analysis suggests that GHU can provide a compelling explanation for the hierarchy problem and offer new avenues for exploring the fundamental nature of the universe.
452	This research paper investigates the flow instabilities of magnetic flux tubes, focusing on longitudinal flow. In particular, we explore the effects of various parameters, such as the magnetic field strength and plasma density, on the development and behavior of these instabilities.

594	This Letter reports on the detection of two super-Earth planets in the Gl581 system, already known to harbour a hot Neptune. One of the planets has a mass of 5 M_Earth and resides at the ``warm'' edge of the habitable zone of the star. It is thus the known exoplanet which most resembles our own Earth. The other planet has a 7.7 M_Earth mass and orbits at 0.25 AU from the star, close to the ``cold'' edge of the habitable zone. These two new light planets around an M3 dwarf further confirm the formerly tentative statistical trend for i) many more very low-mass planets being found around M dwarfs than around solar-type stars and ii) low-mass planets outnumbering Jovian planets around M dwarfs.

Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.

Alternatively, the decay of the inverse population of spin levels can generate ultrasound. Possibility of solitary waves of the magnetization accompanied by the elastic twists is demonstrated.

The intriguing property of Sr2CrOsO6 is that it is at the endpoint of a metal-insulator transition due to 5d band filling, and at the same time ferrimagnetism and high-spin polarization is preserved.

3069	We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.
904	Link homotopy has been an active area of research for knot theorists since its introduction by Milnor in the 1950s. We introduce a new equivalence relation on spatial graphs called component homotopy, which reduces to link homotopy in the classical case. Unlike previous attempts at generalizing link homotopy to spatial graphs, our new relation allows analogues of some standard link homotopy results and invariants. In particular we can define a type of Milnor group for a spatial graph under component homotopy, and this group determines whether or not the spatial graph is splittable. More surprisingly, we will also show that whether the spatial graph is splittable up to component homotopy depends only on the link homotopy class of the links contained within it. Numerical invariants of the relation will also be produced.

The results demonstrate that wind-driven shocks likely play a key role in the outburst of RS Ophiuchi, and that further studies of such shocks could lead to a better understanding of the physics of novae. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the Swift satellite is a valuable tool for studying novae and other astrophysical phenomena.

2702	Molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation are performed for two extreme cases of complex metallic alloys (CMAs): In a model quasicrystal the structure is determined by clusters of atoms, whereas the model C15 Laves phase is a simple periodic stacking of a unit cell. The simulations reveal that the basic building units of the structures also govern their fracture behaviour. Atoms in the Laves phase play a comparable role to the clusters in the quasicrystal. Although the latter are not rigid units, they have to be regarded as significant physical entities.

The findings suggest that LBV mass loss can lead to quasi-periodic modulations in the radio emission from supernovae, providing insight into the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena. The research concludes that further studies of LBV mass loss and its effects on supernovae are necessary to fully understand the processes that lead to these events.
D1-14	Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept that matter is conserved during a reaction, meaning the quantity of reactants used equals the quantity of products formed. Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the molar ratios between substances, allowing the calculation of how much of each reactant is needed and how much product will be formed. This includes conversions between moles, mass, and volume. Stoichiometric calculations are essential for understanding reaction yields, determining the limiting reactant, and ensuring efficient use of materials in chemical processes.

Our results also suggest that the re-acceleration model can explain the observed properties of radio halos in galaxy clusters. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters.

The proposed model is able to combine the accuracy of the Bayesian MLP model and the transparency of Bayesian rough set model.
1729	The Casimir effect is a well-known phenomenon in quantum field theory that arises due to the presence of boundary conditions in the vacuum energy of a system. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the Casimir effect on nontrivial topology spaces, particularly in the context of Krein space quantization. In this research paper, we investigate the Casimir effect on a nontrivial topology space, namely the torus, in the framework of Krein space quantization. We derive the Casimir energy density and investigate its dependence on the geometry and topology of the torus. Our results show that the Casimir energy density exhibits nontrivial behavior as a function of the torus parameters, indicating the potential for using the Casimir effect as a tool to probe the topology of nontrivial spaces in Krein space quantization.
353	A comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for the pair-creation contact process is presented. In contrast to the ordinary contact process, whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation is added to the pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical series expansions which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process. Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations.

1590	This research paper investigates the Cosmological Casimir effect in an accelerating universe with a maximum Planckian momentum. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations are used to study the impact of the acceleration on the Casimir effect and its behavior at maximum Planckian momentum. Results indicate that the acceleration modifies the Casimir effect, causing a shift in the vacuum energy density and a change in the critical distance at which the effect becomes dominant. Furthermore, the maximum Planckian momentum affects the Casimir effect, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the effect at high momenta. The study's findings have implications for understanding the behavior of quantum fields in the early universe and the impact of acceleration on these fields.

The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.

The authors demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several molecular systems and conclude that the BEP principle can provide a valuable tool for accelerating global optimization algorithms in computational chemistry.
D1-9	Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery. In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.

We point out some open problems regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may be tackled by means of such extensions.
D2-60	The dangers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, stem from their persistence in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate in living organisms. Known as 'forever chemicals,' PFAS do not break down easily, leading to long-term environmental contamination. They are found in products like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and water-repellent textiles. PFAS can enter the human body through contaminated drinking water and food, particularly in areas near industrial sites. Prolonged exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including certain cancers, hormonal disruptions, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, PFAS contribute to ecosystem harm by affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Their long-lasting nature makes them a significant environmental and public health concern, as they are challenging to eliminate.

Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we analyze the surface brightness profiles of a sample of elliptical galaxies and compare them to theoretical predictions for density profiles of collisionless, dissipationless systems. We find that the observed density profiles are consistent with these predictions, suggesting that local ellipticals may indeed be violently relaxed systems. This has implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies, as well as for the broader field of galaxy formation and evolution.
2694	We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of the standard field-theoretical treatment of vacuum energy and discuss the relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous symmetry breaking. We suggest possible extensions of the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis symmetry, in particular, its complexification till duality symmetry and discuss the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be responsible for a small observable value of this constant.

3857	This research paper presents a study on modeling the three-point correlation function (TPCF) of galaxies in the universe. The TPCF is a statistical measure that describes the clustering of galaxies in three dimensions. We explore different approaches for modeling the TPCF, including analytical models and numerical simulations. We compare these models to observational data from large galaxy surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results show that the TPCF is sensitive to various cosmological parameters, such as the matter density and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. We also investigate the impact of galaxy bias, which is the tendency of galaxies to cluster differently than the underlying matter distribution. Our findings suggest that accurate modeling of the TPCF is crucial for understanding the large-scale structure of the universe and testing cosmological theories.

1654	Denef and Loeser defined a map from the Grothendieck ring of sets definable in pseudo-finite fields to the Grothendieck ring of Chow motives, thus enabling to apply any cohomological invariant to these sets. We generalize this to perfect, pseudo algebraically closed fields with pro-cyclic Galois group. In addition, we define some maps between different Grothendieck rings of definable sets which provide additional information, not contained in the associated motive. In particular we infer that the map of Denef-Loeser is not injective.
D2-79	Greenland is as old as the rest of the earth. And it has no other name than Grønland or Grœnland both of which translate and even sound close to Greenland. The very first humans there were Vikings or Norse, which as government evolved became Denmark. Norway and Denmark, Iceland and Faroe Islands, even areas of England and Scotland ruled by Vikings came under a united Denmark. The story is Ingólgur Arnason wanted to discourage more people coming so named his discovery Iceland, but Eric the Red wanting to encourage settlers named his discovery Greenland although Greenland is more appropriate for Iceland and Iceland more appropriate for Greenland. Just consider them early examples of 5th Avenue Advertizing.
1711	This research paper explores the detection and identification of low-frequency oscillation modes in rotating B-type stars. The authors analyze data from the TESS and Kepler space telescopes to study the pulsational properties of these stars. They find that rotation affects the frequency and amplitude of oscillation modes, making it difficult to accurately identify them. However, they suggest that a combination of observational and theoretical methods may improve the prospects for detecting and characterizing these modes in the future.
2861	We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its critical temperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be achieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation time is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from above. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the dependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not have to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the induced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.
4008	The migration of giant planets in viscous power-law discs has been a topic of intense research in the field of astrophysics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the migration process, considering the effects of viscosity and disc density profiles. Using numerical simulations, we find that the migration of giant planets is strongly dependent on the disc viscosity and density slope. Our results show that highly viscous discs promote inward migration, while steep density profiles tend to inhibit it. We also observe the formation of planet traps in regions of the disc where the migration is slowed down, which can lead to the accumulation of multiple planets. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of giant planet migration in protoplanetary discs and sheds light on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.

The study also highlights the importance of considering crystal anisotropy in understanding NTE in Zn(CN)2. These findings provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of NTE in molecular materials and offer potential applications in thermal management.

The results show that there is a significant correlation between the presence of active galactic nuclei and the properties of their host galaxies, such as their mass and morphology. Additionally, the study finds that early-type galaxies are generally less likely to have active star formation compared to star-forming and AGN host galaxies. These findings provide insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies and their different types.
1108	Noise, corruptions and variations in face images can seriously hurt the performance of face recognition systems. To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.

We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.

The difference between the two regimes is shown to consist in whether it is necessary or not to take into account the renormalization of parameters by the fluctuations of disorder in the vicinity of the optimal fluctuation.
2315	The research paper investigates the impact of spin-zero particle-photon interactions on light polarization in external magnetic fields.

118	This research paper introduces a novel algorithm called the Parameter-Less Self-Organizing Map (PLSOM) that eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning in self-organizing maps (SOMs). The PLSOM algorithm utilizes a dynamic learning rate and neighborhood function to adapt to the data distribution and achieve superior performance compared to traditional SOMs. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PLSOM algorithm in preserving the topology of high-dimensional data. The study concludes that PLSOM can serve as a promising tool for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
2529	We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation. Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.
3780	In this research paper, the authors investigate the thermal entanglement properties of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, a two-dimensional lattice system with frustrated interactions. They find that the entanglement entropy of the qubit pairs exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as the temperature is increased, with a peak at a critical temperature. This behavior is attributed to the competition between the thermal fluctuations and the underlying lattice geometry. The authors also show that the critical temperature can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the interactions. Overall, the results suggest that the Shastry-Sutherland lattice is a promising platform for exploring entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems.
970	There is evidence for the existence of massive planets at orbital radii of several hundred AU from their parent stars where the timescale for planet formation by core accretion is longer than the disc lifetime. These planets could have formed close to their star and then migrated outwards. We consider how the transfer of angular momentum by viscous disc interactions from a massive inner planet could cause significant outward migration of a smaller outer planet. We find that it is in principle possible for planets to migrate to large radii. We note, however, a number of effects which may render the process somewhat problematic.

Using these properties we infer the stability of the scheme.

3638	The glass transition in one-component liquids with anisotropic potential is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. In this research paper, we investigate the mechanism of glass transition using computer simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the anisotropy of the potential has a significant impact on the glass-forming ability of the liquid. We find that the glass transition occurs when the relaxation time of the liquid becomes extremely long, and the system becomes stuck in a metastable state. Moreover, we show that the dynamics of the glass transition can be described by a mode-coupling theory, which predicts the existence of a critical point separating the liquid and glass phases. Our findings provide insight into the fundamental physics of glass transition and have important implications for materials science and engineering.

The study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the relationship between information, information processing, and gravity and highlights the need for further research in this area.
4001	We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations. We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using a current with a one point support.
533	A Fokker action for post-Minkowski approximation with the first post-Newtonian correction is introduced in our previous paper, and a solution for the helically symmetric circular orbit is obtained. We present supplemental results for the circular solution of two unequal mass point-particles. Circular solutions for selected mass ratios are found numerically, and analytic formulas in the extreme mass ratio limit are derived. The leading terms of the analytic formulas agree with the first post-Newtonian formulas in this limit.
2539	An exact analytic representation of the critical state of a current-carrying type-II superconductor strip located inside a cylindrical magnetic cavity of high permeability is derived. The obtained results show that, when the cavity radius is small, penetration of magnetic flux fronts is strongly reduced as compared to the situation in an isolated strip. From our generic representation it is possible to establish current profiles in closed cavities of various other geometries too by means of conformal mapping of the basic configuration addressed.
3038	This research paper proposes an opportunistic relay selection scheme with limited feedback in a cooperative communication system. The main objective is to improve the system's performance by selecting the most suitable relay node to forward the information. The proposed scheme utilizes a feedback mechanism that reduces the amount of feedback required from the source node, thus conserving resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant performance gains compared to conventional schemes, particularly in scenarios with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The study concludes that the proposed scheme is an effective solution for improving the performance of cooperative communication systems with limited feedback.

The study also shows that the disk geometry and the black hole spin play significant roles in shaping the X-ray spectrum. The findings highlight the importance of accurate modeling of the accretion disk and the black hole properties for understanding the X-ray emission of black hole candidates.
3678	Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis.
2438	"We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium. The general nature of the solution is similar to the ""Bondi solution"", but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars."
2149	We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles. The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and glueballs.
109	"We first present a simple proof that for any bipartite lattice at half filling the RKKY interaction is antiferromagnetic between impurities on opposite (i.e., A and B) sublattices and is ferromagnetic between impurities on the same sublattices. This result is valid on all length scales. We then focus on the honeycomb lattice and examine the theorem in the long distance limit by performing the low energy calculation using Dirac electrons. To find the universal (cutoff free) result we perform the calculation in smooth cutoff schemes, as we show that the calculation based on a sharp cutoff leads to wrong results. We also find the long distance behavior of the RKKY interaction between ""plaquette"" impurities in both coherent and incoherent regimes."
875	This research paper explores the phenomenon of Vacuum Cherenkov radiation in the context of spacelike Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory.

The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future experiments and the study of fundamental physics.
3494	The main result of this paper is a quasi-hamiltonian analogue of a special case of the O'Shea-Sjamaar convexity theorem for usual momentum maps. We denote by U a simply connected compact connected Lie group and we fix an involutive automorphism of maximal rank on this Lie group (such an automorphism always exists). We then denote by M a quasi-hamiltonian U-space and we prove that the image under the momentum map of the fixed-point set of a form-reversing compatible involution of M is a convex polytope, which is in fact equal to the full momentum polytope. This theorem was announced in arXiv:math/0609517v1. As an application, we obtain an example of lagrangian subspace in representation spaces of surface groups.
566	Tracking individual nano-objets in live cells during arbitrary long times is an ubiquitous need in modern biology. We present here a method for tracking individual 5 nm gold nanoparticles on live cells. It relies on the photothermal effect and the detection of the Laser Induced Scattering around a NanoAbsorber (LISNA). The key point for recording trajectories at video rate is the use of a triangulation procedure. The effectiveness of the method is tested against Single fluorescent Molecule Tracking in live COS7 cells on subsecond time scales. We further demonstrate recordings for several minutes of AMPA receptors trajectories on the plasma membrane of live neurons. SNaPT has the unique potential to record arbitrary long trajectory of membrane proteins using non-fluorescent nanometer sized labels.

346	We have performed spatially resolved Polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Microscopy measurements on as-grown and annealed Ga0.95Mn0.05As thin films with tensile strain. We find that the films exhibit very strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is increased upon annealing. During magnetic reversal, the domain walls propagate along the direction of surface ripples for the as-grown sample at low temperatures and along the [110] direction for the annealed sample. This indicates that the magnetic domain pattern during reversal is determined by a combination of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a distribution of pinning sites along the surface ripples that can be altered by annealing. These mechanisms could lead to an effective method of controlling domain wall propagation.

In this paper we present a protocol for mutual exchange of secrets, 1-out-of-2 OT and coin flipping similar to Diffie-Hellman protocol using the idea of obliviously exchanging encryption keys. Since, Diffie-Hellman scheme is widely used, our protocol may provide a useful alternative to the conventional methods for implementation of oblivious transfer and a useful primitive in building larger cryptographic schemes.
1351	A discrete Laplace transform and its inversion formula are obtained by using a quadrature of the continuous Fourier transform which is given in terms of Hermite polynomials and its zeros. This approach yields a convergent discrete formula for the two-sided Laplace transform if the function to be transformed falls off rapidly to zero and satisfy certain conditions of integrability, achieving convergence also for singular functions. The inversion formula becomes a quadrature formula for the Bromwich integral. This procedure also yields a quadrature formula for the Mellin transform and its corresponding inversion formula that can be generalized straightforwardly for functions of several variables.

Overall, the results of the HYDE-PARC project provide new insights into the complex dynamics of star clusters and their evolution over time.
556	We present the observation of optical fields carrying squeezed vacuum states at sideband frequencies from 10Hz to above 35MHz. The field was generated with type-I optical parametric oscillation below threshold at 1064nm. A coherent, unbalanced classical modulation field at 40MHz enabled the generation of error signals for stable phase control of the squeezed vacuum field with respect to a strong local oscillator. Broadband squeezing of approximately -4dB was measured with balanced homodyne detection. The spectrum of the squeezed field allows a quantum noise reduction of ground-based gravitational wave detectors over their full detection band, regardless of whether homodyne readout or radio-frequency heterodyne readout is used.

We investigate the security of the protocol under various eavesdropping attacks and derive a lower bound on the secure key rate. Our analysis reveals that the heterodyne detection method can achieve a higher secure key rate compared to the standard homodyne detection approach. We also demonstrate that our bound is tight, which means that it provides an accurate estimation of the achievable secure key rate. Our results suggest that coherent states quantum key distribution with heterodyne detection can be a promising approach for secure communication in practical quantum networks.

111	"We describe the geometry of geodesics on a Lorentz ellipsoid: give explicit formulas for the first integrals (pseudo-confocal coordinates), curvature, geodesically equivalent Riemannian metric, the invariant area-forms on the time- and space-like geodesics and invariant 1-form on the space of null geodesics. We prove a Poncelet-type theorem for null geodesics on the ellipsoid: if such a geodesic close up after several oscillations in the ""pseudo-Riemannian belt"", so do all other null geodesics on this ellipsoid."
518	This research paper investigates the consistency between the renormalization group running of chiral operator and the counting rule, focusing on the case of chiral pion production operator. The main objective is to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between renormalization group running and counting rules in chiral effective field theory. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the renormalization group equations for the chiral pion production operator and derives the corresponding counting rule. The key result of the study is the demonstration of the consistency between the renormalization group running and the counting rule, which provides a solid foundation for the application of the chiral effective field theory to the calculation of physical observables. The research concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for future research in the field of chiral effective field theory.
3929	This research paper investigates the relaxation phenomena in high-temperature superconductors HoBa2Cu3O7-d under the influence of pulsed magnetic fields. The main objective of the study is to understand the behavior of the superconductor under the influence of a magnetic field and to determine the factors that affect its relaxation. The experiment involves applying pulsed magnetic fields with varying strengths to the superconductor and measuring its relaxation time. The study reveals that the relaxation time of the superconductor is affected by the strength of the magnetic field and the temperature of the sample. The results also suggest that the relaxation time of the superconductor can be used as an indicator of its superconducting properties. The study has important implications for the development of high-temperature superconductors for practical applications in various fields.
961	The study investigates the possibility of a double main sequence turn-off (DMSTO) in the star cluster NGC 1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers analyze the color-magnitude diagrams of the stars in the cluster and find evidence for a DMSTO. This phenomenon is associated with the presence of multiple generations of stars in a cluster, which has important implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and the formation of star clusters. The authors discuss possible scenarios for the origin of the DMSTO and suggest further observations to confirm their findings.
3701	The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found.
1549	This research paper explores the impact of the late stages of stellar evolution on the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies. The study examines the emission spectra of galaxies and how they are affected by the presence of older stars. The results indicate that the presence of older stars can significantly alter the shape and intensity of the emission spectra, with implications for the interpretation of observations of distant galaxies. The study concludes that a better understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution is essential for accurately interpreting the properties of galaxies and their evolution over time.
1548	"The connection between AGB evolution of stellar populations and infrared vs. ultraviolet properties of the parent galaxies is reviewed relying on the updated lookout provided by population-synthesis theory. In particular, planetary-nebula events and hot horizontal-branch evolution are assessed in a unitary view to outline a plain general picture of galaxy spectrophotometric evolution. This will include a brief discussion of relevant phenomena such as the ""UV upturn"" in ellipticals and the stellar mass loss properties along the galaxy morphological sequence."
2912	This research paper proposes a neurodynamical model that explains the behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli. The model takes into account the interaction between brain regions and the influence of neurotransmitters. Through simulations and empirical evidence, the study shows that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex play important roles in processing aversive stimuli and regulating behavioral responses. The model also suggests that individual differences in neurotransmitter levels can modulate the behavioral response to aversive stimuli. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying aversion and suggests potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
1613	This research paper explores the possibility of using moving gap solitons in periodic potentials as a basis for various applications. The study investigates the dynamics of these solitons and their behavior under different conditions. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulations, which demonstrate the potential of these solitons for applications such as optical communication, signal processing, and sensing. The results suggest that moving gap solitons in periodic potentials can be a promising basis for various applications, and further experimental studies are necessary to validate these findings.
D2-19	Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics. It involves a hypothetical scenario where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a poison mechanism. If the radioactive atom decays (a random quantum event), the poison is released, killing the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until observed, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states. This implies the cat would be simultaneously both alive and dead until someone opens the box to check. The experiment highlights the disconnect between quantum mechanical principles and our everyday experience of reality, challenging our understanding of observation.
3409	The concept of equivalence has been a central theme in the study of spacetimes. In this research paper, we investigate the equivalence of three-dimensional spacetimes. We focus on the notion of isometry, which captures the idea of preserving distances and angles between points. We consider three different types of three-dimensional spacetimes, namely, flat, hyperbolic, and spherical. Using the tools of differential geometry, we explore the properties of isometries in each of these spacetimes. We then examine the relationship between these spacetimes through the lens of isometry. Our analysis reveals that the three-dimensional spacetimes are not equivalent in the sense of isometry. Our findings have important implications for the study of spacetimes and contribute to a deeper understanding of the geometry of the universe.
2949	"In this research paper, the authors investigate the thermal conductance of nanowires in different dimensions. They find that the thermal conductance of nanowires increases as the diameter decreases, but as the nanowires become thinner, the thermal conductance converges to the conductance of a two-dimensional sheet. This phenomenon is referred to as a ""dimensional crossover"" of thermal conductance. The authors also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of thermal conductance in nanowires of different dimensions. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of nanoscale devices that rely on thermal transport."
D1-21	There are three major compounds of life: proteins; lipids and carbohydrates. The perception of sweet taste, mainly associated with advantageous food, has had an important evolutionary influence on different physiological regulation mechanisms. During human development, sugar was always luxury. In 1885 Constantin Fahlberg produced the first artificial sweetener, saccharin, and the scientific establishment was surprised by its extreme sweetness. Significant to this discovery was the fact that sweet taste became affordable to poor people. Following the commercial success of artificial sweeteners, a battle between the sugar and sweetener industries began. Saccharin was claimed to be carcinogenic in rats. However, it was later shown that saccharin is neither toxic nor carcinogenic in normal amounts, yet its reputation remains tarnished.
1667	"My object in the present paper is to: (1) introduce physicists to the life and work of Whitehead; (2) outline the content of his book ""The Principle of Relativity""; (3) present Whitehead's basic criticism of the General Theory of Relativity which, to my mind, has never been rebutted or properly appreciated, even by GTR specialists; (4) propose a significant relevant research problem; and (5) summarize some of the rather radical implications of the acceptance of Whitehead's observations, including that spacetime is not curved."
2522	This research paper investigates the effect of supernova asymmetry on the coalescence rates of binary neutron stars. The study used numerical simulations to model the evolution of binary neutron stars, including their supernova explosions. The results showed that asymmetrical supernova explosions can significantly affect the coalescence rates of binary neutron stars, with some systems experiencing delays in their merger timescales. These findings have important implications for gravitational wave astronomy, as they suggest that the observed merger rates of binary neutron stars may be affected by the asymmetry of their supernova explosions.
2441	This research paper explores the behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in one dimension at a nonzero chemical potential. We investigate the phase structure of this system and analyze the effects of temperature and chemical potential on the system's properties. Our results show that the system exhibits a rich phase structure, including a chiral condensate phase and a superfluid phase. Moreover, we found that the phase structure is strongly influenced by the chemical potential, which has the potential to significantly impact the fundamental understanding of QCD. Our study has important implications for the study of QCD and sheds light on the possible behavior of this system in extreme conditions.
3611	This research paper aims to investigate the tracking of user attention in collaborative tagging communities. Collaborative tagging is a process where users collectively assign tags to content, such as images or web pages, to organize and classify them. The focus of this study is to explore how user attention can be monitored and analyzed in these communities, specifically examining the factors that influence user attention and the impact of user attention on the quality of tagging and user engagement. The research will employ a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The findings of this research will contribute to the understanding of user behavior and engagement in collaborative tagging communities and inform the development of tools to improve the effectiveness of tagging systems.
3575	The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space. The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link several solutions to the direct kinematic problem without meeting a singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. Additional surfaces are characterized in the workspace which yield new uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator.
1242	"The research paper titled ""Quantisations of piecewise affine maps on the torus and their quantum limits"" explores the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus. The paper focuses on the quantisation of these maps and their corresponding quantum limits. The authors establish a connection between the classical and quantum dynamics of these maps, using tools from algebraic geometry and quantum mechanics. They show that the quantum limits of these maps are determined by their classical dynamics and provide explicit examples to illustrate their results. Overall, the paper provides a framework for understanding the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus and sheds light on the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics."
3760	This research paper focuses on the construction of initial data for 3+1 numerical relativity. The main points covered include a review of the 3+1 formalism, a discussion on the different types of initial data, and a detailed explanation of the conformal transverse-traceless decomposition method. The paper also includes noteworthy findings, such as the importance of choosing suitable gauge conditions and the potential use of conformal techniques in constructing initial data for binary black hole simulations. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of accurate initial data in numerical relativity simulations and the potential impact on gravitational wave observations.
1103	We study the transverse Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a Riemannian foliation on a compact manifold. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition when the transverse LS category is finite. We also introduce a variation on the concept of transverse LS category, the essential transverse category, and show that this is finite for every Riemannian foliation and coincides with the transverse category if the latter is finite. Moreover we prove that the essential transverse category is a lower bound for the number of critical leaf closures of a basic differentiable function on M.
1422	"The research paper titled ""Renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions: fidelity versus entanglement"" explores the role of fidelity and entanglement in quantum phase transitions. The study shows that the fidelity, or the overlap between the ground states of two different Hamiltonians, can serve as a powerful tool in detecting quantum phase transitions. Moreover, the paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how entanglement entropy changes as a function of the RG flow parameter. The findings suggest that entanglement entropy can also serve as a useful tool in characterizing quantum phase transitions. The research concludes by highlighting the importance of using both fidelity and entanglement entropy in understanding the dynamics of quantum phase transitions."
2659	The article focuses on a survey of XMM-Newton spectra to investigate why some intermediate polars exhibit soft X-ray emissions. The authors analyzed the spectra of 26 intermediate polars and found that 11 of them showed soft X-ray emission. They concluded that the soft X-ray emission in intermediate polars is likely due to the presence of optically thick, magnetically confined accretion shocks. Additionally, they found that the properties of the soft X-ray emission varied among the intermediate polars, suggesting that there may be different physical mechanisms at play. This study provides insight into the complex accretion processes occurring in intermediate polars and highlights the importance of high-quality X-ray observations for studying these systems.
3014	This research paper examines the collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market. The main objective of this study is to investigate the existence and strength of the collective behavior among stocks in the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), Pakistan. Using daily stock returns data spanning from January 2001 to December 2017, we apply the network-based methodology to analyze the interdependence and synchronization of stock returns. Our findings reveal that the KSE exhibits strong collective behavior, indicating that stock prices are highly interdependent and synchronized. Moreover, our analysis shows that this collective behavior is affected by external shocks, such as political instability and economic crises. These findings have important implications for investors, policymakers, and regulators who seek to understand the dynamics of the emerging market and develop effective investment strategies.
1106	This research paper investigates the interplay between magnetic properties and thermoelectricity in misfit and Na cobaltates. The study involved the synthesis and characterization of the cobaltates, including measuring their magnetic properties and thermoelectricity. The results indicate that the magnetic properties have a significant impact on the thermoelectric performance of the cobaltates. The misfit cobaltates exhibit higher thermoelectric performance than their Na counterparts due to their unique crystal structures and magnetic properties. The findings suggest that the magnetic properties of cobaltates can be tailored to improve their thermoelectric performance, which could have implications for developing more efficient thermoelectric materials.
1948	We study the flow response to an externally imposed homogeneous magnetic field in a turbulent swirling flow of liquid sodium -- the VKS2 experiment in which magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm up to 50 are reached. Induction effects are larger than in the former VKS1 experiment. At Rm larger than about 25, the local amplitude of induced field components supersedes that of the applied field, and exhibits non-Gaussian fluctuations. Slow dynamical instationarities and low-frequency bimodal dynamics are observed in the induction, presumably tracing back to large scale fluctuations in the hydrodynamic flow.
3291	"We consider the formation of OB associations from two perspectives: (a) the fractional gas consumption in star formation,epsilon, per dynamical time scale t_dyn in a galaxy, and (b) the origin of the so-called Kennicutt-Schmidt law that the rate of star formation per unit area is proportional to a power, alpha, of the surface density in HI and H_2 gas when certain thresholds are crossed. The empirical findings that epsilon is approximately 0.01 and alpha is approximately 1.4 or 1.5 have simple explanations if the rate of star formation is magnetically regulated. An empirical test of the ideas resides in an analysis of why giant OB associations are ``strung out like pearls along the arms"" of spiral galaxies."
3146	We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
3384	We illustrate through numerical results a number of features of environment-induced decoherence under a broad class of apparatus-environment interactions in quantum measurements wherein the reduced system-apparatus density matrix evolves towards the nearest separable state and, in addition, there occurs a mixing in relevant groups of apparatus microstates (see below). The resulting final state is unique and correctly embodies the measurement statistics even in the absence of environment-induced superselection because of energy differences between these groups of states. The partial transpose remains non-positive throughout the process.
3386	Using AdS/CFT correspondence and the Euclidean action formalism for black hole entropy Kraus and Larsen have argued that the entropy of a BTZ black hole in three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry does not receive any correction from higher derivative terms in the action. We argue that as a consequence of AdS/CFT correspondence the action of a three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry cannot receive any higher derivative correction except for those which can be removed by field redefinition. The non-renormalization of the entropy then follows as a consequence of this and the invariance of Wald's formula under a field redefinition.
3549	This research paper focuses on developing a variable-rate distributed source coding scheme that can effectively deal with Byzantine sensors in wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme employs a novel distortion metric to identify the faulty sensors and excludes them from the decoding process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in the reconstruction quality compared to existing methods. The findings of this research can lead to the development of more reliable and efficient distributed source coding schemes for wireless sensor networks in the presence of Byzantine sensors.
470	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of softening of the equation of state of matter at high densities and temperatures. We explore two possible explanations for this phenomenon: chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement. By analyzing data from experiments and simulations, we compare the predictions of these two theories and assess their validity. Our findings suggest that both mechanisms may contribute to the observed softening of the equation of state, but further research is needed to fully understand the underlying physical processes. These results have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in neutron stars and the early universe.
2367	This research paper investigates the use of a CF3I-based SDD prototype for spin-independent dark matter searches. The study aims to explore the efficacy of this prototype in detecting dark matter particles. The research involves the use of Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the performance of the prototype in detecting various dark matter particles. The results show that the CF3I-based SDD prototype has a high sensitivity to dark matter particles and can effectively distinguish between signal and background events. The study concludes that the prototype has great potential for use in future dark matter experiments.
D2-92	With the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) from research laboratories into routine clinical use, it is important to redefine the most appropriate use of each imaging technique. The aim of this review article is to show the potential of PET in oncology. We discuss the most promising indications and the perspectives for the future. We will also point out the shortcomings and the important questions to be answered before fully considering PET as a necessary tool in the day-to-day practice of oncology. Although many studies have documented the high accuracy of 18F-FDG PET for the detection and staging of malignant tumours and for the monitoring of therapy results in these patients.
3933	This research paper explores the application of general asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations to phase transitions in quantum gravity. The authors use the concept of critical exponents to identify the behavior of the system near a phase transition. They propose a method to calculate the critical exponents based on the asymptotic behavior of the metric tensor near the transition point. The authors also introduce a new class of asymptotic solutions, called the critical solutions, which exhibit the same scaling behavior as the system near a phase transition. They demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by analyzing a simple example of a black hole in anti-de Sitter space. The paper concludes that the general asymptotic solutions can provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum gravity near phase transitions.
1360	The research paper explores the use of the generator coordinate method (GCM) in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) to simplify the memory requirements of the theory. The GCM reduces the number of variables needed to describe the system, making it more computationally efficient. The authors present various applications of the GCM in TDDFT, including the calculation of response functions and the study of excitations in molecules and solids. The paper concludes that the GCM is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of TDDFT calculations while maintaining accuracy.
1137	"Taking matrix as a synonym for a numerical function on the Cartesian product of two (in general, infinite) sets, a simple purely algebraic ""reciprocity property"" says that the set of rows spans a finite-dim space iff the set of columns does so. Similar topological reciprocity properties serve to define strongly compact and weakly compact matrices, featured in the well-known basic facts about almost periodic functions and about compact operators. Some properties, especially for the weak compact case, are investigated, such as the connection with the matrix having a Fubini-like property for general means. These are applied to prove possibility of extension to the entire semigroup of bounded densely defined semigroups of operators in a Banach space with weak continuity properties."
2996	This research paper explores the dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds, a theoretical construct in which our observable universe is a four-dimensional membrane embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The dynamical Casimir effect refers to the production of particles from vacuum fluctuations in a rapidly changing cavity. This paper investigates the effect on the braneworld scenario and its implications for experimental testing. The main conclusion is that the braneworld model can lead to significant modifications in the dynamical Casimir effect, with potential consequences for the interpretation and detection of this phenomenon. This paper provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing investigation of the nature of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics.
2937	This paper explores the fluctuations in glassy systems, specifically the effects of temperature and aging on the dynamics of these systems. Using numerical simulations and experiments, the study found that the fluctuations in glassy systems are strongly influenced by temperature and aging, leading to changes in the system's relaxation time and the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity. The results suggest that the behavior of glassy materials is highly complex and cannot be explained solely by their initial structure, but also by their history and the external factors affecting them. Understanding these fluctuations is crucial for developing more accurate models and predicting the behavior of glassy materials in various applications.
3615	This research paper presents a study on the use of optical dilution and feedback cooling to achieve ultra-low temperature in a gram-scale oscillator. The experiment involves the use of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator along with a high-power optical cavity to cool the oscillator down to 6.9 mK. The results show that the combined use of these techniques can provide a powerful tool for achieving extremely low temperatures in macroscopic systems. This research has significant implications for developing novel technologies that require ultra-cold temperatures, such as quantum computers and gravitational wave detectors.
349	This research paper explores the phenomenon of large scale intermittency in the atmospheric boundary layer. The main theme of the paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric turbulence and its impacts on atmospheric transport and mixing. The study uses observational data and numerical simulations to examine the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations. The noteworthy results of the research suggest that large scale intermittency is a universal feature of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, and that it has significant implications for the transport and dispersion of air pollutants. The paper concludes that a better understanding of large scale intermittency is crucial for improving air quality models and predicting the dispersion of air pollutants in urban environments.
2626	"The research paper titled ""Comment on 'Mass and Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD'"" presents a critical analysis of a recent study on the properties of the lowest resonance in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The primary theme of the paper is to examine the methodology used in the original study and to provide alternative calculations to support or refute the findings. The authors conclude that while the original study provides interesting insights into the behavior of the resonance, there are limitations to the methodology used that need to be addressed. The paper highlights the importance of careful analysis and open discussion in advancing our understanding of QCD resonances."
2472	This research paper proposes a novel high-dimensional variable selection method that is capable of identifying the most important variables in datasets with a large number of features. The proposed method is tested on several real-world datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper concludes that the proposed method can be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in various fields, where high-dimensional data analysis is crucial.
850	The article discusses the potential of two long period, massive binary systems (HD 37366 and HD 54662) as targets for long baseline optical interferometry. The authors analyze the available data on these systems, including photometric and spectroscopic observations, to determine their physical parameters and orbital properties. They then explore how these systems could be studied using interferometry techniques to gain further insights into their properties and evolution. The authors conclude that both HD 37366 and HD 54662 are excellent targets for interferometry observations and could provide valuable information about the physics of massive binary systems. Overall, the article highlights the importance of using advanced observational techniques to better understand the properties and evolution of binary star systems.
2402	In this paper Arabic was investigated from the speech recognition problem point of view. We propose a novel approach to build an Arabic Automated Speech Recognition System (ASR). This system is based on the open source CMU Sphinx-4, from the Carnegie Mellon University. CMU Sphinx is a large-vocabulary; speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition system based on discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We build a model using utilities from the OpenSource CMU Sphinx. We will demonstrate the possible adaptability of this system to Arabic voice recognition.
797	In some models of supersymmetry breaking, modulus fields are heavy enough to decay before BBN. But the large entropy produced via moduli decay significantly dilutes the preexisting baryon asymmetry of the universe. We study whether Affleck-Dine mechanism can provide enough baryon asymmetry which survives the dilution, and find several situations in which desirable amount of baryon number remains after the dilution. The possibility of non-thermal dark matter is also discussed. This provides the realistic cosmological scenario with heavy moduli.
3434	The paper investigates the band gap structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are strips of graphene with varying widths and edge shapes. Using density functional theory calculations, the authors demonstrate that the band gap of GNRs is highly dependent on their width and edge shape. Specifically, GNRs with zigzag edges have a band gap that decreases with increasing width, while those with armchair edges have a constant band gap regardless of width. The authors also show that the band gap of GNRs can be tuned by introducing defects or functional groups. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of GNR-based electronic devices.
250	"This research paper abstract comments on the article titled ""Intensity correlations and mesoscopic fluctuations of diffusing photons in cold atoms."" The paper explores the behavior of photons in cold atoms, specifically focusing on intensity correlations and mesoscopic fluctuations. The study found that the behavior of photons in cold atoms can be described by a combination of classical and quantum physics, with the latter being more prominent at lower temperatures. The paper concludes that these findings have significant implications for future research in the field of cold atoms and photon behavior."
113	Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and support vector machines (SVM) are introduced to classify faults in a population of cylindrical shells. The proposed procedures are tested on a population of 20 cylindrical shells and their performance is compared to the procedure, which uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). The modal properties extracted from vibration data are used to train the GMM, SVM and MLP. It is observed that the GMM produces 98%, SVM produces 94% classification accuracy while the MLP produces 88% classification rates.
1810	Since its discovery in the 1930s, the muon has played an important role in our quest to understand the sub-atomic theory of matter. The muon was the first second-generation standard-model particle to be discovered, and its decay has provided information on the (Vector -Axial Vector) structure of the weak interaction, the strength of the weak interaction, G_F, and the conservation of lepton number (flavor) in muon decay. The muon's anomalous magnetic moment has played an important role in restricting theories of physics beyond the standard standard model, where at present there is a 3.4 standard-deviation difference between the experiment and standard-model theory. Its capture on the atomic nucleus has provided valuable information on the modification of the weak current by the strong interaction which is complementary to that obtained from nuclear beta decay.
2943	Photon splitting is a phenomenon that occurs in the presence of a strong laser field. In this process, a single photon is split into two photons with lower energies. The study of this process is of great interest in the field of quantum optics and has potential applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we investigate the conditions required for photon splitting to occur and the resulting properties of the split photons. We also discuss the potential applications of this process in the development of quantum technologies. Our findings suggest that photon splitting may be a promising avenue for the creation of entangled photon pairs and the generation of non-classical states of light.
4016	Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in many quantum technologies. In this research paper, we investigate whether local interactions with not-completely-positive maps can increase entanglement. We introduce a novel technique to study the dynamics of entanglement and apply it to a set of model systems. We find that, under certain conditions, the entanglement between two subsystems can indeed increase due to the local interactions with not-completely-positive maps. This result has important implications for the design of quantum devices and sheds light on the fundamental questions of non-Markovianity and quantum correlations. Our work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the role of not-completely-positive maps in the dynamics of quantum entanglement.
2259	"The research paper titled ""Path Distinguishability in Double Scattering of Light by Atoms"" explores the phenomenon of double scattering of light by atoms and the ability to distinguish between the possible paths of the scattered photons. The study uses a theoretical model to analyze the interference patterns of the scattered photons and their relationship to the path distinguishability. The main finding of the research is that the degree of distinguishability between the paths depends on the scattering angle and the polarization of the incident light. The research concludes that the path distinguishability in double scattering can be controlled by adjusting the incident light and atomic parameters, which has implications for quantum information processing and communication."
1105	We present a comparative study of CoO2 layers in the Bi-misfit and NaxCoO2 cobaltates. Co NMR measures the intrinsic susceptibility of the Co layers and is not affected by spurious contributions. At low dopings where room-temperature thermopower (TEP) is large, Curie-Weiss susceptibilities are observed in both materials. But NMR and muSR experiments find neither charge nor spin order down to low temperatures in Bi-misfit, in contrast to the case of NaxCoO2. This demonstrates that metallicity, charge and magnetic orders are specific of the Na layers in NaxCoO2 whereas strong correlations are generic of the cobaltates physics and could explain the large TEP.
2715	This research paper presents a study of physical parameters of evolved stars in clusters and in the field using line-depth ratios. The authors use high-resolution spectra of 56 red giants to determine their effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. They find that the cluster stars have a smaller range of physical parameters compared to field stars, likely due to their common origin and age. The paper also highlights the potential of using line-depth ratios as a powerful tool for studying evolved stars in both cluster and field environments.
3721	Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L. This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
2033	Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.
2027	We consider a two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The variational approximation (VA) predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of 2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.
93	The radiation hardness of silicon charged particle sensors is compared with single crystal and polycrystalline diamond sensors, both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis, which states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and neutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the inelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross section prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the light nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of magnitude more radiation hard than silicon, while at energies below 0.1 GeV the difference becomes significantly smaller.
2156	In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.

The findings highlight the importance of distributed approaches in addressing the challenges of wireless network management and provide insights into the design of effective algorithms for future wireless networks.
1149	The research paper presents a summary of the properties of b-hadrons as of the end of 2006, including their masses, lifetimes, and decay modes. The results were obtained from various experiments conducted at different particle accelerators. The analysis of the data showed consistency with the Standard Model predictions and also provided constraints on its parameters. The paper concludes that the measurements of b-hadron properties have reached a high level of precision, which will be crucial in testing the predictions of the Standard Model and searching for new physics beyond it.
3480	We have investigated the flux transfer characteristics of a switchable flux transformer comprising a superconducting loop and a DC superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID). This system can be used to couple multiple flux qubits with a controllable coupling strength. Its characteristics were measured using a flux input coil and a DC-SQUID for readout coupled to the transformer loop in a dilution refrigerator. The observed characteristics are consistent with the calculation results. We have demonstrated the reversal of the slope of the characteristics and the complete switching off of the transformer, which are useful features for its application as a controllable coupler for flux qubits.
212	There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the issue of whether it is possible for a single photon to exhibit nonlocality. A number of schemes have been proposed that claim to demonstrate this effect, but each has been met with significant opposition. The objections hinge largely on the fact that these schemes use unobservable initial states and so, it is claimed, they do not represent experiments that could actually be performed. Here we show how it is possible to overcome these objections by presenting an experimentally feasible scheme that uses realistic initial states. Furthermore, all the techniques required for photons are equally applicable to atoms. It should, therefore, also be possible to use this scheme to verify the nonlocality of a single massive particle.
1262	"The research paper titled ""Spin-String Interaction in QCD Strings"" investigates the interaction between the spin of quarks and the confining string in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) strings. The main theme of the paper is to explore the impact of spin on the dynamics of QCD strings and its role in the formation of hadrons. The paper employs both analytical and numerical techniques to study the behavior of the spin-string interaction. The study reveals that the spin of quarks affects the shape of the QCD string and can lead to the formation of mesons with non-zero spin. The paper concludes that the spin-string interaction plays a crucial role in the formation of hadrons and sheds new light on the understanding of QCD strings and their properties."
2504	We study the dynamical process of disentanglement of two qubits and two qutrits coupled to an Ising spin chain in a transverse field, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. We use the concurrence and negativity to quantify entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections between the concurrence (negativity) and the decoherence factors are given for two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner state. We find that the concurrence and negativity decay exponentially with fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental system.
2371	This research paper investigates the effects of edge oxidation on the electronic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). Specifically, we explore the possibility of enhancing the half-metallicity of ZGNRs through edge oxidation. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of edge-oxidized ZGNRs. Our results demonstrate that edge oxidation can significantly enhance the half-metallicity of ZGNRs. We also investigate the effects of different edge oxidation configurations on the electronic properties of ZGNRs. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the potential applications of edge-oxidized ZGNRs in spintronics and electronic devices.
1988	This research paper aims to investigate whether individuals perceive themselves as typical or atypical in comparison to others. A sample of 300 participants completed a survey measuring their self-perception of typicality across various domains such as personality, appearance, and behavior. Results revealed that the majority of participants perceived themselves as typical in most domains, with the exception of personality traits. Furthermore, individuals who perceived themselves as atypical reported lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of social anxiety. The findings suggest that individuals' self-perception of typicality plays a crucial role in their psychological well-being. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.
631	"The research paper titled ""A Unified Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Large CDMA Systems"" aims to develop a unified approach to power control in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems that can minimize energy consumption while maintaining a satisfactory quality of service (QoS). The approach is based on a joint optimization of power control and user scheduling, which can achieve significant energy savings without compromising the QoS. The research team conducted extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and found that it can achieve up to 50% energy savings compared to traditional power control methods. The notable conclusion of the study is that the proposed unified approach to energy-efficient power control can be a promising solution for large CDMA systems that require both high performance and energy efficiency."
1267	"We show that if a meromorphic function has a direct singularity over infinity, then the escaping set has an unbounded component and the intersection of the escaping set with the Julia set contains continua. This intersection has an unbounded component if and only if the function has no Baker wandering domains. We also give estimates of the Hausdorff dimension and the upper box dimension of the Julia set of a meromorphic function with a logarithmic singularity over infinity. The above theorems are deduced from more general results concerning functions which have ""direct or logarithmic tracts"", but which need not be meromorphic in the plane. These results are obtained by using a generalization of Wiman-Valiron theory. The method is also applied to complex differential equations."
1787	This research paper presents the results of an experimental study on the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) film thickness in a rolling-sliding contact. The main objective of the study was to validate the analytical predictions of EHL film thickness using a novel experimental setup. The experiments were conducted on a ball-on-disc tribometer, and the film thickness was measured using a capacitance sensor. The results showed good agreement between the experimental and analytical results for a range of operating conditions. The study also showed that the EHL film thickness depends strongly on the viscosity-pressure coefficient and the elastic deformation of the surfaces, and these parameters should be carefully considered in the design of lubricated contacts. The findings of this study have important implications for the design and optimization of tribological systems, particularly in high load and high-speed applications.
3469	This research paper aims to improve the quality of noisy planar nuclear medicine images using a statistical method called mean field annealing. The study proposes a novel approach that utilizes a probabilistic model to estimate the underlying image from the noisy data. The algorithm was applied to simulated and real-world datasets, and the results were compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The findings show that mean field annealing can significantly enhance the image quality, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. The study concludes that the proposed method can be a valuable tool for improving the diagnostic accuracy of planar nuclear medicine images.
650	This research paper discusses the discovery of an abundance of invariant polynomials that satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical problem that has been a topic of research for over a century and is closely related to the distribution of prime numbers. The researchers found that these new polynomials not only satisfy the Riemann hypothesis but also have additional properties that make them useful in a variety of mathematical applications. The paper presents the methodology used to identify these polynomials and provides evidence for their validity. The results of this study are significant as they provide new insights into the Riemann hypothesis and offer potential new avenues for future mathematical research.
3362	This research paper presents the results of an X-ray imaging study of the stellar population in RCW49, an active star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identified a total of 362 X-ray sources within the region, including a number of young, high-mass stars. Our analysis of the X-ray properties of these sources allowed us to estimate their ages, masses, and other physical characteristics. We also compared our results to previous studies of RCW49 and found that our sample of X-ray sources provides a more complete picture of the stellar population in the region. Overall, our study contributes to our understanding of the processes involved in star formation and the evolution of young, massive stars.
4042	Globular clusters (GCs) are spherical groups of stars that orbit around the galactic center. The horizontal branch (HB) is a region in the HR diagram where stars are burning helium in their cores. In this study, we investigate the kinematic properties of GCs with extended HBs, using data from the Gaia mission. We discover that these GCs exhibit a kinematic decoupling, with their cores moving differently from their outer regions. We propose that this decoupling is due to the presence of multiple stellar populations with different ages and metallicities. Our results suggest that the formation and evolution of GCs are more complex than previously thought, and that the extended HB is a useful tracer of their kinematic properties.
3043	The Schrodinger motion of a charged quantum particle in an electromagnetic potential can be simulated by the paraxial dynamics of photons propagating through a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity induces geometric effects that generate an artificial vector potential to which signal photons are coupled. This phenomenon can be implemented with slow light propagating through an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-induced transparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to a reduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift of Aharonov-Bohm type.
778	This research paper focuses on the Brundan-Kazhdan-Lusztig (BKL) and Super Duality Conjectures, which are two fundamental conjectures in the field of algebraic representation theory. The BKL conjecture is concerned with the representation theory of Lie algebras over finite fields, while the Super Duality Conjecture relates the representation theories of two different Lie superalgebras. Through a thorough analysis of various mathematical concepts and techniques, this paper provides a detailed exploration of these conjectures and their implications. The crucial finding of this research is that the BKL and Super Duality Conjectures are closely related and have deep connections to other areas of representation theory, including the study of modular representations and categorification. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of these conjectures in the broader context of algebraic representation theory and suggesting directions for future research.
2075	This research paper explores the relationship between the Poincare Group in physics and the philosophy of Nagarjuna, a Buddhist philosopher. The Poincare Group is a mathematical framework used to describe the physical laws governing the universe. Nagarjuna's philosophy focuses on the concept of emptiness and the non-dual nature of reality. The paper argues that the Poincare Group and Nagarjuna's philosophy share common ground in their approach to physical reality. Both acknowledge the limitations of our understanding of reality and the need for a holistic perspective. The paper concludes that a deeper understanding of the relationship between physics and philosophy can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality.
1062	The study of quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers is an area of active research due to its potential for detecting gravitational waves. In this paper, we investigate the existence of second and higher-order quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers using numerical simulations. Our results show that these modes do indeed exist, and that they can provide valuable information about the properties of the black holes involved in the merger. In particular, we find that the frequencies of these modes are sensitive to the spin of the black holes, providing a new avenue for studying these important astrophysical objects. These findings have important implications for the future detection and analysis of gravitational waves, as well as for our understanding of the dynamics of black hole mergers.
455	We study Mittag-Leffler conditions on modules providing relative versions of classical results by Raynaud and Gruson. We then apply our investigations to several contexts. First of all, we give a new argument for solving the Baer splitting problem. Moreover, we show that modules arising in cotorsion pairs satisfy certain Mittag-Leffler conditions. In particular, this implies that tilting modules satisfy a useful finiteness condition over their endomorphism ring. In the final section, we focus on a special tilting cotorsion pair related to the pure-semisimplicity conjecture.
3628	An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the data, and hence, saves time.
3236	"The research paper titled ""The Solar-Interior Equation of State with the Path-Integral Formalism I. Domain of Validity"" presents a new approach to understanding the equation of state for the solar interior. The authors use the path-integral formalism to calculate the equation of state, which gives a more accurate description of the behavior of matter at high temperatures and densities. The study focuses on the domain of validity of the equation of state and found that the path-integral approach leads to a better agreement with observational data than previous models. The authors conclude that their new approach provides a more accurate description of the solar interior and can be applied to other astrophysical systems."
3795	We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.
2990	We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models, which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples underline the results.
4009	Single-molecule detection with chemical specificity is a powerful and much desired tool for biology, chemistry, physics, and sensing technologies. Surface-enhanced spectroscopies enable single molecule studies, yet reliable substrates of adequate sensitivity are in short supply. We present a simple, scaleable substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes. Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Raman sensitivity, including blinking and spectral diffusion. Electrodynamic simulations show plasmonic focusing, giving electromagnetic enhancements approaching those needed for single-molecule SERS.
3164	Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.
2112	Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics. Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.
3578	The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since more than twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on which are based the best known attacks against the lattice-based encryption schemes mentioned above. Understanding precisely Kannan's algorithm is of prime importance for providing meaningful key-sizes. In this paper we improve the complexity analyses of Kannan's algorithms and discuss the possibility of improving the underlying enumeration strategy.
1647	We present a generalization of the pioneering results obtained for single K-shell photoionization of H-like ions by M. Stobbe [Ann. Phys. 7 (1930) 661] to the case of the helium isoelectronic sequence. The total cross section of the process is calculated, taking into account the correlation corrections to first order of the perturbation theory with respect to the electron-electron interaction. Predictions are made for the entire non-relativistic energy domain. The phenomenon of dynamical suppression of correlation effects in the ionization cross section is discussed.
234	This research paper investigates the angular momentum transport in accretion disks, specifically focusing on the scaling laws in magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulence. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the behavior of accretion disks and their ability to transport angular momentum. The findings suggest that the MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks follows a universal scaling law, which can be used to accurately predict the transport of angular momentum in these systems. This research provides a better understanding of the fundamental processes that drive accretion disks and may have implications for the study of black holes and other astrophysical phenomena.
654	This research paper explores the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as a means of achieving ensemble learning for free. The study investigates several different EA-based approaches to ensemble learning, comparing their performance with traditional ensemble learning methods and analyzing the impact of various factors on their effectiveness. The results of the study show that EA-based ensemble learning can be a powerful tool for improving classification accuracy, particularly when used in conjunction with other optimization techniques. The paper concludes that EA-based ensemble learning is a promising approach for achieving improved classification accuracy in a wide range of applications.
1699	This research paper investigates the scaling behaviors of graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) using a three-dimensional quantum simulation study. The central focus is on analyzing the performance of GNRFETs with varying channel lengths and widths. The results show that the device performance deteriorates as the channel length increases beyond a certain threshold, while the width has a negligible effect on the device performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the impact of quantum confinement on the GNRFET performance. Overall, the findings could aid in the design and optimization of GNRFETs for future electronic applications.
4046	This research paper investigates the phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres with elastic skeletons. The study focuses on the behavior of the model as the elasticity of the skeleton is varied. The paper explores the potential phase transitions that may occur and the critical points associated with these transitions. The research utilizes computational simulations and numerical analysis to describe the phase structure of the model. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the behavior of surface models with elastic skeletons, which has significant implications for the study of physical and biological systems.
3710	This research paper presents some new experimental photonic flame effect features, including the effects of fuel type, fuel-to-air ratio, and flame height on flame luminosity and spectral characteristics. The results show that the fuel type and fuel-to-air ratio significantly affect the flame luminosity and spectral characteristics. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the flame height has a minimal effect on these features. These results can be useful in designing photonic flame effects for various applications, including entertainment and safety systems.
2599	"Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after ""big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2 galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGN/quasar population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN, focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."
2983	This research paper aims to investigate and compare the effects of driven activation and thermal activation on the performance of a particular system. The study uses experimental methods to explore the differences in activation mechanisms and their impact on the system's output. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the experimental results, including the characterization of the activation mechanisms and the identification of the key factors that influence system performance. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of driven activation and thermal activation, and the implications of these mechanisms for the design and optimization of systems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research in this area.
422	This research paper explores the relationship between complementarity, distillable secret key, and distillable entanglement in quantum information. The authors present a new method to calculate the distillable secret key and distillable entanglement for bipartite quantum states and analyze the trade-off between these two quantities. They also show that the complementarity of two quantum measurements can be related to the distillable secret key and distillable entanglement. The findings suggest a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of quantum information and its practical applications.
578	We study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential in the mean-field approximation. Decoherence effects are considered by analyzing the couplings of the condensate to environments. Two kinds of coupling are taken into account. With the first kind of coupling dominated, the decoherence can enhance the self-trapping by increasing the damping of the oscillations in the dynamics, while the decoherence from the second kind of condensate-environment coupling leads to spoiling of the quantum tunneling and self-trapping.
1356	This research paper proposes a new approach to designing large-scale Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems using nature-inspired interconnects. The proposed approach is based on the self-assembly process of biological systems, such as the nervous system in animals and the vascular system in plants. The authors demonstrate that this approach can lead to more efficient and scalable NoC designs compared to traditional interconnect designs. The paper presents a case study of a self-assembled NoC design based on the vascular system of plants, which shows promising results in terms of performance and power consumption. The authors conclude that nature-inspired interconnects have the potential to revolutionize the design of large-scale NoC systems and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable computing systems.
2368	Causality and stability in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics are important conceptual issues. We argue that causality is not restricted to hyperbolic set of differential equations. E.g. heat conduction equation can be causal considering the physical validity of the theory. Furthermore we propose a new concept of relativistic internal energy that clearly separates the dissipative and non-dissipative effects. We prove that with this choice we remove all known instabilities of the linear response approximation of viscous and heat conducting relativistic fluids. In this paper the Eckart choice of the velocity field is applied.
3338	"The research paper titled ""Bimodality in spectator fragmentation"" investigates the phenomenon of bimodal fragmentation in high-energy particle collisions. The study focuses on the primary theme of identifying the sources and characteristics of this phenomenon and its impact on particle physics research. Through extensive simulations and data analysis, the researchers found that bimodality in spectator fragmentation is a robust and common feature of high-energy collisions. The study also highlights the potential of bimodality as a tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions and have important implications for ongoing research in particle physics."
2900	This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy element production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439. However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance. In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element observations.
5	This research paper investigates the percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation, which refers to the relationship between the degrees of the nodes in a network. The authors use numerical simulations to study the behavior of percolation on networks with varying degrees of correlation. The results show that degree-degree correlation can significantly affect the percolation transition, and that networks with positive correlation tend to have a higher percolation threshold than those with negative correlation. The research has important implications for understanding the resilience of real-world networks, such as social networks and transportation networks, to failures and attacks.
2292	We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to this new probability range.
3447	The phonon dynamics in a one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain coupled to finite-frequency bond phonons is studied. We present the first detailed phonon spectra for these systems using Quantum Monte Carlo. The quantum phase transition is dominated by a central peak, yet the renormalisation of the main phonon branch depends strongly on the bare phonon frequency omega_0. The main branch remains largely unaffected at omega_0 \gsim J, but it softens completely when omega_0 is low enough. This is an unusual scenario for a structural phase transition and was observable only on sufficiently large systems. Approaching the dimerized phase from finite temperature, the lattice dynamics mirrors the behavior of a three dimensional system. For the efficient measurement of Greens functions, we introduce a mapping from the stochastic series expansion to continuous imaginary time.
2698	The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial dislocations.
3562	This paper explores a comparative study of both the linear and kernel implementations of three of the most popular Appearance-based Face Recognition projection classes, these being the methodologies of Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. The experimental procedure provides a platform of equal working conditions and examines the ten algorithms in the categories of expression, illumination, occlusion and temporal delay. The results are then evaluated based on a sequential combination of assessment tools that facilitate both intuitive and statistical decisiveness among the intra and interclass comparisons. The best categorical algorithms are then incorporated into a hybrid methodology, where the advantageous effects of fusion strategies are considered.
2561	The Measurement Calculus is a mathematical framework that provides a consistent and unified way of measuring different physical quantities. This paper explores the basic principles of the Measurement Calculus and its applications in various fields of science and engineering. By defining a set of fundamental units and deriving the relationships between them, the Measurement Calculus enables accurate and reliable measurements of physical quantities, such as length, time, mass, and temperature. The paper also discusses the importance of dimensional analysis and unit conversions in the Measurement Calculus, as well as the role of uncertainty and error analysis in measuring physical quantities. The main conclusion of this research is that the Measurement Calculus provides a powerful tool for understanding and quantifying the physical world, and its application can lead to significant advancements in science and technology.
3559	This research paper examines the concept of universal derived equivalences of posets, which involves constructing and analyzing certain categories of posets. The paper presents a novel approach to understanding the relationships between these categories, and provides a number of significant outcomes and conclusions regarding the nature of derived equivalences in posets. Specifically, the paper demonstrates how certain properties of posets can be used to construct universal derived equivalences, and explores the implications of these equivalences for various fields of mathematics. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the structure and behavior of posets, and sheds new light on the fundamental principles of derived equivalences.
608	We introduce a new, highly sensitive, and simple heterodyne optical method for imaging individual nonfluorescent nanoclusters and nanocrystals. A 2 order of magnitude improvement of the signal is achieved compared to previous methods. This allows for the unprecedented detection of individual small absorptive objects such as metallic clusters (of 67 atoms) or nonluminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. The measured signals are in agreement with a calculation based on the scattering field theory from a photothermal-induced modulated index of refraction profile around the nanoparticle.
2581	Ferroelectric spiral magnets DyMnO3 and TbMnO3 show similar behavior of electric polarization in applied magnetic fields. Studies of the field dependence of lattice modulations on the contrary show a completely different picture. Whereas in TbMnO3 the polarization flop from P||c to P||a is accompanied by a sudden change from incommensurate to commensurate wave vector modulation, in DyMnO3 the wave vector varies continuously through the flop transition. This smooth behavior may be related to the giant magnetocapacitive effect observed in DyMnO3.
1811	This research paper explores the fundamental role of muon physics in the Standard Model of particle physics. The paper highlights the unique properties of muons and their interactions with other particles, which have been critical to our understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter. The research also discusses the experimental techniques used to study muons and the recent advancements in technology that have enabled more precise measurements of their properties. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research in muon physics to further our understanding of the Standard Model and potentially uncover new physics beyond this model.
3590	This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.
629	This research paper investigates the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks under quality-of-service constraints. The proposed approach aims to minimize the energy consumption of network nodes while ensuring the satisfaction of QoS requirements for all users. The paper presents a joint optimization model for allocating power and bandwidth resources, taking into account the channel conditions, traffic characteristics, and QoS parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which show significant energy savings compared to other existing methods, while maintaining high QoS levels. The results of this study can be useful for designing energy-efficient wireless networks that can support diverse applications with different QoS requirements.
313	In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.
D2-36	"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. These compounds serve as ingredients in various everyday products, with applications ranging from industrial uses to consumer goods due to their unique water and oil-repellent properties. PFAS are often referred to as ""forever chemicals"" due to their extraordinary environmental persistence They represent persistent contaminants that are particularly challenging to address through conventional wastewater treatment processes Their persistence has made them contaminants of emerging concern in industrialized countries, where they accumulate in the environment over time. Research indicates that PFAS exposure poses significant health risks: PFAS disrupt biological membranes resulting in cellular inhibition."
2797	We investigate if a unital C(X)-algebra is properly infinite when all its fibres are properly infinite. We show that this question can be rephrased in several different ways, including the question if every unital properly infinite C*-algebra is K_1-injective. We provide partial answers to these questions, and we show that the general question on proper infiniteness of C(X)-algebras can be reduced to establishing proper infiniteness of a specific C([0,1])-algebra with properly infinite fibres.
3383	This research paper investigates the nonholonomic Ricci flows and parametric deformations of solitonic pp-waves and Schwarzschild solutions. The study explores the geometrical properties of these solutions and their dynamical evolution. The results show that the nonholonomic Ricci flows can lead to the formation of singularities in the solitonic pp-waves. Furthermore, the parametric deformations of the Schwarzschild solutions reveal interesting properties related to the stability of the black hole horizons. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of these important solutions in general relativity.
1527	This research paper discusses the possibility of diffuse cosmic gamma-rays at 1-20 MeV being a trace of dark matter. Dark matter is believed to exist in the universe in large quantities, but its nature remains unknown. The paper analyzes satellite data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to investigate if the observed gamma-rays can be attributed to dark matter. The results show that it is possible that dark matter is responsible for the observed gamma-rays, but other sources cannot be ruled out. Further research is necessary to confirm the significance of the findings.
1816	We introduce a modified divergence law for the energy-momentum tensor in the theory of unimodular relativity. Consequently, an additional equation for the measure field follows from the divergence of the field equations. The equations of motion are derived and the weak-field, low-velocity limit is investigated. It is found that the gravitational acceleration acquires a term that is proportional to the gradient of the mass density. We show that this term can provide the additional acceleration observed on astrophysical scales without the need for dark matter.
1708	In this paper we derive some new and practical results on testing and interval estimation problems for the population eigenvalues of a Wishart matrix based on the asymptotic theory for block-wise infinite dispersion of the population eigenvalues. This new type of asymptotic theory has been developed by the present authors in Takemura and Sheena (2005) and Sheena and Takemura (2007a,b) and in these papers it was applied to point estimation problem of population covariance matrix in a decision theoretic framework. In this paper we apply it to some testing and interval estimation problems. We show that the approximation based on this type of asymptotics is generally much better than the traditional large-sample asymptotics for the problems.
2088	We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.
1789	The research paper investigates the role of nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering on the density of states (DOS) and supercurrent in diffusive SNS junctions. The study reveals that the DOS is significantly affected by the presence of nonideal interfaces and spin-flip scattering, which can lead to a reduction in the critical current of the junction. The results also suggest that the spin-flip scattering can cause a significant reduction in the supercurrent at higher temperatures. The study provides insights into the role of interface properties and spin scattering on the transport properties of SNS junctions, which can be useful in designing and optimizing superconducting devices.
1763	This research paper investigates the concept of scale invariance in quantum potential, which leads to the emergence of a globally self-trapped wave function in the Madelung fluid. By exploring the mathematical properties of the Schr dinger equation and analyzing the behavior of the wave function, the study reveals that the presence of a scale-invariant quantum potential allows for the formation of a stable and self-localized wave function that persists over time. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and could have potential applications in the development of new technologies such as quantum computing.
815	The unbinding process of a protein-ligand complex of major biological interest was investigated by means of a computational approach at atomistic classical mechanical level. An energy minimisation-based technique was used to determine the dissociation paths of the system by probing only a relevant set of generalized coordinates. The complex problem was reduced to a low-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and the ligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) were also assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effects were accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. The corresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height, in compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour. The computed results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.
3340	The article focuses on the production of light particles, specifically photons, by strong and slowly varying magnetic fields. The study involves the use of a theoretical model to analyze the behavior of photons in such magnetic fields, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms that lead to their production. The main conclusion of the study is that strong and slowly varying magnetic fields can indeed produce photons, and that this process may have applications in areas such as astrophysics and plasma physics. The study also highlights the importance of further research in this area to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications.
305	This research paper analyzes the performance of batch processor sharing systems with hyper-exponential service time, using queueing theory and simulation techniques. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the effects of different system parameters on the performance metrics, such as mean response time and throughput.

Moreover, the study concludes that the use of batch processing can improve the system performance and reduce the response time, especially for large batch sizes and high utilization levels.
2528	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of optical carrier wave shocking and proposes a novel method for detecting and dispersing it. Using a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing the impact of carrier wave shocking on optical communication systems. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating this phenomenon for the reliable operation of high-speed communication networks. Ultimately, our findings have significant implications for the development of more robust and resilient optical communication systems.
3107	Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body Peierls'' state.
3307	We investigate the possibility to localize scalar field configurations as a model for black hole accretion. We analyze and resolve difficulties encountered when localizing scalar fields in General Relativity. We illustrate this ability with a simple spherically symmetric model which can be used to study features of accreting shells around a black hole. This is accomplished by prescribing a scalar field with a coordinate dependent potential. Numerical solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations are shown, where a scalar filed is indeed confined within a region surrounding a black hole. The resulting spacetime can be described in terms of simple harmonic time dependence.
2913	"We report on the realization of a time-domain `St\""uckelberg interferometer', which is based on the internal state structure of ultracold Feshbach molecules. Two subsequent passages through a weak avoided crossing between two different orbital angular momentum states in combination with a variable hold time lead to high-contrast population oscillations. This allows for a precise determination of the energy difference between the two molecular states. We demonstrate a high degree of control over the interferometer dynamics. The interferometric scheme provides new possibilities for precision measurements with ultracold molecules."
1476	Experiments built to search for neutrinoless double beta-decay are limited in their sensitivity not only by the exposure but also by the amount of background encountered. Radioactive isotopes in the surrounding of the detectors which emit gamma-radiation are expected to be a significant source of background in the GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA. Methods to select electron induced events and discriminate against photon induced events inside a germanium detector are presented in this paper. The methods are based on the analysis of the time structure of the detector response. Data were taken with a segmented GERDA prototype detector. It is shown that the analysis of the time response of the detector can be used to distinguish multiply scattered photons from electrons.
2234	Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and homodyne measurement.
3025	"In this paper we give a definition of ""algorithm,"" ""finite algorithm,"" ""equivalent algorithms,"" and what it means for a single algorithm to dominate a set of algorithms. We define a derived algorithm which may have a smaller mean execution time than any of its component algorithms. We give an explicit expression for the mean execution time (when it exists) of the derived algorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with two component algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions for two-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of several general forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithm processor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation scheme with which to analyze empirical processing time data."
3824	The study of graphene on SiC has been a topic of interest due to the potential applications of this material in various fields such as electronics and optoelectronics. In this research paper, an ab initio study of graphene on SiC is presented. The study involved the use of density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure, bonding, and stability of the system. The results show that the graphene-SiC interface is stable and that the electronic properties of the graphene layer are strongly influenced by the SiC substrate. The study also explores the effect of defects and doping on the electronic properties of the system. Overall, the findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of graphene on SiC and its potential applications in various fields.
3802	This research paper focuses on the reliability of the direction of incident neutrinos in fully contained and partially contained events due to Quasi-Elastic (QEL) interactions in the Super-Kamiokande detector. The study analyzes the data obtained from the detector to determine the accuracy of the direction reconstruction and the impact of QEL interactions on the reliability of the results. The findings show that the direction reconstruction for fully contained events is more reliable than for partially contained events due to the higher energy deposition in the former. However, the study suggests that the accuracy of the direction reconstruction can be improved by applying appropriate correction techniques. These results have important implications for future neutrino experiments and their ability to accurately determine the direction of incident neutrinos.
3309	We take into account the constraints from the observed extragalactic gamma-ray background to estimate the maximum duty cycle allowed for a selected sample of WMAP Blazars, in order to be detectable by AGILE and GLAST gamma-ray experiments. For the nominal sensitivity values of both instruments, we identify a subset of sources which can in principle be detectable also in a steady state without over-predicting the extragalactic background. This work is based on the results of a recently derived Blazar radio LogN-LogS obtained by combining several multi-frequency surveys.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the statistical mechanics of complex networks in order to fully leverage their potential for various applications.

The conclusion of the study is that FPGA-based computers can be a promising tool for simulating complex spin systems in various applications, including quantum information processing, condensed matter physics, and materials science.
1570	We study the effect of impurities in superconducting graphene and discuss their influence on the local electronic properties. In particular, we consider the case of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities being either strongly localized or acting as a potential averaged over one unit cell. The spin dependent local density of states is calculated and possibilities for visualizing impurities by means of scanning tunneling experiments is pointed out. A possibility of identifying magnetic scatters even by non spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy is explained.
1688	We present a protocol for performing entanglement connection between pairs of atomic ensembles in the single excitation regime. Two pairs are prepared in an asynchronous fashion and then connected via a Bell measurement. The resulting state of the two remaining ensembles is mapped to photonic modes and a reduced density matrix is then reconstructed. Our observations confirm for the first time the creation of coherence between atomic systems that never interacted, a first step towards entanglement connection, a critical requirement for quantum networking and long distance quantum communications.
2335	By means of low-temperature expansions (LTEs), the nucleation free energy and the precipitate interface free energy are expressed as functions of the solubility limit for alloys which lead to the precipitation of a stoichiometric L12 compound such as Al-Sc or Al-Zr alloys. Classical nucleation theory is then used to obtain a simple expression of the nucleation rate whose validity is demonstrated by a comparison with atomic simulations. LTEs also explain why simple mean-field approximation like the Bragg-Williams approximation fails to predict correct nucleation rates in such an ordering alloy.
D2-18	Insects as food or edible insects are insect species used for human consumption. Over 2 billion people are estimated to eat insects on a daily basis. Globally, more than 2,000 insect species are considered edible, though far fewer are discussed for industrialized mass production and regionally authorized for use in food. Many insects are highly nutritious, though nutritional content depends on species and other factors such as diet and age. Insects offer a wide variety of flavors and are commonly consumed whole or pulverized for use in dishes and processed food products such as burger patties, pasta, or snacks. Like other foods, there can be risks associated with consuming insects, such as allergic reactions.
1243	GREGOR is a new open solar telescope with an aperture of 1.5m. It replaces the former 45-cm Gregory Coude telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The optical concept is that of a double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical mirrors are made from a silicon-carbide material with high thermal conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the near infrared and a 2-dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Perot interferometers for the visible.
3732	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of counter-rotating wave interaction in a trapped ion system and its impact on the ground state. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this interaction leads to a lower ground state energy than the single wave case. This finding has significant implications for quantum information processing using trapped ions, as it suggests a more efficient method for ground state preparation. Our results also highlight the importance of considering counter-rotating wave effects in the design of trapped ion experiments.
1255	We investigate the influence of spin-orbit interaction on ballistic transport through chaotic cavities by using semiclassical methods. Our approach is based on the Landauer formalism and the Fisher-Lee relations, appropriately generalized to spin-orbit interaction, and a semiclassical representation of Green functions. We calculate conductance coefficients by exploiting ergodicity and mixing of suitably combined classical spin-orbit dynamics, and making use of the Sieber-Richter method and its most recent extensions. That way we obtain weak anti-localization and confirm previous results obtained in the symplectic ensemble of Random Matrix Theory.
3062	We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconducting flux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization can be used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin film resistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity of photonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of a high frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequency oscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discuss the performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. This device illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropy as the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of the resistor.
2474	This research paper focuses on the optimization of gradient networks, which can be used to model complex systems such as neural networks and biological processes. The paper explores various optimization techniques, including stochastic gradient descent and convex optimization, and examines their effectiveness in improving the performance of gradient networks. The study concludes that convex optimization methods can be particularly effective in optimizing gradient networks, leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence rates. The findings of this research have important implications for the design and optimization of complex systems in a wide range of fields, including machine learning, biology, and engineering.
4031	We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.
D2-21	The probability of extraterrestrial life existing remains one of science's great unknowns, with estimates varying widely based on different assumptions and models. While we lack direct evidence of life beyond Earth, several scientific factors inform our understanding: The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy by multiplying several probability factors. However, many of these factors remain highly uncertain. Many astrobiologists consider microbial life likely to exist elsewhere, with estimates ranging from cautious to highly optimistic. The probability of intelligent civilizations remains more speculative, with the Fermi Paradox (questioning why we haven't detected them) suggesting either rarity or communication difficulties.
2217	This research paper focuses on the fairness provision in the IEEE 802.11e infrastructure basic service set (IBSS). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the fairness provision mechanism in ensuring fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The research was conducted through simulations using the Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) tool. The results showed that the fairness provision mechanism effectively ensures fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The study also found that the fairness provision mechanism is effective in reducing channel contention and increasing the overall throughput of the IBSS. The paper concludes that the fairness provision mechanism is a crucial component of the IEEE 802.11e standard and should be implemented in all IBSS networks to ensure fair channel access for all stations.

883	This research paper explores the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which are solutions to Einstein's field equations and describe the expansion of the universe. The paper focuses on the mathematical properties of these static forms and derives the necessary conditions for their existence. The main conclusion of the paper is that the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes are limited to specific cases, and that the majority of these spacetimes are expanding or contracting. This research provides valuable insights into the nature of the universe and the mathematical structure of Einstein's theory of general relativity.
1899	This research paper investigates the competing itinerant and localized states in strongly correlated BaVS$_3$. The study employed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to observe the electronic structure of BaVS$_3$ and discovered that the material exhibits a metallic state at high temperatures and a localized state at low temperatures. The results suggest that the localized state is related to the vanadium d-orbitals, while the itinerant state is related to the presence of vanadium d-orbitals mixed with sulfur p-orbitals. This research provides insight into the electronic properties of strongly correlated materials and offers a potential avenue for the design of new materials with desired electronic properties.
3619	This research paper investigates the formation of residual nuclides in different target materials induced by proton beams with energies ranging from 0.04 to 2.6 GeV. Specifically, the study examines the production of residual nuclides in 206,207,208,nat-Pb and 209-Bi, as well as in 56-Fe. The experimental results reveal that the production cross-sections of residual nuclides are strongly dependent on the target material, proton energy, and incident angle. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of nuclear reactions induced by proton beams, and the findings may have implications for the design of future nuclear facilities and radiation shielding.
2374	The Large Hadron Collider, a 7 + 7 TeV proton-proton collider under construction at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva), will take experiments squarely into a new energy domain where mysteries of the electroweak interaction will be unveiled. What marks the 1-TeV scale as an important target? Why is understanding how the electroweak symmetry is hidden important to our conception of the world around us? What expectations do we have for the agent that hides the electroweak symmetry? Why do particle physicists anticipate a great harvest of discoveries within reach of the LHC?
727	The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) has provided three years of observations on the polarization of foreground radiation in the universe. This research paper focuses on the primary discoveries and conclusions drawn from these observations. The study found that polarization in the foreground radiation is caused by the alignment of dust grains in the Milky Way, and that the polarization patterns provide valuable information about the properties of interstellar dust. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of accurate foreground characterization in the study of cosmic microwave background radiation.
3872	The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.
2409	This research paper investigates the entanglement and interference between different degrees of freedom of photon states. The study focuses on the entanglement and interference between polarization and spatial modes of photons. The paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the entanglement and interference between these two degrees of freedom of photon states.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of new photon-based quantum technologies.
1715	"The research paper titled ""ALMA: Fourier phase analysis made possible"" discusses the implementation of a new method to measure the Fourier phase of interferometric data obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The method uses a statistical approach to estimate the phase errors and correct them, resulting in high-quality images with improved resolution and sensitivity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying it to various ALMA datasets, including observations of nearby galaxies and protoplanetary disks. The study concludes that the Fourier phase analysis method is a valuable tool for improving the quality of interferometric data and enhancing our understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes."
641	We present measurements of current noise in quantum point contacts as a function of source-drain bias, gate voltage, and in-plane magnetic field. At zero bias, Johnson noise provides a measure of the electron temperature. At finite bias, shot noise at zero field exhibits an asymmetry related to the 0.7 structure in conductance. The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field. Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus (where shot noise vanishes), agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron heating.
2789	"Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices."
2397	This research paper focuses on the lower bounds for the communication capacities of two-qudit unitary operations. The communication capacity of a quantum channel determines the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through the channel. In this work, we investigate the lower bounds for the communication capacity of two-qudit unitary operations, which are essential building blocks in quantum communication and computing. We provide a rigorous analysis of the lower bounds using a combination of information-theoretic and algebraic techniques. Our results shed new light on the fundamental limits of quantum communication and may have practical implications for the design of quantum communication protocols.
1114	We proved that under quantum mechanics a momentum-energy and a space-time are dual vector spaces on an almost complex manifold in position representation, and the minimal uncertainty relations are equivalent to the inner-product relations of their bases. In a microscopic sense, there exist locally a momentum-energy conservation and a space-time conservation. The minimal uncertainty relations refer to a local equilibrium state for a stable system, and the relations will be invariable in the special relativity. A supposition about something having dark property is proposed, which relates to a breakdown of time symmetry.
3310	This research paper explores the duty-cycles of blazars at gamma-ray frequencies, using data from the Extragalactic Background Radiation. The study finds that blazars have a duty-cycle of approximately 10%, with some variability depending on the specific blazar. The paper also discusses the potential for future research using the AGILE and GLAST telescopes to further investigate duty-cycles and other characteristics of blazars. Overall, this research provides important insights into the behavior of blazars and their impact on the extragalactic background radiation.
945	The abstract of this research paper discusses the lift of noninvariant solutions of heavenly equations from three to four dimensions and the discovery of new ultra-hyperbolic metrics. The paper highlights the significance of analyzing the lift of noninvariant solutions to gain a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of solutions in four dimensions. The researchers used various mathematical techniques to derive the new ultra-hyperbolic metrics, which have critical implications in the field of mathematics and theoretical physics. The findings of this research paper have the potential to expand our knowledge of hyperbolic geometry and its applications in various fields. This paper's critical outcome is the discovery of new ultra-hyperbolic metrics, which can aid in the development of new mathematical models in physics and mathematics.
41	In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane, and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring, but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to have bound orbits that circle through the ring.
3243	We introduce an approach to determining the required waveforms to coherently control the optical energy localization in plasmonic nanosystems. This approach is based on the impulsive localized excitation of the nanosystem and time reversal of the generated far-zone field at a single point with one polarization. Despite strong interaction and significant dephasing and dissipation in metal plasmonic systems, and incompleteness of this time reversal, the proposed approach proves to be very efficient in controlling the nanoscale optical fields. Possible applications include nanoscale spectroscopy and photomodification, ultradense memory, and information processing on the nanoscale.
2022	This research paper investigates the Colle-Salvetti correlation energy functional and its ability to handle the degeneracy problem in molecular systems. The study uncovers the presence of orbital currents in the functional and their contribution to the overall correlation energy. The findings suggest that incorporating these currents could improve the functional's accuracy in handling degeneracy. Overall, this research sheds light on the importance of properly handling degeneracy in molecular systems and provides insights into potential improvements for correlation energy functionals.
3180	We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants. It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants. We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel conceptual proof.
D2-6	The active quest for extra-solar planets has opened a new chapter in the book of the search for extra-terrestrial life. This was already an active field of science with the exploration of the Solar System by means of space probes, which gave rise to a ‘space age’ from 1957 when Sputnik-1, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, was launched. Current technology allows us to land a robotic chemistry laboratory on other Solar System bodies, or return samples to Earth, the latter coming with the advantage of being able to adapt analysis strategies to unexpected findings. Based on our current understanding, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, if we consider life based on a liquid other than water, Titan are the most promising places.
1052	This research paper explores the use of spectral methods in the computation of orthogonal rational functions. The main objective of the study is to develop an efficient and accurate numerical algorithm for computing the zeros and weights of these orthogonal functions. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the spectral methods used in the computation, including the use of Chebyshev polynomials and Gauss-Lobatto quadrature.

3910	Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional, diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the second space derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutions of these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time or variable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. This property is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standard diffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economical problems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of new tools and methods for studying complex systems as evolving information."
1343	The extrinsic size effect in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy of ferroelectric and piezoelectric thin films on non-polar dielectric substrate is analyzed. Analytical expressions for effective piezoresponse, object transfer function components, and Rayleigh two-point resolution are obtained. These results can be broadly applied for effective piezoelectric response calculations in thin piezoelectric and ferroelectric films as well as surface polar layers e.g. in organic materials and bio-polymers. In particular, the effective piezoresponse strongly decreases with film thickness whereas the sharpness of domain stripes image increases due to the object transfer function spectrum broadening.

D2-42	In order to determine how much Vitamin D supplement to take, you first need to find out what your current Vitamin D level is. You determine the level of vitamin D by doing a blood test for 25 (OH) vitamin D. That’s 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Most experts agree that a level of 32 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) in the blood is optimal for bone health but no one agrees on what is optimal for immune health, heart health, cancer health and all the other important functions that vitamin D appears to have. Your skin, where vitamin D is made, has a wonderful system for making the right amount, then shutting off further production.

539	Proposed by Wolfgang Pauli more than 80 years ago, the exclusion principle has been proven to have a far-reaching consequence, from femtoscopic world to macroscopic, super-dense, and fully relativistic physics. Starting from this principle, we discuss two interesting research topics, which have currently drawn considerable attention in the nuclear- and astrophysics communities; the hypernuclear and neutron star physics. Special attention is given to the electromagnetic production of the hypertriton and the consequences of the neutrino electromagnetic properties in dense matter. We also touch on the new arena which could also be fascinating for physicists; the econophysics.

2579	We propose a novel experimental probe for cold atomic gases analogous to the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) in condensed matter. This probe uses the coherent coupling of a single particle to the system. Depending on the measurement sequence, our probe allows to either obtain the \emph{local} density, with a resolution on the nanometer scale, or the single particle correlation function in real time. We discuss applications of this scheme to the various possible phases for a two dimensional Hubbard system of fermions in an optical lattice.

The significant outcome of this research is that the proposed optimum linear LLR calculation method can achieve better decoding performance in fading channels with reduced computational complexity, making it suitable for practical applications that require high data rates and low latency.
4049	"Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two, W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2). An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the ""classical"" subsets answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2)."
3011	We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use a projection (fractional-step) method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In particular, we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from it the stability of the scheme.
1674	We determine the instanton corrected hypermultiplet moduli space in type IIB compactifications near a Calabi-Yau conifold point where the size of a two-cycle shrinks to zero. We show that D1-instantons resolve the conifold singularity caused by worldsheet instantons. Furthermore, by resumming the instanton series, we reproduce exactly the results obtained by Ooguri and Vafa on the type IIA side, where membrane instantons correct the hypermultiplet moduli space. Our calculations therefore establish that mirror symmetry holds non-perturbatively in the string coupling.
3274	This research paper explores the relationship between quasi-ordinary singularities, essential divisors, and Poincare series. The authors define and analyze essential divisors, which provide a way to decompose a singular variety into simpler pieces. They then use Poincare series to study the behavior of various invariants of the singular variety, such as cohomology and intersection theory. The main conclusion of the paper is that essential divisors and Poincare series provide powerful tools for understanding the geometry and topology of singular varieties.
2107	This research paper investigates the origin of very high energy gamma rays observed from supernova remnants and their implications for the interstellar radiation field in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), the study shows that these gamma rays are likely produced through the interaction of accelerated particles with the interstellar medium. The results also provide new constraints on the intensity and spectrum of the interstellar radiation field, which is an important factor in understanding the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the complex processes involved in the evolution of supernova remnants and the interstellar medium, with important implications for high-energy astrophysics and particle physics.
931	The efficiency of path sampling simulations can be improved considerably using the approach of path swapping. For this purpose, we have devised a new algorithmic procedure based on the transition interface sampling technique. In the same spirit of parallel tempering, paths between different ensembles are swapped, but the role of temperature is here played by the interface position. We have tested the method on the denaturation transition of DNA using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. We find that the new algorithm gives a reduction of the computational cost by a factor 20.
3776	"The research paper titled ""Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic shocks"" investigates the behavior of high-energy particles interacting with relativistic shocks. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate that particle acceleration and radiation losses are closely linked, resulting in a cut-off energy for the particles. The paper also shows that the cut-off energy is determined by the shock velocity and magnetic field strength. The research findings have implications for understanding the origin of cosmic rays and the acceleration of particles in astrophysical environments. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering radiative losses in modeling particle acceleration at relativistic shocks."

The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of generalized entropy measures in interdisciplinary research and their potential for developing novel approaches to complex system analysis.
1408	This research paper delves into the 1874 controversy between the French mathematician Camille Jordan and the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker. At the heart of the debate was the question of the foundations of mathematics, specifically the use of infinite sets and their role in mathematical reasoning. Jordan argued for the validity of infinite sets and their importance in mathematical analysis, while Kronecker maintained that only finite sets and their operations should be considered legitimate in mathematics. The paper examines the arguments made by both mathematicians and the broader implications of this controversy for the development of mathematics in the late 19th century. Ultimately, the paper suggests that the debate between Jordan and Kronecker highlights the tension between the abstract and concrete approaches to mathematics, a tension that continues to shape mathematical inquiry today.
3368	This research paper investigates the light curves of supernovae resulting from fallback gamma-ray bursts. The study uses numerical simulations to calculate the light curves of various models and compares the results with observations of actual supernovae. The paper concludes that the fallback gamma-ray burst mechanism can explain the diverse light curves of supernovae and provides insights into the properties of the surrounding circumstellar material. These findings have significant implications for understanding the physics of supernovae and the role of gamma-ray bursts in their evolution.
2847	We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuum process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC) layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold friction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves are obtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. The obtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growth temperature.
1762	"We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr\""odinger equation."
2791	We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts. First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then, the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to previous studies.
2110	A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0.001.
2013	The Fixed Phase Quantum Search Algorithm (FPQSA) is a novel approach to the well-known Grover's search algorithm. In this paper, we present the concept of FPQSA and demonstrate its potential advantages over the standard Grover's algorithm. We show that the FPQSA can achieve a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, and can be implemented with a fixed phase that is independent of the number of search items. We provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in various scenarios, including the case of multiple marked items, and compare it with other quantum search algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the FPQSA has the potential to be a useful and efficient tool in quantum information processing and quantum computing applications.
3298	This research paper presents a rigorous path integral approach to solve supersymmetric quantum mechanics problems and to calculate the heat kernel. The method is based on the supersymmetric extension of the Feynman-Kac formula and the associated bosonic and fermionic coherent states. The authors show that the path integral is well-defined and can be expressed in terms of the heat kernel. They also demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to a simple example of a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator and comparing the results with the standard supersymmetric algebraic method. This new path integral approach provides a powerful tool for solving supersymmetric quantum mechanics problems and exploring their physical implications.
2059	The concept of the scalar graviton as the source of the dark matter and dark energy of the gravitaional origin is applied to study the evolution of the isotropic homogeneous Universe. A realistic self-consistent solution to the modified pure gravity equations, which correctly describes the accelerated expansion of the spatially flat Universe, is found and investigated. It is argued that the scenario with the scalar gravitons filling up the Universe may emulate the LCDM model, reducing thus the true dark matter to an artefact.
2111	This research paper focuses on the implementation of a Gauss convoluted Pandel probability density function (PDF) for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes. The PDF is used to estimate the track direction and energy of neutrino-induced muons. The proposed method is compared with other reconstruction methods and is found to have better performance in terms of accuracy and resolution. The study also shows that the method is robust and can handle high levels of background noise. The outcomes of the study suggest that the Gauss convoluted Pandel PDF can be a useful tool for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes, leading to improved neutrino detection and identification.
1517	This research paper aims to provide a new perspective on the study of defects in materials, specifically disclinations, dislocations, and continuous defects. The authors revisit the fundamental concepts and definitions of these defects and explore their properties and behavior in various materials. The paper also discusses the current state of research in the field and identifies areas that require further investigation. The key findings of this study include a thorough understanding of the relationship between disclinations and dislocations, as well as the role of continuous defects in material deformation. The authors conclude that a comprehensive understanding of these defects is crucial for the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties.
1229	Given a solution of a nonlinear wave equation on the flat space-time (with a real analytic nonlinearity), we relate its Cauchy data at two different times by nonlinear representation formulas in terms of asymptotic series. We first show how to construct formally these series by mean of generating functions based on an algebraic framework inspired by the construction of Fock spaces in quantum field theory. Then we build an analytic setting in which all these constructions really make sense and give rise to convergent series.
3913	The research paper investigates the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators. The main points of the paper include the definition and properties of pseudospectrum, the construction of elliptic quadratic differential operators, and the analysis of their pseudospectrum. The paper provides several noteworthy findings, including the fact that the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators can be characterized in terms of the eigenvalues of a related operator. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the study of elliptic quadratic differential operators and their applications in various fields of mathematics and physics.
4030	This research paper investigates the possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03. The soft-excess emission has been observed in the X-ray spectrum of the cluster and is believed to be associated with the intracluster medium. The study aims to analyze the X-ray data to determine whether the soft-excess emission is of thermal or non-thermal origin. The research findings suggest that the soft-excess emission is likely non-thermal in nature, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the cluster's evolution and the physical processes that drive X-ray emission. The results of this study could help pave the way for future research in the field and provide new insights into the nature of galaxy clusters and their properties.
377	Direct photon production is an important observable in heavy ion collisions as photons are penetrating and therefore largely insensetive to final state effects that lead to jet quenching. Measurements of the fragmentation component to prompt photon yields in p+p and Au+Au collisions will provide both an important test of pQCD predictions and of predictions for modifications of this component in heavy ion collisions. By selecting photons associated with jets on the near side using hadron-photon correlations, fragmentation photons can be measured directly.
649	"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestr""om-Kakeya theorem."
1207	This research paper explores the detection of 658 GHz vibrationally-excited water masers using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The study aims to understand the physical properties and dynamics of the maser emission in the context of star-forming regions and active galactic nuclei. The observations were carried out using the SMA, a state-of-the-art radio interferometer located in Hawaii, and the analysis was performed using advanced data reduction and modeling techniques. The results demonstrate the high sensitivity and resolution of the SMA in detecting and characterizing the maser emission, providing valuable insights into the processes that drive the formation and evolution of galaxies and stars. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for future observational studies of maser emission and their role in astrophysical processes.
833	We perform a non-perturbative sum over geometries in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity model given in terms of Causal Dynamical Triangulations. Inspired by the concept of triangulations of product type introduced previously, we impose an additional notion of order on the discrete, causal geometries. This simplifies the combinatorial problem of counting geometries just enough to enable us to calculate the transfer matrix between boundary states labelled by the area of the spatial universe, as well as the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian of the continuum theory. This is the first time in dimension larger than two that a Hamiltonian has been derived from such a model by mainly analytical means, and opens the way for a better understanding of scaling and renormalization issues.
428	This research paper explores the concept of different vacua in the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), a widely studied model in particle physics that predicts the existence of two Higgs doublets. The paper investigates the potential existence of different vacua in the 2HDM, which could have significant implications for the properties of the Higgs boson and the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the paper demonstrates that the presence of different vacua in the 2HDM is indeed possible, and discusses the potential consequences of this phenomenon. The findings of this research highlight the importance of further investigation into the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and the properties of the Higgs boson in the 2HDM.
231	In the purely affine formulation of gravity, the gravitational field is represented by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor of the affine connection. The classical electromagnetic field can be represented in this formulation by the second Ricci tensor of the connection. Such a construction is dynamically equivalent to the sourceless Einstein-Maxwell equations. We generalize this construction to the case with sources, represented by the derivative of the affine Lagrangian density with respect to the connection. We show that the Maxwell equations with sources emerge for the simplest affine Lagrangian for matter, while the Einstein and Lorentz equations arise if mass has electromagnetic origin. We also show that the Maxwell equations replace the unphysical constraint imposed by the projective invariance of purely affine Lagrangians that depend explicitly on the connection.
22	Using operator algebraic methods we show that the moment generating function of charge transport in a system with infinitely many non-interacting Fermions is given by a determinant of a certain operator in the one-particle Hilbert space. The formula is equivalent to a formula of Levitov and Lesovik in the finite dimensional case and may be viewed as its regularized form in general. Our result embodies two tenets often realized in mesoscopic physics, namely, that the transport properties are essentially independent of the length of the leads and of the depth of the Fermi sea.
2614	The research paper explores how the language used in physics affects student learning. The main subject of the paper is the use of conceptual metaphor and functional grammar to analyze the language used in physics textbooks and lectures. The paper emphasizes the key findings and conclusions, which suggest that the language used in physics can have a significant impact on student learning. Specifically, the use of abstract language and complex sentence structures can make it difficult for students to understand the concepts being taught. The paper recommends that physics teachers use more concrete language and simpler sentence structures to enhance student learning.
2761	We show that r-mode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond pulsars are rare.
1519	"The research paper titled ""Effective spin systems in coupled micro-cavities"" aims to investigate the behavior of effective spin systems in coupled micro-cavities. The authors analyze the interaction between two cavities, each containing a single quantum emitter, and observe the emergence of effective spin systems in the coupled system. They show that the effective spin systems exhibit rich dynamics, including coherent oscillations, entanglement, and quantum state transfer. The authors also explore the effects of dissipation and decoherence on the system and demonstrate that the effective spin systems remain robust in the presence of these effects. The paper concludes that coupled micro-cavities provide a promising platform for the realization of effective spin systems with potential applications in quantum information processing and communication."
D1-3	Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.
638	In this study, using the analytical and recurrence relations suggested by the authors in previous works, the new efficient and reliable program procedure for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals (STOs) is presented. The proposed procedure guarantees a highly accurate evaluation of the overlap integrals with arbitrary values of quantum numbers, screening constants and internuclear distances. It is demonstrated that the computational accuracy of the proposed procedure is not only dependent on the efficiency of formulas, as has been discussed previously, but also on a number of other factors including the used program language package and solvent properties. The numerical results obtained using the algorithm described in the present work are in a complete agreement with those obtained using the alternative evaluation procedure. We notice that the program works without any restrictions and in all range of integral parameters.
3045	This research paper investigates the two-scale structure of the electron dissipation region (EDR) during collisionless magnetic reconnection. The main objective is to understand the physical processes that occur within the EDR and their implications for magnetic reconnection. Using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, the authors find that the EDR has a distinct two-scale structure, consisting of a large-scale electron diffusion region and a small-scale electron-scale current layer. They also observe that the electron-scale current layer is much thinner than previously thought, with a thickness on the order of the electron skin depth. These findings suggest that the EDR plays a crucial role in the acceleration and heating of electrons during magnetic reconnection.
293	The method for determination of the Supernovae (SNe) explosions frequency distribution function based on the assumption of explosions independence are offered. The method is based on assumption that the sequence of SNe explosions in an individual galaxy is a Poisson sequence. The essence of the method is in the determination of statistical moments of the frequency of the SNe explosions and subsequent determination of distribution function . The program of numerical simulation has been developed for testing the efficiency of the method. Numerical simulations show that even for a small mean number of registered SNe explosions, method allows restoring initial distribution function. The results of numerical simulations are given.
2212	We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.
1943	This research paper focuses on the development of a new mathematical tool called the dual Feynman transform for modular operads. The main aim of this study is to provide a rigorous framework for the study of modular operads, which are algebraic structures that describe symmetries in mathematical objects. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the dual Feynman transform, its properties, and its applications in the context of modular operads. The crucial finding of this research is that the dual Feynman transform is a powerful tool for studying modular operads, and it allows for the computation of important quantities such as quantum invariants. The paper concludes by discussing the potential future directions of research in this area, and the impact of the dual Feynman transform on the broader field of algebraic geometry and topology.
1162	We study spin-polarized transient transport in a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads subjected to a rectangular bias voltage pulse. Time-dependent spin-resolved currents, occupations, spin accumulation, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated using both nonequilibrium Green function and master equation techniques. Both parallel and antiparallel leads' magnetization alignments are analyzed. Our main findings are: a dynamical spin accumulation that changes sign in time, a short-lived pulse of spin polarized current in the emitter lead (but not in the collector lead), and a dynamical TMR that develops negative values in the transient regime. We also observe that the intra-dot Coulomb interaction can enhance even further the negative values of the TMR.
194	Coherent Harmonic Generation (CHG), and in particular Nonlinear Harmonic Generation (NHG), is of importance for both short wavelength Free-Electron Lasers (FELs), in relation with the achievement of shorter wavelengths with a fixed electron-beam energy, and high-average power FEL resonators, in relation with destructive effects of higher harmonics radiation on mirrors. In this paper we present a treatment of NHG from helical wigglers with particular emphasis on the second harmonic. Our study is based on an exact analytical solution of Maxwell's equations, derived with the help of a Green's function method. In particular, we demonstrate that nonlinear harmonic generation (NHG) from helical wigglers vanishes on axis. Our conclusion is in open contrast with results in literature, that include a kinematical mistake in the description of the electron motion.
345	"The research paper titled ""Observing the gas temperature drop in the high-density nucleus of L 1544"" focuses on analyzing the temperature distribution in the nucleus of the L1544 molecular cloud using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The results of the study show that the gas temperature in the high-density region drops by a factor of two, which can be explained by the depletion of gas-phase CO molecules onto dust grains. This phenomenon is significant as it suggests that chemical and physical processes are tightly coupled in molecular clouds, affecting their evolution and star formation potential. The study highlights the importance of observing temperature gradients in molecular clouds to better understand their internal dynamics and evolution."
2331	The general relativity is the base for any exact evolutionary theory of large scale structures. We calculate the universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations of gravitational field in general relativity. Based on the equations, the evolutions of disk nebula are discussed. A system of nebula can form binary stars or single star for different conditions. While any simplified linear theory forms only a single star system. It is proved that the nonlinear interactions are very general, so the binary stars are also common.
201	A very compact architecture has been developed for the first level Muon Trigger of the LHCb experiment that processes 40 millions of proton-proton collisions per second.

The method presented in this paper is useful for studying the properties of evolved stars and can be applied to other stellar populations.

2771	The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential applications of SWCNTs in various fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and biomedicine, and highlights the importance of understanding their optical properties for the development of novel technologies. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the absorption spectroscopy of individual SWCNTs and its implications for future research in this exciting field.

This research sheds new light on the fundamental physics of electron emission from nanoscale conductors and has important implications for the design of future electronic devices.

398	The quiet Sun has been a topic of interest for solar physicists for decades. Recent studies have shown a discrepancy in G-band contrast measurements, indicating that the quiet Sun may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. In this research paper, we investigate this discrepancy in G-band contrast and explore possible explanations for the observed variations. Using high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyze G-band contrast in different regions of the quiet Sun. Our results suggest that the discrepancy in G-band contrast is related to the presence of small-scale magnetic fields and their interaction with convective motions. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the quiet Sun's magnetic field and its role in the Sun's activity cycle.
590	We propose two Type-II seesaw scenarios for the neutrino mass matrix in the left-right symmetric model, in which the Higgs triplet Yukawa coupling matrix takes the appealing Friedberg-Lee texture. We show that the nearly tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern, which is especially favored by current neutrino oscillation data, can be obtained from both scenarios. We also show that the cosmological baryon number asymmetry can naturally be interpreted in these two scenarios via the flavor-independent leptogenesis mechanism.

The results show that the smaller, less massive component is hotter than the larger, more massive component, which is contrary to the expected temperature difference in such binaries. This discovery challenges current models of brown-dwarf formation and evolution and can have significant implications for our understanding of these objects.

257	We propose a method of manipulating selectively the symmetric Dicke subspace in the internal degrees of freedom of N trapped ions. We show that the direct access to ionic-motional subspaces, based on a suitable tuning of motion-dependent AC Stark shifts, induces a two-level dynamics involving previously selected ionic Dicke states. In this manner, it is possible to produce, sequentially and unitarily, ionic Dicke states with increasing excitation number. Moreover, we propose a probabilistic technique to produce directly any ionic Dicke state assuming suitable initial conditions.

The paper concludes that the LB-IKM approach is a promising tool for simulating turbulent flows and offers a new perspective on the relationship between turbulence and the underlying kinetic theory.
D1-16	General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is a geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It provides a unified description of gravity as a property of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional continuum combining space and time. The theory posits that massive objects cause a curvature in spacetime, and this curvature influences the motion of objects, effectively manifesting as gravity. Einstein developed general relativity to address limitations in Newton's law of universal gravitation, particularly in explaining anomalies like the precession of Mercury's orbit. The theory has been extensively tested and confirmed through observations of gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects, and the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields
2460	We report on FUSE spectra of three U Gem-type, long period, dwarf novae, UU Aql, BV Cen and CH UMa taken during their quiescence intervals. We discuss the line identifications in their spectra and attempt to characterize the source(s) of their FUV flux distribution. Archival IUE spectrum of CH UMa and BV Cen in quiescence were identified as having a matching flux level with the FUSE spectra and these were combined with each FUSE spectrum to broaden the wavelength coverage and further constrain model fits. Multi-component synthetic spectral fits from our model grids, consisting of single temperature white dwarfs, two-temperature white dwarfs, accretion disks and white dwarfs plus accretion disks, were applied to the FUSE spectra alone and to the combined FUSE + IUE spectra. We present the results of our model analyses and their implications.

The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, which can be used to solve other quantum mechanical problems efficiently. The conclusion of the study is that the finite element method is a promising approach for solving the Schroedinger equation.
1898	The electronic structure of the quasi-lowdimensional vanadium sulfide \bavs3 is investigated for the different phases above the magnetic ordering temperature. By means of density functional theory and its combination with dynamical-mean field theory, we follow the evolution of the relevant low-energy electronic states on cooling. Hence we go in the metallic regime from the room temperature hexagonal phase to the orthorhombic phase after the first structural transition, and close with the monoclinic insulating phase below the metal-insulator transition. Due to the low symmetry and expected intersite correlations, the latter phase is treated within cellular dynamical mean-field theory. It is generally discussed how the intriguing interplay between band-structure and strong-correlation effects leads to the stabilization of the various electronic phases with decreasing temperature.

Using data collected by the LHCb experiment, the paper analyzes the branching fractions and angular distributions of two-body B-meson decays involving Ds0*(2317) and Ds1(2460) mesons. The results provide new insights into the properties of these mesons and their contribution to B-meson decays.

The study utilizes the Newman-Penrose formalism to derive the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field and investigates the energy distribution in the presence of a black hole charge. The results show that the presence of the charge significantly affects the energy distribution, leading to a shift in the location of the energy peak. Moreover, the study finds that the scalar field's energy density decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. These findings have significant implications for understanding the behavior of charged black holes and their interactions with scalar fields.
3945	This research paper aims to extend the theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in quasi-2D systems. The main objectives of the study are to investigate the role of electron-phonon coupling, anisotropy, and dimensionality in the superconducting properties of quasi-2D materials, and to examine the validity of the Migdal-Eliashberg theory in this context. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength and the anisotropy of the phonon spectrum play crucial roles in determining the superconducting transition temperature and the nature of the superconducting state. We also demonstrate that the Migdal-Eliashberg theory provides a reliable description of the superconducting properties of quasi-2D materials, despite the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation. Our findings have important implications for the design and optimization of superconducting devices based on quasi-2D materials.
329	It is widely acknowledged that good object clustering is critical to the performance of object-oriented databases. However, object clustering always involves some kind of overhead for the system. The aim of this paper is to propose a modelling methodology in order to evaluate the performances of different clustering policies. This methodology has been used to compare the performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering overhead.

Moreover, the observed correlations between the produced particles provide insight into the underlying physics of the collision. The study highlights the importance of understanding the production of Anticentauro events in the search for new forms of matter in high-energy physics.
81	An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th/0609202, and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in (2+1)-dimensional AdS.
1257	A previously unknown effect-giant spatial redistribution of the electric field strength in a crystal under illumination of the structure - was discovered and investigated in real photoresistors on high-resistivity (semi-insulating) semiconductor CdTe crystals (in metal-thin insulator- semiconductor-thin insulator -metal structures). A new concept is proposed for photoelectric phenomena in high- resistivity semiconductor crystals. The concept is based on the idea that the redistribution of the field under such conditions that the carrier lifetime remains unchanged under illumination plays a determining role in these phenomena. The nature of the effect is described, the dependence of the characteristics of the structures on the parameters of the crystal and the insulator layers is explained by the manifestation of this effect, and ways to produce structures with prescribed photoelectric characteristics for new devices and scientific methods are examined.
2508	When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing, \lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles.
1564	This research paper investigates the synchrotron radio emission from a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME). The study employs radio observations from the Owens Valley Solar Array to analyze the radio emission from the CME at various frequencies. The analysis reveals that the radio emission is consistent with synchrotron emission, indicating the presence of energetic electrons in the CME. The study also suggests that the CME's magnetic field is not uniform, which could be responsible for the observed radio emission. These results provide important insights into the nature of fast halo CMEs and their associated radio emission.
2190	We investigate one of the consequences of the twisted Poincare symmetry. We derive the charge conservation law and show that the equivalence principle is satisfied in the canonical noncommutative spacetime. We applied the twisted Poincare symmetry to the Weinberg's analysis. To this end, we generalize our earlier construction of the twisted S matrix \cite{Bu}, which apply the noncommutativity to the fourier modes, to the massless fields of integer spins. The transformation formula for the twisted S matrix for the massless fields of integer spin has been obtained. For massless fields of spin 1, we obtain the conservation of charge, and the universality of coupling constant for massless fields of spin 2, which can be interpreted as the equality of gravitational mass and inertial mass, i.e., the equivalence principle.

1452	In this contribution I will attempt to show that the study of galactic 6.7 and 12.2GHz methanol masers themselves, as opposed to the use of methanol masers as signposts, can yield important conclusions contributing to the understanding of high-mass star formation. Due to their exclusive association with star formation, methanol masers are the best tools to do this, and their large number allows to probe the entire Galaxy. In particular I will focus on the determination of the luminosity function of methanol masers and on the determination of an unambiguous signature for a circumstellar masing disc seen edge-on. Finally I will try to point out some future fields of research in the study of methanol masers.

1959	We study the consequences of CPT and lepton number violation in neutrino sector. For CPT violation we take gravity with which neutrino and antineutrino couple differently. Gravity mixes neutrino and antineutrino in an unequal ratio to give two mass eigenstates. Lepton number violation interaction together with CPT violation gives rise to neutrino-antineutrino oscillation. Subsequently, we study the neutrino flavor mixing and oscillation under the influence of gravity. It is found that gravity changes flavor oscillation significantly which influences the relative abundance of different flavors in present universe. We show that the neutrinoless double beta decay rate is modified due to presence of gravity- the origin of CPT violation, as the mass of the flavor state is modified.

338	The birefringence phenomenon in the vacuum with a constant magnetic background of arbitrary strength is considered within the framework of the effective action approach. A new feature of the birefringence in a magnetized vacuum is that the parallel mode, which is polarized parallel to the plane containing the magnetic field and the photon wave vector, is no longer transverse. We have studied this feature in detail for arbitrary magnetic field and provided analytic results for the ultra-strong magnetic field regime. Possible physical implications of our results in astrophysics are discussed.
2865	The research paper analyzes the relationship between yield curve shapes and the asymptotic short rate distribution in affine one-factor models. The authors establish a connection between the shape of the yield curve and the distribution of the short rate, showing that the distribution of the short rate is intimately related to the level and slope of the yield curve. They also demonstrate that the tails of the short rate distribution are determined by the curvature of the yield curve. The findings have important implications for the pricing of interest rate derivatives and risk management. The study concludes by suggesting that the shape of the yield curve should be taken into account when modeling the dynamics of the short rate.
2870	We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures, antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition, these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered structures.
664	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of over-reflection and the generation of Gravito-Alfven waves in solar-type stars. Through numerical simulations and analysis of observational data, we show that over-reflection can occur in the outer layers of the stars, leading to the formation of Gravito-Alfven waves. These waves can play an important role in the dynamics and energy transport of the stellar atmosphere. We also discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the evolution and activity of solar-type stars. Our results suggest that Gravito-Alfven waves may be a common feature of these stars and could be a key factor in the heating of their outer atmospheres.

The primary focus of the paper is to investigate the chaotic behavior of the system and to identify the conditions under which chaos occurs. The authors use numerical simulations and analytical techniques to study the behavior of the system, and they find that chaos can arise under certain parameter regimes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for our understanding of the dynamics of charged particles in magnetic fields."
1007	The paper investigates how external regulation affects the dynamics of random Boolean networks. The researchers find that the addition of external regulation can induce asynchronous dynamics, where nodes in the network behave independently, rather than synchronously. This can lead to increased complexity in the network's behavior. Additionally, they demonstrate that the propagation of external regulation is affected by the topology of the network, with certain types of networks exhibiting more efficient propagation. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of complex systems and designing effective control strategies.
798	This research paper investigates the baryon asymmetry problem in a heavy moduli scenario. We analyze the effective potential of the Higgs field and its role in generating a non-zero baryon number. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, we demonstrate that a heavy moduli field can lead to an efficient generation of baryon number asymmetry. Our results suggest that this scenario can provide a viable solution to the baryon asymmetry problem in the early universe. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of heavy moduli fields in understanding the origin of matter in the universe.
2938	The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters, namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient. Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.
10	"It is proved that every knot in the major subfamilies of J. Berge's lens space surgery (i.e., knots yielding a lens space by Dehn surgery) is presented by an L-shaped (real) plane curve as a ""divide knot"" defined by N. A'Campo in the context of singularity theory of complex curves. For each knot given by Berge's parameters, the corresponding plane curve is constructed. The surgery coefficients are also considered. Such presentations support us to study each knot itself, and the relationship among the knots in the set of lens space surgeries."
718	This research paper explores the electronic properties of eumelanin monomers and dimers through theoretical modeling and spectroscopy techniques. The study finds that eumelanin exhibits unique electronic properties, including a large excited-state dipole moment and the ability to efficiently absorb and dissipate energy. Additionally, the research reveals that eumelanin dimers have a stronger electronic coupling than monomers, leading to enhanced energy transfer and potentially important implications for the material's functionality. Overall, this research sheds light on the fundamental electronic properties of eumelanin and its potential applications in fields such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.
286	We elucidate how black holes form in trans-Planckian collisions. In the rest frame of one of the incident particles, the gravitational field of the other, which is rapidly moving, looks like a gravitational shock wave. The shock wave focuses the target particle down to a much smaller impact parameter. In turn, the gravitational field of the target particle captures the projectile when the resultant impact parameter is smaller than its own Schwarzschild radius, forming a black hole. One can deduce this by referring to the original argument of escape velocities exceeding the speed of light, which Michell and Laplace used to discover the existence of black holes.
2677	This research paper focuses on the application of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the momentum distributions of non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) in strong laser fields. Specifically, the product phase approximation is utilized to calculate the momentum distributions of the two electrons that are ionized simultaneously. The results suggest that the product phase approximation can accurately capture the NSDI momentum distributions and that the momentum correlations between the two electrons play a crucial role in shaping the distributions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the NSDI process and highlights the importance of considering electron-electron correlations in TDDFT calculations.
3971	This research paper presents a thermodynamic model for the melting of supported metal nanoparticles. The model is based on the classical thermodynamic theory of phase transitions and includes the effects of particle size, shape, and support interaction. The model is used to investigate the melting behavior of gold and nickel nanoparticles supported on different substrates. The results show that the melting temperature of the nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their size and shape, as well as the nature of the substrate. The model provides a useful tool for predicting the melting behavior of metal nanoparticles and can be extended to other supported nanoscale systems.
1435	This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for them actively.
2143	"Using the previously derived confining gluon propagator, the corresponding system of equations determining the quark propagator is derived. The system of equations consists of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator itself, which includes the zero momentum transfer quark-gluon vertex. It is complemented by the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this vertex. The quark equation depends explicitly on the mass gap, determining the scale of the truly nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state. The obtained system of equations is manifestly gauge-invariant, i.e., does not depend explicitly on the gauge-fixing parameter. It is also free from all the types of the perturbative contributions (""contaminations""), which may appear at the fundamental quark-gluon level."
3617	This research paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of subthreshold oscillatory behaviors in nonlinear autonomous systems. The authors investigate the conditions under which such oscillations can occur and the relationship between the system's parameters and the characteristics of the oscillations. They also explore the dynamics of the system near the onset of oscillations and demonstrate that the system's response to perturbations can change significantly as it approaches the oscillation threshold. The authors conclude that their analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of nonlinear autonomous systems, which can be useful in a wide range of applications, from neuroscience to electronics.
840	The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level, where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups. Our findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under tension.
1339	We systematically evaluate the potential energy at the touching configuration for heavy-ion reactions using various potential models. We point out that the energy at the touching point, especially that estimated with the Krappe-Nix-Sierk (KNS) potential, strongly correlates with the threshold incident energy for steep fall-off of fusion cross sections observed recently for several systems at extremely low energies. This clearly indicates that the steep fall-off phenomenon can be attributed to the dynamics after the target and projectile touch with each other, e.g., the tunneling process and the nuclear saturation property in the overlap region.
2357	This research paper presents a method for mathematically combining two Lorentz boosts through spatial and space-time rotations in a specific order. The resulting Lorentz transformation can be used to describe the motion of particles in relativistic physics. The authors show that this ordered addition of boosts can be simplified by using a specific rotation matrix. The findings of this study have implications for understanding the behavior of particles in high-energy physics and for improving the accuracy of calculations in relativistic systems.
2310	The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.
3015	We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities, the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties are determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three- and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the four-particle ring exchange.
3903	The research paper investigates the impact of node deletion on the structure of complex networks. Through simulations on various network models, the study reveals that the removal of a small number of highly connected nodes can lead to a significant disruption in network connectivity and increase network vulnerability. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the rate of network collapse is dependent on the network's initial structure and the deletion strategy employed. These results have important implications for network design and management, particularly in fields such as transportation, communication, and social networks.
3364	"The research paper titled ""On Certain Quantization Aspects of (Generalized) Toda Systems"" explores the quantum aspects of Toda systems and their generalizations. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the quantization of Toda systems and the relationship between classical and quantum integrability. The indispensable findings of the research are the discovery of new quantum integrable structures related to Toda systems, the quantization of Toda lattices, and the identification of quantum Toda systems as natural quantum deformations of classical Toda systems. The paper concludes that the study of quantization aspects of Toda systems could provide new insights into the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and their relationship to classical mechanics."
1438	We present calculations of the thermal and electric linear response in graphene, including disorder in the self-consistent t-matrix approximation. For strong impurity scattering, near the unitary limit, the formation of a band of impurity states near the Fermi level leads to that Mott's relation holds at low temperature. For higher temperatures, there are strong deviations due to the linear density of states. The low-temperature thermopower is proportional to the inverse of the impurity potential and the inverse of the impurity density. Information about impurity scattering in graphene can be extracted from the thermopower, either measured directly, or extracted via Mott's relation from the electron-density dependence of the electric conductivity.
481	We study ion condensation onto a patterned surface of alternating charges. The competition between self-energy and ion-surface interactions leads to the formation of ionic crystalline structures at low temperatures. We consider different arrangements of underlying ionic crystals, including single ion adsorption, as well as the formation of dipoles at the interface between charged domains. Molecular dynamic simulation illustrates existence of single and mixed phases. Our results contribute to understanding pattern recognition, and molecular separation and synthesis near patterned surfaces.
1609	The research paper presents a new chaotic attractor in a multi-strain epidemiological model that incorporates temporary cross-immunity. The model considers the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of a disease in a population and the temporary immunity that arises from exposure to one strain. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the existence of a chaotic attractor in the model with temporary cross-immunity. The results show that the chaotic behavior can arise due to the interaction between the cross-immunity and the transmission dynamics of the disease. The study concludes that the new chaotic attractor has important implications for understanding the dynamics of multiple strains of a disease and highlights the need for further research in this area.
3381	"The research paper titled ""Nonholonomic Ricci Flows: Exact Solutions and Gravity"" explores the behavior of nonholonomic Ricci flows in the context of gravity. The authors investigate exact solutions of the nonholonomic Ricci flow equation and their implications for gravitational theories. They demonstrate that nonholonomic Ricci flows can be used to study the dynamics of spacetime in the presence of matter and energy. The paper also discusses the potential applications of these findings in cosmology and astrophysics. The main conclusion of the paper is that nonholonomic Ricci flows provide a powerful tool for understanding the complex dynamics of gravity and the evolution of spacetime."
4004	"The research paper titled ""Quantum Electromagnetic X-Waves"" explores the generation and propagation of X-waves in the context of quantum electromagnetic systems. The main theme of the paper is to investigate the behavior of X-waves in the quantum regime and to analyze their potential applications in various fields of physics and engineering. The paper presents noteworthy results in the form of analytical and numerical solutions of the Schr dinger and Maxwell equations for X-wave propagation. The paper also discusses the potential applications of X-waves in quantum information processing, imaging, and communications. The research concludes that X-waves have promising potential in quantum technologies and could lead to significant improvements in various fields."
3110	This research paper explores the use of non-linear methods, specifically fractal and recurrence quantification analysis, to investigate new possible properties of atomic nuclei. The study highlights the potential of these methods in providing a deeper understanding of the complex behavior of atomic nuclei. Noteworthy results include the identification of previously unknown correlations between nuclear properties and the fractal dimension, as well as the discovery of new patterns in the recurrence plots of nuclear data. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued exploration of non-linear methods in nuclear physics research.
1429	"We discuss in this paper two ways of defining the concept of ""effective field theory"": effective field theory defined by low energy effectiveness and effective field theory defined by 4D effectiveness out of higher dimensions. We argue that these two views are actually equivalent, that effective field theories at low energy can in fact be regarded as field theories of higher dimensions confined on a 4D spcaetime. We examine this idea through comparing two different regularization schemes: Momentum Cutoff and Dimensional Regularization, and through analyzing how fields can be localized on branes."
2507	This research paper investigates the deviation of the vacuum refractive index induced by a static gravitational field. The study uses the framework of general relativity to derive the equation for the refractive index deviation and investigates its behavior in different conditions. The critical outcomes of the research show that the refractive index deviation is proportional to the gravitational field strength and the distance from the source of the field. The study also highlights the potential applications of the refractive index deviation in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. The conclusions of the research suggest that the refractive index deviation can be used as a tool for observing and analyzing the properties of gravitational fields and their effects on light propagation.
291	"Edge casing is a well-known method to improve the readability of drawings of non-planar graphs. A cased drawing orders the edges of each edge crossing and interrupts the lower edge in an appropriate neighborhood of the crossing. Certain orders will lead to a more readable drawing than others. We formulate several optimization criteria that try to capture the concept of a ""good"" cased drawing. Further, we address the algorithmic question of how to turn a given drawing into an optimal cased drawing. For many of the resulting optimization problems, we either find polynomial time algorithms or NP-hardness results."
2627	SkyMapper is amongst the first of a new generation of dedicated, wide-field survey telescopes. The 1.3m SkyMapper telescope features a 5.7 square degree field-of-view Cassegrain imager and will see first light in late 2007. The primary goal of the facility is to conduct the Southern Sky Survey a six colour, six epoch survey of the southern sky. The survey will provide photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.
2406	We apply quantum filtering and control to a particle in a harmonic trap under continuous position measurement, and show that a simple static feedback law can be used to cool the system. The final steady state is Gaussian and dependent on the feedback strength and coupling between the system and probe. In the limit of weak coupling this final state becomes the ground state. An earlier model by Haine et. al. (PRA 69, 2004) without measurement back-action showed dark states: states that did not display error signals, thus remaining unaffected by the control. This paper shows that for a realistic measurement process this is not true, which indicates that a Bose-Einstein condensate may be driven towards the ground state from any arbitrary initial state.
3356	This research paper investigates the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on quantum coherence in a differential charge qubit. By analyzing the behavior of the qubit under various conditions, we observe that quasiparticle poisoning can significantly degrade the coherence of the system. Our results show that the coherence time of the qubit decreases exponentially with increasing quasiparticle density. Furthermore, we find that the impact of quasiparticle poisoning is more severe in the case of the differential charge qubit compared to the standard charge qubit. This study provides valuable insights into the sources of decoherence in quantum systems and highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of quasiparticle poisoning in the design of quantum devices.
2291	This research paper investigates the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids and their relativistic effects including pressure, multi-component, curvature, and rotation. The study uses a set of equations to model the behavior of these fluids and analyzes the impact of various factors on their evolution. The results show that these second-order perturbations can have significant effects on the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the early stages of its formation. The study also highlights the importance of considering relativistic effects when modeling cosmological fluids. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the complex behavior of cosmological fluids and their role in shaping the universe.
2819	Context. A derivation of a generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law for nonthermal collisional rates of excitation by charged perturbers is presented. Aims. Aim of this paper is to find a more general analytical expression for a surface value of the source function which can be used as an addtional tool for verification of the non-LTE radiative transfer codes. Methods. Under the impact approximation hypothesis, static, one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere, constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength and direction, two-level atom model with unpolarized lower level and stimulated emission neglected, we introduce the unphysical terms into the equations of statistical equilibrium and solve the appropriate non-LTE integral equations. Results. We derive a new analytical condition for the surface values of the source function components expressed in the basis of irreducible spherical tensors.
3366	This paper presents a study on the spin-exchange collisions of submerged shell atoms below 1 Kelvin. We investigate the interaction between two atoms in a cold gas, focusing on the exchange of their magnetic moments. The experimental setup employs a magnetic trap to confine a cloud of ultracold atoms and a radio-frequency technique to measure the spin-exchange rates. Our results show that the spin-exchange cross-section decreases as the temperature decreases, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. We also observed that the collisional relaxation time increases as the density of the gas decreases. Our findings have important implications for the development of quantum computing and atomic clocks.
992	Quantized spin excitations in a single ferromagnetic microstrip have been measured using the microwave photovoltage technique. Several kinds of spin wave modes due to different contributions of the dipole-dipole and the exchange interactions are observed. Among them are a series of distinct dipole-exchange spin wave modes, which allow us to determine precisely the subtle spin boundary condition. A comprehensive picture for quantized spin excitations in a ferromagnet with finite size is thereby established. The dispersions of the quantized spin wave modes have two different branches separated by the saturation magnetization.
1377	We propose quantum dynamics for the dipole moving in cosmic string background and show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is still restored even in the presence of dipole moment of the particle. However, we show that the classical scale symmetry is broken due to inequivalent quantization of the the non-relativistic system. The consequence of this quantum anomaly is the formation of bound state in the interval \xi\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \Sigma. We show that within the interval \xi\in(-1,1), cosmic string with zero radius can bind the dipole and the dipole does not fall into the singularity.
207	In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.
3706	This research paper explores the philosophical question of why there is something rather than nothing. Through an examination of metaphysical theories and scientific evidence, the paper argues that the existence of something can be explained through the principles of causation and contingency. The paper also considers the implications of this question for our understanding of reality and the universe. Ultimately, the research concludes that the question of why there is something rather than nothing may never be fully answered, but that ongoing inquiry and exploration are essential to our understanding of the world around us.
1074	This research paper investigates the transient X-ray emission from normal galactic nuclei using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The study finds evidence of X-ray flares from several galaxies, indicating the presence of accretion onto supermassive black holes. The data also suggests that the flares are caused by changes in the accretion flow rather than variations in the intrinsic emission from the black hole. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the physics of accretion and black hole feeding in galactic nuclei.
D2-56	Metabolic engineering is a specialized field that focuses on optimizing metabolic pathways in organisms to enhance the production of desired products, such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. Applications include the development of microbes or cells capable of efficiently producing high-value compounds, improving the yield and sustainability of chemical manufacturing, and enhancing the production of bio-based materials. It also plays a key role in environmental biotechnology, such as detoxifying pollutants or remediating soil and water. Additionally, metabolic engineering is used to improve agricultural crops by enhancing their nutrient content, stress tolerance, or resistance to pests. By tailoring metabolic pathways, it enables the creation of novel therapeutic agents, advanced biofuels, and sustainable industrial processes.
2009	An interval coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring of E(G) by positive integers such that the colors on the edges incident to any vertex are consecutive. A (3,4)-biregular bigraph is a bipartite graph in which each vertex of one part has degree 3 and each vertex of the other has degree 4; it is unknown whether these all have interval colorings. We prove that G has an interval coloring using 6 colors when G is a (3,4)-biregular bigraph having a spanning subgraph whose components are paths with endpoints at 3-valent vertices and lengths in {2,4,6,8}. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a subgraph.
2848	This research paper investigates the oriented growth of pentacene films on vacuum-deposited polytetrafluoroethylene layers that are aligned using the rubbing technique. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the alignment on the morphology and electrical properties of the pentacene films. The results indicate that the rubbing technique produces highly aligned polytetrafluoroethylene layers, which leads to the formation of highly oriented pentacene films. The electrical conductivity of the pentacene films is found to be strongly dependent on the orientation of the film and the direction of the current flow. The study concludes that the rubbing technique can be used to control the orientation and electrical properties of pentacene films, which is important for the development of organic electronic devices.
2801	Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple (constant source function) and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet chromosphere, such as mottles/spicules, as well as for active region structures such as fibrils, arch filament systems (AFS), filaments and flares.
D2-65	Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term.
3170	We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting, the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling, and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization, where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on the size of nanoparticle.
2042	Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course, we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices (ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.
4035	We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions. Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the driving fields.
2681	This research paper explores the phenomenon of photo-assisted shot noise in Coulomb interacting systems. By using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study demonstrates that the interplay between Coulomb interactions and photo-assisted transport can lead to a non-trivial dependence of shot noise on the photo-excitation power. This effect is found to be robust against variations in system parameters and can be used as a tool to probe the underlying physics of the system. The results provide important insights into the behavior of correlated systems under external perturbations and have potential implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
2468	This research paper explores the concept of lattice refining loop quantum cosmology in the context of anisotropic models and stability. Loop quantum cosmology is a theoretical framework that seeks to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity to better understand the behavior of the universe on a cosmological scale. The lattice refining technique is used to increase the resolution of the lattice used in numerical simulations of loop quantum cosmology, allowing for more accurate and precise calculations. Anisotropic models are introduced to better account for the non-uniformity of the universe. The stability of these models is analyzed, and it is found that lattice refining can improve the stability of the system. The results of this study have potential implications for the understanding of the early universe and the development of more accurate cosmological models.
2180	"The research paper titled ""Intrinsic ripples in graphene"" explores the intrinsic ripples that occur naturally in graphene sheets due to thermal fluctuations. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of graphene at different temperatures, and the results show that the ripples in graphene sheets are intrinsic and can significantly affect the material's mechanical properties. The study also finds that the ripples can lead to the opening of band gaps and the emergence of new electronic states, which can have important implications for graphene-based electronic devices. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic ripples in graphene when designing and fabricating graphene-based materials and devices."
2476	This research paper explores the concept of the plasma puddle as a perturbative black hole, which has been observed in laboratory experiments. The primary focus of the study is to understand the physics behind this phenomenon and the potential implications for our understanding of black holes. The paper presents important discoveries, including the fact that the plasma puddle exhibits similar properties to black holes in terms of its gravitational pull and event horizon. The conclusion of the study highlights the potential for the plasma puddle to serve as a useful tool for studying black holes and advancing our knowledge of the universe.
2980	We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss further checks that need to be performed.
3097	"The research paper ""On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants"" examines the possible causes of asymmetries observed in supernova remnants. Using computer simulations, the authors investigate the effects of the initial conditions of the supernova explosion, the shape of the progenitor star, and the surrounding environment on the resulting remnant. They find that a combination of these factors can lead to the observed asymmetries. Additionally, the authors suggest that observations of supernova remnants can provide valuable insights into the properties of the progenitor star and the surrounding environment."
2172	We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects.
2710	We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural scaling model.
843	Linear measures such as cross-correlation have been used successfully to determine time delays from the given processes. Such an analysis often precedes identifying possible causal relationships between the observed processes. The present study investigates the impact of a positively correlated driver whose correlation function decreases monotonically with lag on the delay estimation in a two-node acyclic network with one and two-delays. It is shown that cross-correlation analysis of the given processes can result in spurious identification of multiple delays between the driver and the dependent processes. Subsequently, delay estimation of increment process as opposed to the original process under certain implicit constraints is explored. Short-range and long-range correlated driver processes along with those of their coarse-grained counterparts are considered.
D2-80	A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a sophisticated medical imaging technique that reveals how tissues and organs function at the molecular level. Unlike CT or MRI scans that show anatomical structure, PET scans detect metabolic activity by using a radioactive tracer—typically a form of glucose—injected into the bloodstream. This tracer emits positrons that create signals detected by the scanner. Areas with higher metabolic activity, such as rapidly growing cancer cells, absorb more tracer and appear brighter on the resulting 3D images. PET scans are particularly valuable for diagnosing and monitoring cancer, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular conditions. The procedure is painless, typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours, and exposes patients to minimal radiation.
3390	There is accumulating evidence in lattice QCD that attempts to locate confining fields in vacuum configurations bring results explicitly depending on tha lattice spacing (that is, ultraviolet cut off). Generically, one deals with low-dimensional vacuum defects which occupy a vanishing fraction of the total four-dimensional space. We review briefly existing data on the vacuum defects and their significance for confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena. We introduce the notion of `quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy, rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were triggered by creation of the Sakata model.
3003	We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well trap.
3952	A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
3886	This research paper focuses on the achievement of the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser. The primary objective of the study is to explore the fundamental limits of precision metrology using atom interferometry. The authors used a Bose-Einstein condensate of Rubidium atoms to generate a coherent matter wave and performed a series of interferometric measurements to determine the phase shift caused by a weak external force. The results show that the Heisenberg limit can be reached by optimizing the interferometric sequence and reducing the shot noise. The study also highlights the importance of using squeezed states to achieve the ultimate sensitivity. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the development of atomic sensors with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity.
501	Dense granular matter has to expand in order to flow, a phenomenon known as dilatancy. Here we perform, by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, direct measurements of the evolution of the local packing density of a slow and smooth granular shear flow generated in a split-bottomed geometry. The dilatancy is found to be surprisingly strong. The dilated zone follow the region of large strain rate and slowly spreads as a function of time. This suggests that the local packing density is governed by the total amount of local strain experienced since the start of the experiment.
2941	This research paper investigates the geometry effects at atomic-sized contacts of aluminium. Through extensive simulations and experiments, it is found that the conductance of the contacts is dependent on the geometrical factors such as the contact area and shape. The study also reveals that the conductance of the contacts decreases with increasing contact area, and that the shape of the contact has a significant impact on the conductance. These findings provide insights into the behaviour of atomic-sized contacts and have implications for the development of nanoscale devices.
2057	When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible with the Holographic Principle.
2575	We report CCD photometry and spectroscopy during 2006 outburst of the dwarf nova SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 (SDSS J1021). The photographic plates from the MAO, SAI and CrAO plate archives, which cover the position of the SDSS J1021, were inspected for the presence of previous outbursts. We also present the BVRcIc photometric calibration of 52 stars in SDSS J1021 vicinity, which have V-magnitude in the range of 11.21-17.23m and can serve as comparison stars. The large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this object as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova.
2028	This research paper investigates the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solitons trapped in a double-channel potential. The study uses numerical simulations to examine the behavior of solitons in different channel configurations. The paper shows that the solitons can spontaneously break symmetry, leading to the emergence of a new stable state. This phenomenon occurs due to the asymmetric potential created by the double-channel. The results provide insights into the dynamics of solitons in complex potentials and could have implications in various fields, including optics and condensed matter physics.
3990	The entanglement entropy of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising model is studied with a numerical implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the entropy per surface area diverges at, and only at, the quantum phase transition that is governed by an infinite randomness fixed point. Here we identify a double-logarithmic multiplicative correction to the area law for the entanglement entropy. This contrasts with the pure area law valid at the infinite randomness fixed point in the diluted transverse Ising model in higher dimensions.
1991	Improved actions in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theories are investigated with an emphasis on asymptotic scaling. A new scheme for tadpole improvement is proposed. The standard but heuristic tadpole improvement emerges from a mean field approximation from the new approach. Scaling is investigated by means of the large distance static quark potential. Both, the generic and the new tadpole scheme yield significant improvements on asymptotic scaling when compared with loop improved actions. A study of the rotational symmetry breaking terms, however, reveals that only the new improvement scheme efficiently eliminates the leading irrelevant term from the action.
1528	Impedance measurements provide a useful probe of the physics of bolometers and calorimeters. We describe a method for measuring the complex impedance of these devices. In previous work, stray impedances and readout electronics of the measurement apparatus have resulted in artifacts in the impedance data. The new technique allows experimenters to find an independent Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit for each frequency. This method allows experimenters to easily isolate the device impedance from the effects of parasitic impedances and frequency dependent gains in amplifiers.

Ultimately, this work demonstrates the value of studying the distribution of the BF in advancing our understanding of fragmentation and related phenomena.

913	The paper proposes a reconstruction algorithm for models on random graphs, which is able to recover the model parameters with high accuracy. The algorithm is based on a local-to-global approach, where local observations are used to estimate the global parameters. The authors also prove that the algorithm is optimal in terms of sample complexity and provides a tight bound on the number of samples required for accurate reconstruction. The proposed algorithm is then applied to various models on random graphs, including the stochastic block model, the exponential random graph model, and the degree-corrected block model. The results show that the algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and sample complexity. Overall, the paper provides a practical and efficient method for reconstructing models on random graphs, which has important applications in network analysis and social sciences.
3392	The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be defined for each such manifestation.
3889	We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.
2350	This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By using noncooperative game-theoretic models and large system analysis, explicit expressions are derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects of self- and multiple-access interference at a receiving access point. Performance of the PRake is compared in terms of achieved utilities and loss to that of the all-Rake receiver.
D2-47	Systems Biology is not one thing, and is quite different to different people. In my view Systems Biology is really a modern perspective on doing basic Biology research. It is not really an applied field, intending to directly be useful for industry and make products. Instead it aims to unlock the key principles of life, which can be used to do that thereafter. However, a lot of the processes of Systems Biology involves using cutting edge tools, especially computational ones, which can give you a good handle on the process of being a “data scientist”, handling large amount of experimentally obtained data, processing and analyzing it to make decisions about future course of actions.
1772	We use optical tweezers to perform stretching experiments on DNA molecules when interacting with the drugs daunomycin and ethidium bromide, which intercalate the DNA molecule. These experiments are performed in the low-force regime from zero up to 2 pN. Our results show that the persistence length of the DNA-drug complexes increases strongly as the drug concentration increases up to some critical value. Above this critical value, the persistence length decreases abruptly and remains practically constant for larger drug concentrations. The contour length of the molecules increases monotonically and saturates as drugs concentration increases. Measured in- tercalants critical concentrations for the persistence length transition coincide with reported values for the helix-coil transition of DNA-drug complexes, obtained from sedimentation experiments.
3169	This research paper aims to investigate the problem of enumerating limit groups, which are important objects in geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology. The paper begins with an overview of limit groups, their properties, and their significance in various areas of mathematics. Then, we present a survey of existing algorithms and techniques for enumerating limit groups, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also propose a new algorithm that employs a combination of geometric and algebraic methods to compute the number of limit groups up to a given isomorphism class. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several examples and comparisons with existing methods. Finally, we discuss open problems and directions for future research in this area. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of research on limit groups and provides new insights into their enumeration.
892	Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a (modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the implications for faster-than light travel.

2601	Recent X-ray surveys have provided a large number of high-luminosity, obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the so-called Type 2 quasars. Despite the large amount of multi-wavelength supporting data, the main parameters related to the black holes harbored in such AGN are still poorly known. Here we present the results obtained for a sample of eight Type 2 quasars in the redshift range 0.9-2.1 selected from the HELLAS2XMM survey, for which we used Ks-band, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS data at 24 micron to estimate bolometric corrections, black hole masses, and Eddington ratios.

The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their relationship with galaxy formation.
3213	The 6.4 day classical Cepheid AW Per is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 40 years. Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November 2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although we currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the success of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination, sini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs. Since the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the combination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit would give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby providing a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.

The article concludes that CMDNC is a promising protocol for improving the efficiency and reliability of cooperative transmission systems.
1851	A reduction of polarization in ultra-thin ferroelectric films appears to be fundamental to ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. For the model system PbTiO3 on SrTiO3, we report observation of the polarization vs. thickness relation. Distinct periodicity changes of ferroelectric domains obtained from x-ray diffraction and total energy calculations reveal a linear lowering of the polarization below a critical thickness of ~12 nm. Independent polarization and tetragonality measurements provide insight into the fundamental relation between polarization and tetragonality in nanoscale ferroelectrics.
3019	We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and ``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active ferroelectric ions.
2611	We show that full-image micro-PIV analysis in combination with images of transient particle motion is a powerful tool for experimental studies of acoustic radiation forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic chambers under piezo-actuation in the MHz range. The measured steady-state motion of both large 5 um and small 1 um particles can be understood in terms of the acoustic eigenmodes or standing ultra-sound waves in the given experimental microsystems. This interpretation is supported by numerical solutions of the corresponding acoustic wave equation.

465	We show that finite size superconductors have a spectrum of states at extremely low energy, i.e. inside the superconducting gap. The presence of this {\it thin spectrum} is a generic feature and related to the fact that in a superconductor the global phase rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. For a strong coupling superconductor we find the spectrum by exactly solving the Lieb-Mattis type Hamiltonian onto which the problem maps. One of the physical consequences of the presence of thin states is that they cause quantum decoherence in superconducting qubits of finite extent.

54	This research paper analyses the error probability of peaky signaling over fading channels. The study considers the effects of fading on the peaky signaling, and derives the closed-form expressions for the error probability of the peaky signaling over Rayleigh and generalized fading channels. The results show that the error probability of the peaky signaling is significantly affected by the channel fading. It is also found that the performance of the peaky signaling is improved by increasing the peakiness factor. The findings of this study provide insights for the design of reliable communication systems over fading channels using peaky signaling.
872	Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can send signals over more than 100 km standard optical fiber and are widely believed to be secure. Here, we show experimentally for the first time a technologically feasible attack, namely the time-shift attack, against a commercial QKD system. Our result shows that, contrary to popular belief, an eavesdropper, Eve, has a non-negligible probability (~4%) to break the security of the system. Eve's success is due to the well-known detection efficiency loophole in the experimental testing of Bell inequalities. Therefore, the detection efficiency loophole plays a key role not only in fundamental physics, but also in technological applications such as QKD.
3918	A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.

D1-27	"We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models ""sunspot activity – temperature""."
2431	This research paper investigates the formation of a sonic horizon in isotropically expanding Bose-Einstein condensates. We use numerical simulations to study the behavior of a condensate as it undergoes rapid expansion and observe the formation of a sonic horizon, a boundary beyond which sound waves cannot propagate. Our results indicate that the formation of a sonic horizon is dependent on the initial velocity and the strength of the interactions between the particles in the condensate. We also observe the emergence of shock waves and the formation of vortices in the condensate. Our findings have implications for the study of superfluids and the behavior of quantum fluids in extreme conditions. Overall, this research highlights the complex and fascinating behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates and the importance of further exploration in this field.
2755	We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.
3120	This research paper investigates the interactions, superconducting $T_c$, and fluctuation magnetization for two coupled quantum dots in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. The study shows that the coupling strength and the dot size have a significant impact on the superconducting $T_c$ and fluctuation magnetization. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of considering the interplay between quantum interference and Coulomb interactions in determining the properties of the system. Overall, the findings provide insights into the behavior of coupled quantum dots in the presence of superconductivity and magnetic fields.

The study reports the observation of half-vortices in a polariton condensate and investigates their stability and dynamics. The results suggest that half-vortices can be created and manipulated, and may have potential applications in polariton-based devices. The paper concludes that half-vortices represent a new class of topological excitations in polariton condensates and provide a unique platform for the study of quantum fluids."
1538	We explore the main physical processes which potentially affect the topological signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for a range of toroidal universes. We consider specifically reionisation, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the size of the causal horizon, topological defects and primordial gravitational waves. We use three estimators: the information content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma ranges allowed by present data. We find that only Omega_Lambda, which influences both ISW and the size of the causal horizon, significantly alters the detection for all three estimators considered here.
1340	This research paper aims to investigate the systematics of the threshold incident energy for deep sub-barrier fusion hindrance. The study involves the analysis of experimental data obtained from various fusion reactions. The aim is to identify the factors that contribute to the hindrance effect in deep sub-barrier fusion and to determine the threshold energy required for fusion to occur. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data and discusses the implications of the findings for our understanding of nuclear fusion processes. The results of this study have significant implications for the development of new fusion technologies and for our understanding of the behavior of nuclear systems at low energies.
D2-13	Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.
3655	We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
3306	This research paper presents a spectral method for matching exterior and interior elliptic problems. The proposed method uses a combination of boundary integral equations and spectral approximations to solve the exterior and interior problems simultaneously. The method is shown to be accurate and efficient for solving problems with smooth boundaries and homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. The paper also includes numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in solving various elliptic problems. The results show that the spectral method is highly accurate and can achieve high convergence rates. The paper concludes that the proposed method is a promising approach for solving elliptic problems in both the interior and exterior domains.
1843	Considering a separable and purely kinetic 5D scalar field on a warped product metric background we propose a new and more general approach for inducing 4D scalar potentials on a 4D constant foliation of the 5D space-time. We obtain an induced potential for a true 4D scalar field instead of a potential for an effective 4D scalar field. In this formalism we can recover the usual 4D inflationary formalism with a geometrically induced inflationary potential. In addition the quantum confinement of the inflaton modes is obtained naturally from the model for at least a class of warping factors. Besides the 4D inflationary physics that results of this formalism is independent of the 4D-hypersurface chosen.
D2-23	Diabetes type 1 and type 2 are both chronic conditions affecting blood sugar regulation but have different causes and mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance, where the body still produces insulin but cannot use it effectively. It is more common in adults and is strongly linked to obesity, diet, and lifestyle factors. Type 2 can often be managed with diet, exercise, and medication, while type 1 requires insulin replacement. Both types require careful blood sugar management to prevent complications.
2811	We show that Green function methods can be straightforwardly applied to nonlinear equations appearing as the leading order of a short time expansion. Higher order corrections can be then computed giving a satisfactory agreement with numerical results. The relevance of these results relies on the possibility of fully exploiting a gradient expansion in both classical and quantum field theory granting the existence of a strong coupling expansion. Having a Green function in this regime in quantum field theory amounts to obtain the corresponding spectrum of the theory.
2907	We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons which does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement of light emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomic ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in cells at room temperature.
3490	The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper. Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii) the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism, characterized by the number of cams and their width.
3602	In this paper the benefits provided by multi-cell processing of signals transmitted by mobile terminals which are received via dedicated relay terminals (RTs) are assessed. Unlike previous works, each RT is assumed here to be capable of full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent relay terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a simplified uplink cellular model introduced by Wyner is considered. This framework facilitates analytical derivation of the per-cell sum-rate of multi-cell and conventional single-cell receivers. In particular, the analysis is based on the observation that the signal received at the base stations can be interpreted as the outcome of a two-dimensional linear time invariant system. Numerical results are provided as well in order to provide further insight into the performance benefits of multi-cell processing with relaying.
3336	The Positive Mass Theorem is a fundamental result in general relativity that relates the mass of an asymptotically flat spacetime to its geometry. In this research paper, we focus on the near-equality case of the theorem, where the mass is almost zero but not quite. We establish new criteria for the near-equality case and show that they are satisfied in certain important examples, such as the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our findings suggest that the near-equality case is not a pathological regime of the theorem and should be taken seriously as a physical situation. We conclude that the Positive Mass Theorem remains a powerful tool for understanding the geometry and physics of spacetimes in general relativity.
689	We present here a detailed study of the behaviour of a three dimensional Brownian motor based on cold atoms in a double optical lattice [P. Sjolund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 190602 (2006)]. This includes both experiments and numerical simulations of a Brownian particle. The potentials used are spatially and temporally symmetric, but combined spatiotemporal symmetry is broken by phase shifts and asymmetric transfer rates between potentials. The diffusion of atoms in the optical lattices is rectified and controlled both in direction and speed along three dimensions. We explore a large range of experimental parameters, where irradiances and detunings of the optical lattice lights are varied within the dissipative regime. Induced drift velocities in the order of one atomic recoil velocity have been achieved.
1469	As an AI language model, I do not have access to a specific research paper as context. However, based on the title, the Deformation Principle and further geometrization of physics suggest that the paper might explore the idea of using the principles of deformation and geometry to enhance the understanding of physics. This might involve using mathematical models to describe physical phenomena and understanding the underlying geometric structures that govern them. The paper might also discuss the potential applications of these ideas in various fields of physics, including particle physics and cosmology. The key results or conclusions of the research paper might include new insights into the nature of physical phenomena and the development of more accurate and comprehensive models for understanding them.
D1-29	The COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, but that doesn’t mean the novel coronavirus had originated from China. It may have originated from somewhere else. To determine the origin of an unknown virus requires scientific, meticulous research, instead of random speculation. The source of the virus is a scientific issue and requires a professional investigation. Without evidence supported by data or research, no one can claim where it had originated from. Connecting a virus with a region may cause xenophobic behavior. The pandemic influenza of 2009 originated in North America, but it was not called the “North America flu.” That is why the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus “COVID-19,” which avoids stigmatizing a particularly region.
448	This research paper presents a detailed investigation of the X-ray source IGR J16194-2810, which was detected by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). The aim of this study is to determine whether IGR J16194-2810 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary, a type of binary star system in which a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, accretes material from a companion star. We analyze the X-ray and optical properties of IGR J16194-2810 using data from various telescopes, including XMM-Newton and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Our results suggest that IGR J16194-2810 is indeed a symbiotic X-ray binary, with a red giant star as its companion. The implications of this discovery for our understanding of the formation and evolution of binary star systems are discussed.

The results of empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying network communities with high precision and accuracy, thereby opening up new avenues for research in this field.
1665	We describe a method for obtaining analytic solutions corresponding to exact marginal deformations in open bosonic string field theory. For the photon marginal deformation we have an explicit analytic solution to all orders. Our construction is based on a pure gauge solution where the gauge field is not in the Hilbert space. We show that the solution itself is nevertheless perfectly regular. We study its gauge transformations and calculate some coefficients explicitly. Finally, we discuss how our method can be implemented for other marginal deformations.
1731	The effective gluon propagator constructed with the pinch technique is governed by a Schwinger-Dyson equation with special structure and gauge properties, that can be deduced from the correspondence with the background field method. Most importantly the non-perturbative gluon self-energy is transverse order-by-order in the dressed loop expansion, and separately for gluonic and ghost contributions, a property which allows for a meanigfull truncation. A linearized version of the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equation is derived, using a vertex that satisfies the required Ward identity and contains massless poles. The resulting integral equation, subject to a properly regularized constraint, is solved numerically, and the main features of the solutions are briefly discussed.
3134	"The research paper titled ""GLAST and Dark Matter Substructure in the Milky Way"" explores the potential of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) to detect dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. The study utilizes simulations to investigate the expected gamma-ray signals from dark matter subhalos and streams. The results suggest that GLAST could detect a significant number of dark matter subhalos and streams, aiding in the search for the elusive particle responsible for dark matter. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the substructure of dark matter in the Milky Way for future studies of galactic structure and evolution."
1847	Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking. Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the correlation with more predictive procedures.
1735	This research paper examines low energy proton-proton scattering within the framework of effective field theory. The study utilizes the power counting scheme to systematically organize the relevant interactions and perturbative expansions. The resulting effective theory is able to accurately describe low energy scattering data and provides insight into the underlying dynamics of the proton-proton interaction. The effects of higher order contributions are also analyzed, revealing the importance of including them in the calculation. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of effective field theory as a tool for understanding low energy proton-proton scattering.

600	In this paper we review the applicability of autofluorescent proteins for single-molecule imaging in biology. The photophysical characteristics of several mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and those of DsRed are compared and critically discussed for their use in cellular biology. The alternative use of two-photon excitation at the single-molecule level or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is envisaged for the study of individual autofluorescent proteins.

Finally, the first use at the single-molecule level of citrine, a more photostable variant of the eYFP is reported when fused to a receptor for neurotransmitter in live cells.

The paper reviews the historical development of the concept of work function and discusses various theories that have been proposed to explain its origin. The authors argue that the work function is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors such as the electronic structure of the material, its surface characteristics, and the presence of impurities. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the origin of the work function in designing and optimizing electronic devices.
2940	We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts. Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy, leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer.

The results of the paper contribute to a better understanding of the STIT theory and its potential applications in fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics.
880	This research paper investigates the effect of beta-Dystroglycan (beta-DG) processing on Utrophin/DP116 anchorage in normal and MDX mouse Schwann cell membrane. The study found that beta-DG processing significantly affects the localization of Utrophin/DP116 in the Schwann cell membrane, leading to reduced membrane stabilization and increased susceptibility to damage. This suggests that beta-DG processing may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and highlights the potential of Utrophin/DP116 as a therapeutic target for this condition. Overall, these results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and have important implications for the development of novel therapies.
3557	This research paper explores the concept of spacetime coordinates in special relativity theory. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the fundamental principles of spacetime and the implications of time dilation and length contraction.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that the understanding of spacetime coordinates is essential in comprehending the laws of physics and developing new technologies such as GPS systems.
D2-53	"Lavoisier's Law, formally known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, is one of the fundamental principles in chemistry established by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century . The law states that In a closed system, matter is neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions or physical transformations . In simpler terms, the total mass of substances present before a chemical reaction equals the total mass after the reaction, even though the substances may change form. Lavoisier demonstrated this principle through meticulous experiments where he carefully measured the mass of reactants and products. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794), often called the ""father of modern chemistry,"" formulated this principle around 1774."
721	We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson loops.
1544	We prove that the open topological string partition function on a D-brane configuration in a Calabi-Yau manifold X takes the form of a closed topological string partition function on a different Calabi-Yau manifold X_b. This identification shows that the physics of D-branes in an arbitrary background X of topological string theory can be described either by open+closed string theory in X or by closed string theory in X_b. The physical interpretation of the ''bubbling'' Calabi-Yau X_b is as the space obtained by letting the D-branes in X undergo a geometric transition. This implies, in particular, that the partition function of closed topological string theory on certain bubbling Calabi-Yau manifolds are invariants of knots in the three-sphere.
2923	Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in the Heisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and Kerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied via Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact of decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for beating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902 (2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an appreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an increase in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence effect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing information is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the enhancement is able to survive.

The main result of the paper is the development of a POVM-based formalism for polarization optics, which is shown to be mathematically rigorous and physically meaningful. The conclusion is that the POVM approach represents a valuable new tool for researchers in the field of polarization optics, with potential applications in areas such as optical communication, imaging, and sensing.
1649	To synthesize a new superconductor which has a critical temperature, Tc, exceeding the room temperature, one needs to know what chemical components to start with. This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one to draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential room-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room temperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and atoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion is fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any assumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This, however, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is an easy task.
1134	The research paper investigates advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in astrophysics, where the gas flow is dominated by advection instead of viscosity. The authors propose a model with causal viscosity, which considers the effects of thermal conduction and radiation on the gas flow. The study finds that the causal viscosity model can explain the observed properties of ADAFs, such as their low luminosity and weak X-ray emission. The findings suggest that the causal viscosity model can improve our understanding of the accretion processes around black holes and neutron stars.

The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of these materials under different conditions and demonstrates that the presence of a Zeeman field can significantly affect the superconductor-ferromagnet transition. The paper concludes that the Zeeman field plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of these materials, and further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering magnetic fields when studying the properties of metallic grains."
3186	Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of patterns is the delta function.
3876	We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.
2804	This research paper investigates the generation of entanglement of photon-number states using coherent light through the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. The cross-Kerr interaction has been proposed as a promising method for generating entanglement between photons in different modes. We present a theoretical analysis of the cross-Kerr interaction and propose a scheme for generating entangled photon-number states. Our results show that entanglement between photon-number states can be generated with high fidelity using this method. This research provides a novel approach for generating entangled states and has potential applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.
3166	We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of gravitational energy.
3712	This research paper proposes a general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws, with a focus on nonparametric regression. The primary theme is to develop a flexible and robust method to estimate the relationship between physical variables without making assumptions about the functional form of the underlying relationship. The significant findings indicate that the proposed approach can handle complex data and provide accurate predictions. The study concludes that nonparametric regression can be a valuable tool for model selection and prediction in physical sciences.
1483	The paper explores the critical ionization velocity (CIV) effect, a phenomenon in which a neutral gas is ionized by a supersonic flow. The authors suggest that this effect may be responsible for the observed continuum emissions in interstellar space. They analyze data from the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts, as well as ground-based observations, and find evidence of CIV-related emissions. The authors conclude that further research is needed to fully understand the CIV effect and its role in interstellar physics.
3606	Although there is mounting observational evidence that the cosmic expansion is undergoing a late-time acceleration, the physical mechanism behind such a phenomenon is yet unknown. In this paper, we investigate a holographic dark energy (HDE) model with interaction between the components of the dark sector in the light of current cosmological observations. We use both the new \emph{gold} sample of 182 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the 192 SNe Ia ESSENCE data, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the shift parameter from the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. In agreement with previous results, we show that these observations suggest a very weak coupling or even a noninteracting HDE. The phantom crossing behavior in the context of these scenarios is also briefly discussed.
835	This research paper investigates the structure of sunspot penumbrae, with a specific focus on the origin of dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains. The study utilizes the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium model to analyze penumbral flux tubes. The results suggest that the dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains originate from the convective overshoot region and the MHS equilibrium in penumbral flux tubes. The findings shed light on the fundamental physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of sunspot penumbrae. This research has significant implications for our understanding of the dynamics of sunspots and their impact on space weather.
3541	This research paper explores the relationship between satisfiability and the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem, demonstrating that the former can be parsimoniously reduced to the latter. Through this reduction, the authors provide new insights into the complexity of both problems and suggest that the Tantrix(TM) puzzle may be an effective tool for studying NP-complete problems. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential for further research in this area and the implications for the broader field of computer science.
1306	This research paper explores the relationship between bialgebra cohomology, pointed Hopf algebras, and deformations. Specifically, we investigate how the cohomology of bialgebras can be used to understand the structure of pointed Hopf algebras, and how deformations of these algebras can be studied through their cohomology. Our main result is the characterization of the infinitesimal deformations of pointed Hopf algebras in terms of their bialgebra cohomology. We also provide examples of how this result can be applied in the study of algebraic structures. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between cohomology and deformation theory, and highlights the importance of bialgebra cohomology in the study of Hopf algebras.
896	Kernel-based nonparametric hazard rate estimation is considered with a special class of infinite-order kernels that achieves favorable bias and mean square error properties. A fully automatic and adaptive implementation of a density and hazard rate estimator is proposed for randomly right censored data. Careful selection of the bandwidth in the proposed estimators yields estimates that are more efficient in terms of overall mean squared error performance, and in some cases achieves a nearly parametric convergence rate. Additionally, rapidly converging bandwidth estimates are presented for use in second-order kernels to supplement such kernel-based methods in hazard rate estimation. Simulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator against other nonparametric estimators of the density and hazard function. A real data application is also presented on survival data from 13,166 breast carcinoma patients.
2080	This paper derives an explicit formula for Branson's Q-curvature in even-dimensional conformal geometry. The ingredients in the formula come from the Poincare metric in one higher dimension; hence the formula is called holographic. When specialized to the conformally flat case, the holographic formula expresses Q-curvature as a multiple of the Pfaffian and the divergence of a natural one-form. The paper also outlines the relation between holographic formulae for Q-curvature and a new theory of conformally covariant families of differential operators due to the second author.
3967	This paper investigates the evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole and explores the effect of the black hole quadrupole on this evolution. The Carter constant plays a crucial role in determining the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes and is particularly important for understanding the dynamics of objects approaching black holes. We use numerical simulations to study the evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole with and without a quadrupole moment. Our results show that the quadrupole moment has a significant impact on the evolution of the Carter constant, causing it to vary more rapidly and exhibit greater complexity. These findings have important implications for understanding the gravitational waves emitted by inspirals into black holes and for testing the predictions of general relativity in strong gravitational fields.
2584	This research paper investigates a finite volume-finite element scheme for a nuclear transport model. The focus of the study is to examine the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme in solving the complex transport equations that govern nuclear radiation in various media. The numerical simulations are carried out using a benchmark problem to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The results show that the scheme is able to accurately predict the radiation flux and energy deposition in the media. Additionally, the scheme is found to be efficient in terms of computational time and memory usage. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the finite volume-finite element scheme in modeling nuclear transport phenomena.
549	Both bright and dark traveling, locked, intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) have been generated with a spatially uniform driver at a frequency in the acoustic spectrum of a nonlinear micromechanical cantilever array. Complementary numerical simulations show that a minimum density of modes, hence array size, is required for the formation of such locked smoothly running excitations. Additional simulations on a small 1-D antiferromagnetic spin system are used to illustrate that such uniformly driven running ILMs should be a generic feature of a nanoscale atomic lattice.
D2-10	"The origin of angiosperms (flowering plants) represents what Charles Darwin famously called an ""abominable mystery"" due to their apparent sudden appearance and rapid diversification in the fossil record. Modern research combines multiple lines of evidence to address this evolutionary puzzle. The fossil record shows unequivocal angiosperm evidence beginning in the Early Cretaceous (approximately 125-130 million years ago), with remarkably diverse forms appearing within 20-30 million years. Key early fossils include Archaefructus and Montsechia, with water lily relatives among the earliest documented flowering plants. Molecular evidence, however, suggests an earlier origin than fossils indicate. DNA-based phylogenies identify Amborella, water lilies, and Austrobaileyales as the earliest-diverging lineages. Molecular clock analyses often place angiosperm origins in the Jurassic period (145-201 million years ago)."
3566	A simple but general microscopic mechanism to understand the interplay between the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom is developed. Within this mechanism, the magnetic structure generates an electric current which induce an counterbalance electric current from the spin orbital coupling. When the magnetic structure is described by a single order parameter, the electric polarization is determined by the single spin orbital coupling parameter, and the material is predicted to be a half insulator. This mechanism provides a simple estimation of the value of ferroelectricity and sets a physical limitation as well.
1739	The study proposes an experimental demonstration of the exact mapping of the 2+1 Dirac oscillator onto the Jaynes-Cummings model using ion-trap technology. By employing this mapping, the researchers aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of the Dirac oscillator and its connection to quantum optics. The proposed experiment is expected to yield valuable insights into the dynamics of these systems, potentially leading to new applications in quantum information processing. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of these findings and their relevance to the field of quantum mechanics.
3407	The two-dimensional ionic Hubbard model is a theoretical model used to study the behavior of electrons in materials with both ionic and metallic properties. In this study, the focus was on the metallic phase of the model, which describes the behavior of electrons in a material with metallic properties. The researchers used computer simulations to explore the behavior of electrons in the metallic phase of the model and found that the behavior was highly dependent on the strength of the ionic interactions. They also found that the metallic phase could exhibit a variety of different behaviors, including superconductivity and magnetic ordering. The study provides important insights into the behavior of electrons in materials with both metallic and ionic properties, which could have important implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic properties.
1148	This article reports the world averages for measurements on b-hadron properties obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) using the available results at the end of 2006. In the averaging, the input parameters used in the various analyses are adjusted (rescaled) to common values, and all known correlations are taken into account. The averages include lifetimes, neutral meson mixing parameters, parameters of semileptonic decays, branching fractions of B decays to final states with open charm, charmonium and no charm, and measurements related to CP asymmetries.
1875	The Wess-Zumino consistency condition is a crucial tool for understanding the behavior of Weyl anomalies in conformal field theories. In this research paper, we explore the general solutions of this condition, which provide insights into the underlying structure of conformal field theories. Our findings reveal that the solutions can be expressed in terms of topological invariants and that they are closely related to the Schwinger terms in the effective action. We also show that the solutions can be used to obtain constraints on the central charges of the theory. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental properties of conformal field theories and has important implications for the broader field of theoretical physics.
2245	This research paper presents a simulation study of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNRFETs) using a numerical device simulator. GNRFETs are a promising technology for building high-performance electronic devices due to their unique electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the performance of GNRFETs by analyzing the device characteristics such as the current-voltage (I-V) curves, the transconductance (gm), and the subthreshold swing (SS). We explore the impact of various parameters such as the channel length, the width, and the gate voltage on the device performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that the GNRFETs exhibit superior performance compared to conventional silicon-based field effect transistors. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of GNRFETs for future device applications.
3719	The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times.
1434	The paper explores the geometry of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, focusing on the properties of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with PT symmetry. Using geometric methods, the authors show that the eigenfunctions of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians have a natural interpretation as geodesics on a curved manifold. They also demonstrate that the PT symmetry of the Hamiltonian is intimately related to the curvature of this manifold. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the understanding of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, including the possibility of new applications in areas such as quantum computing and information theory.
30	The paper proposes a method for reconstructing weak values without the need for weak measurements. The authors show that the weak value can be obtained by measuring the post-selected state of a pre-selected ensemble of systems. The proposed method is experimentally tested and shown to be equivalent to the traditional weak measurement method. The authors conclude that the proposed method could be useful in situations where weak measurements are difficult to implement or when post-selection is the only available measurement technique.
934	This research paper presents an experimental study of coherent A1 phonons in Te using tailored femtosecond pulses. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the dynamics of A1 phonons and their coherence in Te. The researchers use time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy to measure the coherent oscillations of A1 phonons and observe their behavior under different excitation conditions. The study reveals that coherent A1 phonons can be generated and controlled by tailored femtosecond pulses. The results provide important insights into the coherent dynamics of A1 phonons in Te, which can have significant implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
281	The paper describes a tracking control algorithm for multi-agent systems with an active leader and variable topology. The goal is to achieve consensus among the agents by tracking the trajectory of the leader. The proposed algorithm uses a decentralized control law that takes into account the relative positions and velocities of neighboring agents. The authors prove that the algorithm guarantees asymptotic convergence to the leader trajectory under certain assumptions on the communication topology and control parameters. They also provide simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in achieving consensus. The paper highlights the importance of the leader role in multi-agent systems and presents a practical approach to achieving consensus in a decentralized manner.
D1-7	Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers.In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities.
1197	This research paper investigates the Casimir effect in a six-dimensional warped flux compactification model. The study employs a combination of numerical and analytical methods to calculate the Casimir energy and pressure of the model. The results show that the Casimir energy and pressure are highly dependent on the shape and size of the extra dimensions. The study concludes that the Casimir effect can be a useful tool for probing the geometry and topology of extra dimensions in higher-dimensional models.
999	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of harmonic generation from laser-irradiated clusters. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the mechanisms underlying the generation of high-order harmonics in clusters exposed to intense laser fields. The results show that the harmonics are generated through a combination of multiple mechanisms, including ionization, recombination, and ponderomotive acceleration. The study also shows that the harmonic spectra exhibit strong dependence on the cluster size and laser intensity. The research provides insights into the fundamental physics of high-order harmonic generation in clusters and has potential applications in attosecond science and ultrafast spectroscopy.
878	This research paper focuses on the use of impedance spectroscopy to study the electrical properties of epitaxial multiferroic thin films. The main theme of the paper is the investigation of the impact of epitaxial strain on the electrical conductivity and polarization of multiferroic thin films. The study concludes that epitaxial strain has a significant influence on the electrical conductivity of the films, and that this effect is dependent on the type of multiferroic material used. The results of this research provide valuable insights into the behavior of multiferroic thin films under different conditions and could aid in the development of new multiferroic materials for use in various applications.
1140	We theoretically discuss how to tune the competition between Forster transfer and spontaneous emission in a continuous and nondestructive fashion. The proposed approach is especially suitable for delicate biological systems like light harvesting complexes and fluorescent protein oligomers. We demonstrate that the manipulation of the density of photonic states at the emission frequency of the energy donor results in a change of the quantum efficiencies of the competing energy transfer and spontaneous emission processes. This change will be manifested in a modification of the donor and acceptor emission intensities. Thus, by controlling the local density of photonic states Forster coupled systems can be manipulated and analyzed without the need to physically separate donor and acceptor chromophores for individual analysis, which is of interest, for example, for oligomeric reef coral fluorescent proteins.
485	We conduct a review of experimental results on Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR's) including measurements of the features of the spectrum, the composition of the primary particle flux and the search for anisotropy in event arrival direction. We find that while there is a general consensus on the features in the spectrum -- the Second Knee, the Ankle, and (to a lesser extent) the GZK Cutoff -- there is little consensus on the composition of the primaries that accompany these features. This lack of consensus on the composition makes interpretation of the agreed upon features problematic. There is also little direct evidence about potential sources of UHECRs, as early reports of arrival direction anisotropies have not been confirmed in independent measurements.
80	"The paper ""Thermal noise informatics"" explores the potential of using thermal noise to achieve secure communication through a wire, zero-power communication, and thermal noise driven computing. The authors present a theoretical framework for understanding the properties of thermal noise and its potential applications in information processing. They demonstrate the feasibility of using thermal noise as a source of randomness for encryption and decryption of messages, as well as for powering low-energy devices. The authors also discuss the potential of thermal noise as a computational resource, offering promising results in simulations of simple logic gates. Overall, the paper suggests that thermal noise has significant potential for advancing the field of information processing and communication."
49	In this paper, pilot-assisted transmission over Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading channels is considered. A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is transmitted every T symbols and T-1 data symbols are transmitted in between the pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are optimized by maximizing this lower bound.
3735	Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole interaction.
461	The purpose of this comment is first to correct a misapprehension of the role played by composite wave diffraction on surface-wave generation at subwavelength structures and second to point out that periodic Bloch structures are unnecessary for the efficient production of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) guided mode either as traveling or standing waves. Guided surface waves originate from simple slit or groove edges illuminated under normal incidence, and one-dimensional (1-D) surface cavities from these standing waves are easily realized.
516	This research paper focuses on the study of skew critical problems. A skew critical problem is a problem where the skewness of the input affects the output significantly. The paper provides a formal definition of skew critical problems and discusses their importance and applications. The authors also present a theoretical framework for analyzing skew critical problems and propose an algorithm for solving them efficiently. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of skew critical problems in different fields and the need for further research in this area.
4021	A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are discussed.
1484	The pseudoparticle approach is a numerical technique to compute path integrals without discretizing spacetime. The basic idea is to integrate over those field configurations, which can be represented by a sum of a fixed number of localized building blocks (pseudoparticles). In a couple of previous papers we have successfully applied the pseudoparticle approach to pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. In this work we discuss how to incorporate fermionic fields in the pseudoparticle approach. To test our method, we compute the phase diagram of the 1+1-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large-N limit.
1745	The PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) study is a large-scale MRI experiment designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac MRI for the evaluation of patients with chest pain. However, the spiral MRI acquisition used in PROMISE is susceptible to boundary effects, which can compromise image quality and accuracy. In this research paper, we propose a novel method for reducing boundary effects in spiral MRI using an adaptive data-driven approach. Our results demonstrate that this method significantly improves image quality and reduces the impact of boundary effects on diagnostic accuracy in the PROMISE study. This approach has the potential to enhance the reliability and clinical value of spiral MRI in the evaluation of patients with chest pain.
3420	"The research paper titled ""Stability of Polytropes"" investigates the stability of polytropic gas spheres. The study focuses on the conditions under which the polytropes maintain their equilibrium and the factors that affect their stability. The paper presents numerical simulations of polytropes with different values of the polytropic index and discusses the impact of rotation and magnetic fields on their stability. The findings indicate that the stability of polytropes is mainly influenced by the polytropic index and rotation, while the magnetic field has a minor effect. The paper concludes that polytropes with higher values of the polytropic index and slower rotation tend to be more stable."
1437	This research paper explores the concept of selection moment in biological evolution through Fourier analysis. The study highlights the importance of this concept in understanding the dynamics of evolution and proposes a new approach to analyzing selection moments. The outcomes of this research shed light on the complex nature of evolution and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of natural selection. Overall, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes that shape the evolution of life on Earth.
3997	"Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature. The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer theories. They have then listed 9 ""absolute discrepancies"" for such cancer theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out."
1929	This research paper examines the role of narratives within immersive technologies, exploring how they can enhance user experience and engagement. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the paper explores the different types of narratives that can be incorporated into immersive technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The paper also highlights the potential benefits of using narratives within immersive technologies, such as increased emotional connection and improved learning outcomes. Ultimately, the paper concludes that incorporating narratives within immersive technologies can enhance user experiences and lead to more engaging and effective interactions.
2364	"This work is dedicated to a new completely algebraic approach to Arakelov geometry, which doesn't require the variety under consideration to be generically smooth or projective. In order to construct such an approach we develop a theory of generalized rings and schemes, which include classical rings and schemes together with ""exotic"" objects such as F_1 (""field with one element""), Z_\infty (""real integers""), T (tropical numbers) etc., thus providing a systematic way of studying such objects. This theory of generalized rings and schemes is developed up to construction of algebraic K-theory, intersection theory and Chern classes. Then existence of Arakelov models of algebraic varieties over Q is shown, and our general results are applied to such models."
2781	"The research paper titled ""On the exact formula for neutrino oscillation probability"" by Kimura, Takamura, and Yokomakura presents an exact formula for calculating the probability of neutrino oscillation, which takes into account the effects of matter and the Earth's density profile. The authors show that the new formula agrees well with experimental data and can be used to improve predictions for future neutrino experiments. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of neutrino oscillations and offers a valuable contribution to the field of particle physics."
2218	In this paper we present a new algebraic structure (a super hyperbolic system in our terminology) for finite quantum systems, which is a generalization of the usual one in the two-level system. It fits into the so-called generalized Pauli matrices, so they play an important role in the theory. Some deep relation to the modified Bessel functions of integer order is pointed out. By taking a skillful limit finite quantum systems become quantum mechanics on the circle developed by Ohnuki and Kitakado.
2225	This research paper aimed to investigate the shock and release temperatures in molybdenum. The study utilized a combination of experimental and computational techniques to determine the temperature at which the material undergoes shock and release processes. The results showed that the shock temperature in molybdenum is around 1200 K, while the release temperature is approximately 1500 K. The findings of this study not only provide valuable insights into the behavior of molybdenum under high-pressure conditions but also have important implications for the design of high-temperature materials for use in extreme environments. Overall, this research paper highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental properties of materials under different conditions and provides a basis for further research in this area.
1388	This research paper examines the evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, specifically in relation to biodiversity cycles. The concept of biodiversity cycles suggests that there are regular, predictable patterns in the rise and fall of species diversity over time, and that these patterns may be linked to astronomical and/or geological cycles. This paper reexamines the evidence for biodiversity cycles, drawing on recent developments in paleontological and statistical methods. The results suggest that while there is some evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, the case for biodiversity cycles is far from conclusive. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this area, and by identifying some of the key challenges and opportunities for future work.
2993	"The research paper titled ""Finite bias visibility of the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer"" focuses on studying the visibility of electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) at finite biases. MZIs are used in quantum computing to manipulate and control the state of qubits. The paper presents a theoretical study of the visibility of these MZIs and how it changes with the applied bias voltage. The researchers found that the visibility of the MZI decreases as the bias voltage increases, which can lead to errors in quantum operations. They also demonstrated that the visibility can be controlled and improved by adjusting the phase of the MZI. The paper concludes that understanding the visibility of MZIs at finite biases is crucial for the development of reliable quantum computing devices."
3085	This research paper proposes a hierarchical approach for dependability analysis of a commercial cache-based RAID storage architecture. The aim is to identify potential failures in the system and evaluate their impact on the overall performance of the storage system. The proposed approach involves the use of fault tree analysis and Markov models to analyze the system's dependability at different levels of abstraction. The results obtained from the analysis show that the proposed approach is effective in identifying potential failures and their impact on the system's performance. The approach can also be used to optimize the system's design and improve its overall dependability.
3106	Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are reduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and archived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The data-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over the lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and the format of the resulting calibrated data files.
2997	The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed states is studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrence two pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the same entanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtained inequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even in infinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in terms of those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can find useful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a given pure state.
3692	Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
279	This research paper presents a family of equations of state (EoS) based on lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that accurately describes the properties of strongly interacting matter, which is crucial for understanding the flow in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The EoS model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data and simulations, indicating the importance of incorporating lattice QCD into EoS calculations. The results suggest that the use of this family of EoS in simulations of heavy-ion collisions can lead to a better understanding of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and provide insights into the dynamics of the early universe.
449	We present an experimental study of the dynamics underlying the buildup and decay of dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a single semiconductor quantum dot. Our experiment shows that the nuclei can be polarized on a time scale of a few milliseconds, while their decay dynamics depends drastically on external parameters. We show that a single electron can very efficiently depolarize the nuclear spins and discuss two processes that can cause this depolarization. Conversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear spin polarization is on the time scale of a second, most likely limited by the non-secular terms of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. We can further suppress this depolarization rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude by applying an external magnetic field exceeding 1 mT.
3601	"The research paper titled ""The alternating sign matrix polytope"" investigates a mathematical object called the alternating sign matrix polytope (ASMP). The ASMP is a convex polytope that can be defined as the set of all real-valued matrices whose entries are either 0 or 1 and satisfy certain conditions. The authors of this paper study the geometric and combinatorial properties of the ASMP, including its volume, facet structure, and connections to other mathematical objects such as the tessellation of a hyperplane arrangement. They also provide a characterization of the vertices of the ASMP and prove that it is the convex hull of a finite set of points. The main conclusion of the paper is that the ASMP is a rich and interesting mathematical object that has important applications in various fields such as combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and statistical mechanics."

It presents the theoretical framework and mathematical models that explain the relationship between electroweak symmetry breaking and scale invariance. The paper also discusses the implications of this concept in the context of particle physics and the Standard Model. The main outcome of this research is the identification of the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, which plays a crucial role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The conclusion drawn from this study is that the Higgs boson is essential in providing mass to fundamental particles and that its discovery is a significant milestone in the field of particle physics.
1018	"A class of interacting classical random fields is constructed using deformed *-algebras of creation and annihilation operators. The fields constructed are classical random field versions of ""Lie fields"". A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the fields constructed are ""quantum random fields"" in the sense that they have Poincare invariant vacua with a fluctuation scale determined by Planck's constant. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle interpretation of a quantum field theory."
3149	This research paper presents the results of a simultaneous monitoring campaign of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005 using the Swift and REM telescopes. Blazars are a type of active galactic nuclei that exhibit extreme variability in their emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The simultaneous monitoring campaign was conducted to investigate the correlation between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar PKS0537-441. The paper presents the light curves and spectral energy distributions obtained from the joint observations and analyzes the variability patterns in both energy bands. The results show a complex interplay between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar, indicating the need for simultaneous monitoring campaigns to fully understand the physics of blazar emission.
2739	This research paper proposes a new approach for measuring wave velocities in heterogeneous materials that considers the local properties of the medium. The proposed method involves measuring the wave velocity at multiple locations and then calculating a local average velocity. The results show that this approach provides a more accurate measurement of wave velocities compared to traditional methods that assume a homogeneous medium. This new approach can be useful in various fields such as seismology, geophysics, and materials science. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering local variations in wave velocities for a better understanding of the properties of heterogeneous materials.
1888	We consider the small time semi-classical limit for nonlinear Schrodinger equations with defocusing, smooth, nonlinearity. For a super-cubic nonlinearity, the limiting system is not directly hyperbolic, due to the presence of vacuum. To overcome this issue, we introduce new unknown functions, which are defined nonlinearly in terms of the wave function itself. This approach provides a local version of the modulated energy functional introduced by Y.Brenier. The system we obtain is hyperbolic symmetric, and the justification of WKB analysis follows.
1572	We discuss a general combinatorial framework for operator ordering problems by applying it to the normal ordering of the powers and exponential of the boson number operator. The solution of the problem is given in terms of Bell and Stirling numbers enumerating partitions of a set. This framework reveals several inherent relations between ordering problems and combinatorial objects, and displays the analytical background to Wick's theorem. The methodology can be straightforwardly generalized from the simple example given herein to a wide class of operators.
2004	The research paper proposes a joint universal lossy coding and identification scheme for stationary mixing sources. The main theme of the paper is to develop a method that can efficiently compress and identify mixed sources without prior knowledge of the mixing process. The proposed method is based on a combination of universal lossy coding and maximum likelihood estimation. The paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of compression rate and identification accuracy. The noteworthy conclusion of the paper is that the joint universal lossy coding and identification scheme provides a promising approach for compressing and identifying mixed sources in various applications, such as signal processing and data compression.
2361	"The research paper titled ""Adhesion forces due to nano-triboelectrification between similar materials"" aims to investigate the effect of electrostatic forces on the adhesion behavior of similar materials at the nanoscale. The study employs atomic force microscopy to measure the adhesion forces between two identical materials under different conditions, including varying relative humidity and contact time. The results reveal that the adhesion forces are significantly influenced by the accumulation of surface charges due to triboelectrification. The study concludes that the electrostatic forces play a crucial role in determining the adhesion behavior between similar materials, and a deeper understanding of these forces is essential for various applications, including nanofabrication and material science."
D2-29	Synthetic biology emerged as a specialized branch of bioengineering over the last 15-20 years, propelled by the technologies of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis. The emphasis is now on characterizing molecular components and standardizing them so that they work together. Today, computer programming languages have become more abstract by building upon previous languages, making it easier and faster to create complex programs. Similarly, in the future, standardized molecular components will make biology understandable through abstraction. This will in turn make it easier to engineer new functions. Of course any biological abstraction would rely on molecular details (just like all computer code is finally executed as assembly), so studying molecular biology is very worthwhile.
1874	The general solutions of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for the conformal (or Weyl, or trace) anomalies are derived. The solutions are obtained, in arbitrary dimensions, by explicitly computing the cohomology of the corresponding Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin differential in the space of integrated local functions at ghost number unity. This provides a purely algebraic, regularization-independent classification of the Weyl anomalies in arbitrary dimensions. The so-called type-A anomaly is shown to satisfy a non-trivial descent of equations, similarly to the non-Abelian chiral anomaly in Yang-Mills theory.
3949	This research paper presents an instanton representation of Plebanski gravity and examines the consistency of initial value constraints under time evolution. The study reveals that the instanton method provides a powerful tool for studying the properties of the theory. Moreover, the researchers conclude that the initial value constraints are invariant under time evolution, which supports the consistency of the theory. These findings suggest that the instanton representation of Plebanski gravity can serve as a useful framework for further exploration of the theory's properties.
1981	The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junctions (npn or pnp) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.
940	The article is devoted to the investigation of groups of diffeomorphisms and loops of manifolds over ultra-metric fields of zero and positive characteristics. Different types of topologies are considered on groups of loops and diffeomorphisms relative to which they are generalized Lie groups or topological groups. Among such topologies pairwise incomparable are found as well. Topological perfectness of the diffeomorphism group relative to certain topologies is studied. There are proved theorems about projective limit decompositions of these groups and their compactifications for compact manifolds. Moreover, an existence of one-parameter local subgroups of diffeomorphism groups is investigated.
3724	"The research paper titled ""Rigid subsets of symplectic manifolds"" focuses on the study of subsets of symplectic manifolds that are rigid in the sense that they cannot be deformed without changing their symplectic structure. The authors prove that certain classes of subsets, such as Lagrangian submanifolds, are rigid and investigate the consequences of this rigidity on the geometry and topology of the symplectic manifold. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of these results for the study of Hamiltonian dynamics on symplectic manifolds. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the behavior of symplectic manifolds and their subsets under deformation."
2276	Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance. We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the Fermi velocity.
D2-46	"Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, though it does not directly cause the disease. The connection between these conditions is so significant that healthcare professionals have coined the term ""diabesity"" to highlight that the majority of individuals with diabetes are obese or overweight demonstrates that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases linearly with rising body mass index. This explains why the worldwide increase in obesity prevalence has led to a corresponding surge in type 2 diabetes cases globally. The relationship works through several mechanisms: excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, affects insulin sensitivity and function. Some individuals with obesity can produce more insulin without overtaxing the pancreasy."
3130	This research paper presents a novel approach to recovering the star formation and metallicity histories of galaxies from their spectra using VESPA (Visible and Infrared Extragalactic Spectral and Photometric Analysis). VESPA is a powerful tool that combines spectral fitting and Bayesian inference to extract information about the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. We apply this method to a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and demonstrate the effectiveness of VESPA in recovering the star formation and metallicity histories of these galaxies. Our results show that VESPA is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of galaxies and can provide insights into the physical processes that drive their formation and evolution. The implications of these results for our understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.
1712	We observe that when a local patch in a radiation filled Robertson-Walker universe inflates by some reason, outside perturbations can enter into the inflating region. Generally, the physical wavelengths of these perturbations become larger than the Hubble radius as they cross into the inflating space and their amplitudes freeze out immediately. It turns out that the corresponding power spectrum is not scale invariant. Although these perturbations cannot reach out to a distance inner observer shielded by a de Sitter horizon, they still indicate a curious boundary effect in local inflationary scenarios.
2277	This research paper investigates the impact of interaction on contact links in enhancing transport. The study utilizes a model system of charged particles in a random network and finds that when particles interact on contact links, the transport is significantly enhanced. The study also identifies the key factors that drive the enhancement, including the strength and density of the interactions. The findings suggest that the presence of interaction on contact links can play a critical role in the transport properties of complex systems.
3463	This research paper presents a k-dependent SU(4) model of high-temperature superconductivity and its coherent-state solutions. The central focus of the study is to investigate the underlying mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity using a unified approach. The key findings suggest that the k-dependent SU(4) model provides an effective description of the high-temperature superconductivity phenomenon. Additionally, the coherent-state solutions reveal the emergence of nontrivial order parameters, which could play a crucial role in understanding the superconductivity mechanism. Overall, this study offers a valuable contribution to the field of condensed matter physics and sheds light on the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.
2855	Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.
2332	This research paper explores the use of universal 2+1-dimensional plane equations in general relativity and its application in understanding the evolutions of disk nebula. The study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the mathematical models and equations that are used in general relativity to describe the behavior of disk nebula. Through a thorough investigation of the properties of disk nebula and the principles of general relativity, the research paper aims to discover new insights into the behavior of these cosmic phenomena and how they evolve over time. The research findings could provide valuable information for future studies on the origins and evolution of the universe.
1645	An acousto-optic cell was used to reduce the speckle noise that reduces the quality of Hartmann-Shack and other wave-front sensors measuring ocular aberrations. In the method presented here, a laser beam traverses an acousto-optic cell, interacting with standing acoustic waves. Speckle reduction takes place as the incoming beam is diffractively spread across the cornea. The increased size and the wider angular spread of the incoming beam average out the speckles, producing a more uniform response of the wave-front sensor.
D2-75	"The Big Bang theory is an effort to explain what happened at the very beginning of our universe. Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing; during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment. According to the standard theory, our universe sprang into existence as ""singularity"" around 13.7 billion years ago. What is a ""singularity"" and where does it come from? Well, Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of ""black holes."""
3783	Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a pulse doublet sequence.
1260	This research paper explores the chemical properties of star-forming dwarf galaxies. The main objective of this study is to understand the chemical evolution of these galaxies and the factors that influence their chemical abundances. The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of a sample of star-forming dwarf galaxies using spectroscopic observations. They found that these galaxies have a lower metallicity compared to larger galaxies, which indicates that they have undergone different chemical evolution processes. Additionally, the authors found a correlation between the star formation rate and the metallicity of the galaxies, suggesting that star formation can affect the chemical composition of these galaxies. Overall, this study provides important insights into the chemical properties of star-forming dwarf galaxies and highlights the need for further research in this area.
534	The article discusses the circular motion of two particles with unequal masses in the context of post-Minkowski approximation. The study uses the Hamiltonian formalism to derive the equations of motion and obtain solutions for the system. The main focus is on analyzing the effects of post-Minkowski corrections on the circular orbits of the particles. The study finds that the post-Minkowski corrections have a significant impact on the motion of the particles, altering their orbital parameters such as the radius and frequency. The authors conclude that the post-Minkowski corrections must be taken into account when analyzing the motion of particles in circular orbits, particularly in the context of high-precision experiments or astrophysical scenarios.
3667	This research paper explores the integration of general system theory, like-quantum semantics, and fuzzy sets. The primary focus is on the application of these theories in understanding complex systems and developing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing them. The noteworthy findings suggest that the combination of these theories can enhance the understanding of complex systems and provide a more accurate representation of their behaviors and interactions. Additionally, the research highlights the potential for further development and application of these theories in various fields, including engineering, social sciences, and management.
1288	This research paper investigates the charge polarization effects and hole spectra characteristics in AlxGai-xN/GaN superlattices. The study uses theoretical calculations to analyze the structures of the superlattices and their electronic properties. The results show that the charge polarization effect significantly influences the hole spectra characteristics, leading to the formation of multiple hole states. Moreover, the Al content in the superlattices has a crucial role in determining the hole spectra characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of AlxGai-xN/GaN superlattices for electronic and optoelectronic applications.
1569	"The research paper titled ""Topological Winding and Unwinding in Metastable Bose-Einstein Condensates"" explores the behavior of a metastable Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subjected to a rotating potential. The study focuses on the formation of topological defects, specifically vortices, in the BEC and how they evolve over time. The authors investigate the dynamics of the vortices and their interactions with other defects, such as antivortices. They find that the vortices can undergo a process of unwinding, in which they merge with antivortices and disappear, or winding, in which they split and create new vortices. The study provides insight into the behavior of metastable BECs and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications."
1861	We present a new code for calculating the Fe Kalpha line profiles from relativistic accretion disks with finite thickness around a rotating black hole. The thin Keplerian accretion disk must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion rates. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic computation which is aimed at gaining an insight into the effects of geometrical thickness and the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. This code is also well-suited to produce accretion disk images.
658	This research paper focuses on the effects of extragalactic background light (EBL) on cascading in the universe. The study utilizes numerical simulations to demonstrate how the presence of EBL can affect the propagation and scattering of high-energy photons from distant sources. The results indicate that EBL can significantly impact the observed spectra of gamma-ray sources, with implications for our understanding of the universe's evolution and the nature of high-energy astrophysical processes. The study concludes that a more comprehensive understanding of EBL is essential for accurately interpreting observations of extragalactic gamma-ray sources and for improving our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties.
926	The research paper discusses the development of an artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback system that can be used for the perceptual supplementation of individuals with disabilities. The system includes a tongue-placed tactile display that can provide sensory feedback to users, allowing them to perceive and interact with their environment in a more effective manner. The study also explores the potential applications of this technology in the field of biomedical engineering, particularly in the development of prosthetic devices. The authors conclude that the artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback system has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and could have important implications for the field of biomedical engineering.
D1-18	The question of how many eggs one should eat per day is often debated due to concerns about cholesterol and cardiovascular health. Current research suggests that consuming up to three eggs per day can be part of a healthy diet for most people, particularly young, healthy adults. Consuming up to three eggs per day has been shown to increase HDL (good) cholesterol and improve the LDL/HDL ratio, which are favorable changes for cardiovascular health. For most healthy individuals, consuming up to three eggs per day can be beneficial, improving cholesterol profiles and providing essential nutrients without increasing cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with specific health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should consider their overall dietary patterns.
1342	"This research paper investigates the nature of ""EIT waves,"" a type of wave observed in the Sun's corona. Using observations from multiple spacecraft and simulations, the authors analyze the properties of these waves and compare them to theoretical models of fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The results suggest that ""EIT waves"" are indeed fast-mode MHD waves, providing important insights into the dynamics of the solar corona and the propagation of waves in a magnetized plasma. These findings have implications for understanding space weather and the potential impact of solar activity on Earth."
1937	The paper proposes a new approach for inferring dynamic genetic networks using low order independencies. The method is based on partial correlation and uses a dynamic Bayesian network to model the time-varying relationships between genes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on simulated data and a real-world gene expression dataset. The results show that the approach is able to accurately infer the underlying network structure and identify important regulatory interactions. This method provides a promising tool for studying complex genetic systems and may have practical applications in personalized medicine and drug development.
3268	This research paper presents a physically sound Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamical Casimir effect, a phenomenon where a vacuum is induced to produce real particles due to the time-varying boundary conditions of a cavity. The primary theme of the paper is to develop a rigorous mathematical framework that accurately describes the dynamics of the system and provides a physically intuitive understanding of the effect. The research findings suggest that the proposed Hamiltonian formulation provides a more accurate and complete description of the dynamical Casimir effect compared to previous formulations. The conclusions drawn from the study provide valuable insights into the physics of the effect and can aid in the design and development of experimental systems to observe the phenomenon.
222	We present the structure of the fully relaxed (001) surface of the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, calculated using density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Two relevant ferroelastic order parameters are identified and characterized: The tilting of the oxygen octahedra, which is present in the bulk phase, oscillates and decreases towards the surface, and an additional ferrodistortive Mn off-centering, triggered by the surface, decays monotonically into the bulk. The narrow d-like energy band that is characteristic of unrelaxed manganite surfaces is shifted down in energy by these structural distortions, retaining its uppermost layer localization. The magnitude of the zero-temperature magnetization is unchanged from its bulk value, but the effective spin-spin interactions are reduced at the surface.
3580	We study infinite tree and ultrametric matrices, and their action on the boundary of the tree. For each tree matrix we show the existence of a symmetric random walk associated to it and we study its Green potential. We provide a representation theorem for harmonic functions that includes simple expressions for any increasing harmonic function and the Martin kernel. In the boundary, we construct the Markov kernel whose Green function is the extension of the matrix and we simulate it by using a cascade of killing independent exponential random variables and conditionally independent uniform variables. For ultrametric matrices we supply probabilistic conditions to study its potential properties when immersed in its minimal tree matrix extension.
425	A scheme for coherent manipulation of collective atomic states is developed such that total subradiant states, in which spontaneous emission is suppressed into all directions due to destructive interference between neighbor atoms, can be created in an extended atomic ensemble. The optimal conditions for creation of such states and suitability of them for quantum storage are discussed. It is shown that in order to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio the shape of a light pulse to be stored and reconstructed using a homogeneously broadened absorbtion line of an atomic system should be a time-reversed regular part of the response function of the system. In the limit of high optical density, such pulses allow one to prepare collective subradiant atomic states with near flat spatial distribution of the atomic excitation in the medium.
1765	This research paper explores the nuclear symmetry energy through heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. The central focus is on understanding the relationship between the symmetry energy and the properties of neutron-rich nuclei. The outcomes of the study suggest that the nuclear symmetry energy is a crucial factor in determining the behavior of neutron-rich nuclei and can be probed effectively through heavy-ion reactions. The conclusion highlights the importance of these findings in advancing our understanding of nuclear physics and in developing models for astrophysical processes involving neutron-rich matter.
2456	Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and statistics scale with various parameters.
772	This research paper focuses on the development of reliable memory structures from unreliable components. The key objective of the study is to explore the use of expander graphs as a means of achieving reliable memory structures. The paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of expander graphs in memory design. The authors propose a new design methodology that combines expander graphs with traditional memory design techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. The results show that the use of expander graphs can significantly improve the reliability of memory structures. The study concludes that expander graphs are a promising tool for building reliable memories from unreliable components, and that further research is needed to explore their full potential in this area.
D2-11	These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter. People at high risk of not getting enough vitamin D, all children aged 1 to 4, and all babies (unless they're having more than 500ml of infant formula a day) should take a daily supplement throughout the year. There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19).
1783	"The research paper titled ""A study of the size of snow particles in powder snow avalanches"" explores the relationship between the size of snow particles and the occurrence of powder snow avalanches. The study involves collecting data from snow samples in different regions and analyzing the particle size distribution. The authors found that the size of snow particles plays a significant role in the formation and occurrence of powder snow avalanches. The paper concludes that understanding the particle size distribution of snow can help in predicting the likelihood of avalanches and improving safety measures in avalanche-prone areas."
862	We introduce the notion of Differential Sequences of ordinary differential equations. This is motivated by related studies based on evolution partial differential equations. We discuss the Riccati Sequence in terms of symmetry analysis, singularity analysis and identification of the complete symmetry group for each member of the Sequence. The singularity analysis reveals considerable structure for the values of the coefficients of the leading-order terms and resonances of the different principal branches. Full proofs of the symmetry properties are performed for differential equations defined by their recursion properties and not given in explicit form.
1211	The proof of the fact that there are no nontrivial, consistent cross-couplings that can be added between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field is accomplished by means of a cohomological approach, based on the deformation of the solution to the master equation from the antifield-Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. The procedure developed here relies on the assumptions of locality, smoothness, (background) Lorentz invariance, Poincare invariance, and preservation of the number of derivatives with respect to each field (the last hypothesis was made only in antighost number zero).
3037	It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however, suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the importance of relay selection.
120	This research paper investigates how neutral genetic drift can aid functional protein evolution. By analyzing mutations in the protein coding regions of genes, the study shows that neutral mutations can act as a stepping stone for beneficial mutations. These neutral mutations can accumulate over time and create a genetic background that allows for faster evolution of functional proteins when beneficial mutations occur. The findings suggest that neutral genetic drift can play an important role in shaping the evolution of complex biological systems and can help us understand how organisms adapt to changing environments. By understanding the mechanisms that drive protein evolution, we can gain insights into how to engineer proteins for specific applications in biotechnology and medicine.
1263	The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole are nearly Keplerian ellipses. Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits than on circular orbits.
1518	We show that atoms trapped in micro-cavities that interact via exchange of virtual photons can model an anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in an external magnetic field. All parameters of the effective Hamiltonian can individually be tuned via external lasers. Since the occupation of excited atomic levels and photonic states are strongly suppressed, the effective model is robust against decoherence mechanisms, has a long lifetime and its implementation is feasible with current experimental technology. The model provides a feasible way to create cluster states in these devices.
278	We construct a family of equations of state within a quasiparticle model by relating pressure, energy density, baryon density and susceptibilities adjusted to first-principles lattice QCD calculations. The relation between pressure and energy density from lattice QCD is surprisingly insensitive to details of the simulations. Effects from different lattice actions, quark masses and lattice spacings used in the simulations show up mostly in the quark-hadron phase transition region which we bridge over by a set of interpolations to a hadron resonance gas equation of state. Within our optimized quasiparticle model we then examine the equation of state along isentropic expansion trajectories at small net baryon densities, as relevant for experiments and hydrodynamic simulations at RHIC and LHC energies. We illustrate its impact on azimuthal flow anisotropies and transverse momentum spectra of various hadron species.
615	"The research paper titled ""An Integrated Human-Computer System for Controlling Interstate Disputes"" proposes a system that combines human judgment and computer algorithms to facilitate the resolution of interstate disputes. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns, which are then presented to human judges who use their expertise to make informed decisions. The authors argue that this approach could help to reduce bias and increase the efficiency of dispute resolution. The paper concludes that the proposed integrated system has the potential to significantly improve the process of resolving interstate disputes, particularly those that involve complex data sets. However, the authors note that further research and development is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of this approach."
1848	This research paper investigates the use of multiple quantum wells (MQWs) for generating ultra-short passive laser pulses. The main focus of the study is to analyze the impact of various parameters on the pulse generation process, including well width, barrier height, and doping concentration. The results show that well-designed MQWs can significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of laser pulse generation, leading to higher output power and shorter pulse duration. The study also highlights the importance of optimizing the design parameters to achieve the desired pulse characteristics. Overall, the findings suggest that MQWs hold great potential for advancing ultra-short pulse laser technology and its applications in various fields.
2365	This research paper introduces a new approach to Arakelov geometry, which is a mathematical field that studies the intersection between algebraic geometry and complex analysis. The authors propose a new way of defining Arakelov divisors, which are important objects in this field, using ideas from tropical geometry. They then use this new definition to prove several key results, including a version of the Riemann-Roch theorem that holds for Arakelov divisors. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of this new approach to other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and algebraic geometry. Overall, this research presents a promising new avenue for studying Arakelov geometry and its related fields.
1409	"What did ""algebra"" mean before the development of the algebraic theories of the 20th century ? This paper stresses the identities taken by the algebraic practices developped during the century long discussion around the equation around the equation of secular inequalities (1766- 1874). In 1874, a strong controversy on the theory of bilinear and quadratic forms opposed Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker. The arithmetical ideal of Kronecker faced Jordan's claim for the simplicity of his algebraic canonical form. As the controversy combined mathematical and historical arguments, it gave rise to the writing of a history of the methods used by Lagrange, Laplace and Weierstrass in a century long mathematical discussion around the ""equation of secular inequalities""."
3086	A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. We present first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion path probability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result is then used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heat or entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the path uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.
296	The paper presents a theoretical study of the Rashba model, which describes the spin-orbit coupling in semiconductor structures. The authors derive coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion equations that describe the dynamics of spin and charge transport in the presence of the Rashba effect. The equations are solved numerically, and the results show that the Rashba effect can significantly affect the spin and charge transport properties. In particular, the spin Hall effect is enhanced by the Rashba coupling, and the spin and charge currents can exhibit nontrivial spatial profiles. The study provides insights into the interplay between spin and charge transport in semiconductor structures and highlights the importance of including the Rashba effect in the analysis of spintronic devices.
2255	This paper presents an algebraic generalization of Kripke structures, which are commonly used in modal logic to model systems with multiple states. By introducing an algebraic structure based on the lattice of sub-formulas of a given formula, the authors are able to capture the essence of Kripke structures in a more abstract and flexible way. The paper provides a formal definition of this algebraic structure, explores its properties and relationships with other modal logics, and shows how it can be used to reason about complex systems. The authors conclude that their algebraic generalization provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing a wide range of systems, including those that cannot be adequately represented by traditional Kripke structures.
26	This research paper explores the impact of growth parameters on the structural properties and bandgap of InN epilayers deposited using a showerhead MOVPE system. InN epilayers were grown under various growth conditions, including temperature, pressure, and V/III ratio. The structural properties of the grown InN epilayers were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The bandgap of the InN epilayers was measured using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the growth parameters significantly influence the structural properties and bandgap of InN epilayers. The optimal growth conditions for high-quality InN epilayers were found to be a growth temperature of 550  C, a pressure of 200 mbar, and a V/III ratio of 400. This study provides valuable insights into the growth of InN epilayers and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
3923	This research paper proposes a novel model for cascading failures in complex networks that balances high robustness with low cost. The model is based on analyzing the structural properties of the network and identifying key nodes that play a crucial role in maintaining network connectivity. By strategically reinforcing these critical nodes, the model is able to significantly improve the network's ability to withstand failures and prevent cascading effects, while minimizing the associated costs. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through extensive simulations on various types of networks, including power grids, transportation systems, and social networks. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in terms of both robustness and cost-effectiveness, making it a promising solution for improving the resilience of complex networks in practical applications.
3197	We consider an anisotropic brane world with Bianchi type I and V geometries where the mechanism of confining the matter on the brane is through the use of a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the special case of a Bianchi type I the solutions of the field equations are obtained in an exact analytic form. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally important parameters.
1432	This research paper aims to investigate the reason behind the observed lower X-ray luminosity of accreting T Tauri stars when compared to non-accretors. The primary theme is to understand the mechanism of X-ray emission in these stars and to determine how accretion affects their X-ray luminosity. Based on a review of existing literature and analysis of observational data, the study concludes that the lower X-ray luminosity is likely due to the presence of dense accretion disks that absorb and reprocess X-rays. The study also suggests that the accretion process itself may play a role in reducing X-ray emission. These findings have implications for our understanding of star formation and the role of accretion in shaping the properties of young stars.
1048	This research paper investigates the behavior of localized electron states near a metal-semiconductor nanocontact. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe the formation of these states and their dependence on the contact size and applied voltage. Our results suggest that these states arise from the quantum confinement of electrons within the nanocontact, and their energy levels can be tuned by adjusting the contact size and voltage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of these localized states can significantly affect the electronic transport properties of the nanocontact, with implications for the design of nanoscale electronic devices. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the behavior of electron states in metal-semiconductor nanocontacts and their potential applications in nanoelectronics.
1232	"The research paper titled ""Electron-electron correlation in graphite"" studies the electronic properties of graphite using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The study finds significant electron-electron correlation effects in graphite, which cannot be accounted for by DFT alone. The researchers observe a strong correlation-induced narrowing of the valence band, which is consistent with many-body electronic interactions. They also find evidence of a correlation-induced bandgap opening in the graphite electronic structure, which had not previously been observed. These findings have implications for understanding the electronic properties of other materials with similar electronic structures."

The paper also highlights some of the recent advancements in gamma-ray observations and modeling, which have led to improved measurements of the EGB and a better understanding of its origins. The main conclusion of this research is that the EGB is likely produced by a combination of unresolved extragalactic sources, including blazars, star-forming galaxies, and possibly dark matter annihilation.

Overall, NodeTrix has the potential to improve the understanding of complex network structures and facilitate decision-making in various domains.

1278	We explore the possibility of performing nuclear structure studies using low energy neutrino beams. In particular, low energy beta-beams and conventional sources (muon decay-at-rest) are considered. We present results on the total charged-current as well as flux-averaged cross sections associated to electron (anti)-neutrino scattering on oxygen, iron, molybdenum and lead, as typical examples. It is shown that by using neutrinos from low energy beta-beams, information on forbidden states, in particular the spin-dipole, could be extracted.
3813	We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.
3358	This research paper focuses on the high-mass star formation process and the dynamical evolution of Orion Source I on 10-100 AU scales using SiO masers. The researchers utilized the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to obtain high-resolution images of the SiO masers and analyzed the data to understand the physical properties of the masers and their location relative to the central protostar. The results of the study reveal that the SiO masers trace the outflowing gas and the rotation of the circumstellar disk around the protostar. The findings provide critical insights into the early stages of high-mass star formation and the role of SiO masers in probing the dynamical evolution of protostellar systems.
69	We propose a generic test for models in which gravity is modified to do away with dark matter. These models tend to have gravitons couple to a different metric than ordinary matter. A strong test of such models comes from comparing the arrival time of the gravitational wave pulse from a cosmological event such as a supernova with the arrival times of the associated pulses of neutrinos and photons. For SN 1987a we show that the gravity wave would have arrived 5.3 days after the neutrino pulse.
3558	By using only combinatorial data on two posets X and Y, we construct a set of so-called formulas. A formula produces simultaneously, for any abelian category A, a functor between the categories of complexes of diagrams over X and Y with values in A. This functor induces a triangulated functor between the corresponding derived categories. This allows us to prove, for pairs X, Y of posets sharing certain common underlying combinatorial structure, that for any abelian category A, regardless of its nature, the categories of diagrams over X and Y with values in A are derived equivalent.
2049	Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we find a reasonable agreement.
3797	We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine. Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability measures.
1574	A new class of space time codes with high performance is presented. The code design utilizes tailor-made permutation codes, which are known to have large minimal distances as spherical codes. A geometric connection between spherical and space time codes has been used to translate them into the final space time codes. Simulations demonstrate that the performance increases with the block lengths, a result that has been conjectured already in previous work. Further, the connection to permutation codes allows for moderate complex en-/decoding algorithms.
D1-25	Although the earliest life seems to have arisen quite soon in Earth’s history, less than 800 million years after its formation, simple forms continued for 1.6 billion years until the multicellular Francevillian biota developed and quickly died out about 2.1 billion years ago. After that, although multicellular forms were in existence from about 1.7 billion years ago, it was not until the Cambrian ‘explosion’ from 540–500 million years ago that multicellular life expanded and prospered. This is essentially what we know. But fossilisation is rare and early life has resulted in tiny traces  difficult to interpret. At present there are believed to be about one trillion species on Earth, less than one per cent of those which have ever lived.
3787	We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novel quantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a single photon. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degree of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test some of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of state non-classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantum information terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they can produce.
3300	Hydrocarbon anions have been detected in various interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes, providing important insights into the chemical processes occurring in these environments. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the detection, properties, and formation mechanisms of hydrocarbon anions in interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes. Theoretical and experimental studies of the structures and reactivity of these anions are discussed, with a particular focus on their potential roles in the formation of larger organic molecules. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the origin of life and the evolution of planetary systems are also considered. Overall, the detection of hydrocarbon anions in these environments highlights the richness and complexity of interstellar chemistry and underscores the importance of continued research in this field.
2676	We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion. The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of approximating this functional significantly.
3044	Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
1090	This research paper focuses on the simulation of ASTROD I test mass charging caused by solar energetic particles. The primary theme is to understand the effect of space environment on the charging of test masses. The study reveals that the charging rates of the test mass increase with the energy of the incident particles. The results suggest that the charging effects must be considered while designing future space missions. The research concludes that the charging effects on the test mass can impact the accuracy of the mission and must be accounted for in the design phase.
3614	We report on use of a radiation pressure induced restoring force, the optical spring effect, to optically dilute the mechanical damping of a 1 gram suspended mirror, which is then cooled by active feedback (cold damping). Optical dilution relaxes the limit on cooling imposed by mechanical losses, allowing the oscillator mode to reach a minimum temperature of 6.9 mK, a factor of ~40000 below the environmental temperature. A further advantage of the optical spring effect is that it can increase the number of oscillations before decoherence by several orders of magnitude. In the present experiment we infer an increase in the dynamical lifetime of the state by a factor of ~200.
1189	"The research paper titled ""Predicting the connectivity of primate cortical networks from topological and spatial node properties"" focuses on understanding the patterns of connectivity in primate cortical networks. The study found that there is a strong relationship between the spatial location of cortical nodes and their connectivity patterns, with nodes that are closer together tending to have more connections. Additionally, the study found that certain topological features of the network, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, were also predictive of connectivity patterns. Overall, the study suggests that both spatial and topological properties are important in understanding the organization of primate cortical networks and may have implications for understanding brain function and dysfunction."
3616	We have developed a linearization method to investigate the subthreshold oscillatory behaviors in nonlinear autonomous systems. By considering firstly the neuronal system as an example, we show that this theoretical approach can predict quantitatively the subthreshold oscillatory activities, including the damping coefficients and the oscillatory frequencies which are in good agreement with those observed in experiments. Then we generalize the linearization method to an arbitrary autonomous nonlinear system. The detailed extension of this theoretical approach is also presented and further discussed.

We analyze the time evolution of the entanglement of the atoms and photons using the concurrence and entropy measures. Different initial states of the system are considered, and the entanglement behavior is studied under various system parameters such as coupling strength and detuning. Our results show that the entanglement dynamics are highly dependent on the initial state and system parameters. We also observe that the entanglement between the atoms and photons can be sustained for longer periods of time under certain conditions. These findings have implications for quantum information processing and quantum communication using two-qubit and two-mode systems.
4011	We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.

Overall, this research provides new insights into the complex processes that govern the evolution of stars and their properties.
358	We introduce a new model for the dynamics of a wormlike chain in an environment that gives rise to a rough free energy landscape, which we baptise the glassy wormlike chain. It is obtained from the common wormlike chain by an exponential stretching of the relaxation spectrum of its long-wavelength eigenmodes, controlled by a single stretching parameter. Predictions for pertinent observables such as the dynamic structure factor and the microrheological susceptibility exhibit the characteristics of soft glassy rheology and compare favourably with experimental data for reconstituted cytoskeletal networks and live cells. We speculate about the possible microscopic origin of the stretching, implications for the nonlinear rheology, and the potential physiological significance of our results.
3556	Starting with two light clocks to derive time dilation expression, as many textbooks do, and then adding a third one, we work on relativistic spacetime coordinates relations for some simple events as emission, reflection and return of light pulses. Besides time dilation, we get, in the following order, Doppler k-factor, addition of velocities, length contraction, Lorentz Transformations and spacetime interval invariance. We also use Minkowski spacetime diagram to show how to interpret some few events in terms of spacetime coordinates in three different inertial frames.
3345	The conformational behavior of a giant DNA mediated by condensing agents in the bulk solution has been investigated through experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, a pronounced conformational hysteresis is observed for folding and unfolding processes, by increasing and decreasing the concentration of condensing agent PEG (Polyethylene glycol), respectively. To elucidate the observed hysteresis, a semiflexible chain model is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations for the coil-globule transition. In the simulations, the hysteresis loop emerges for stiff enough chains, indicating distinct pathways for folding and unfolding processes. Also, our results show that globular state is thermodynamically more stable than coiled state in the hysteresis loop. Our findings suggest that increasing chain stiffness may reduce the chain conformations relevant to the folding pathway, which impedes the folding process.

In this research paper, we investigate the use of St\""uckelberg interferometry to manipulate and control the internal states of ultracold molecules. Our results demonstrate the ability to create coherent superpositions of molecular states, and to observe interference effects that reveal important information about the molecular dynamics. Additionally, we explore the potential applications of St\""uckelberg interferometry in quantum information processing and precision measurement. These findings open up exciting new avenues for the study and control of ultracold molecules, with promising implications for a range of scientific and technological fields."
165	Microfabrication of graphene devices used in many experimental studies currently relies on the fact that graphene crystallites can be visualized using optical microscopy if prepared on top of silicon wafers with a certain thickness of silicon dioxide. We study graphene's visibility and show that it depends strongly on both thickness of silicon dioxide and light wavelength. We have found that by using monochromatic illumination, graphene can be isolated for any silicon dioxide thickness, albeit 300 nm (the current standard) and, especially, approx. 100 nm are most suitable for its visual detection. By using a Fresnel-law-based model, we quantitatively describe the experimental data without any fitting parameters.

The study also highlights the importance of high-resolution imaging in understanding the processes that govern the evolution of Seyfert galaxies.
2312	The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton states in molecular complexes has been proposed.
3455	The electromagnetic field inside a cubic cavity filled up with a linear magnetodielectric medium and in the presence of external charges is quantized by modelling the magnetodielectric medium with two independent quantum fields. Electric and magnetic polarization densities of the medium are defined in terms of the ladder operators of the medium and eigenmodes of the cavity. Maxwell and constitutive equations of the medium together with the equation of motion of the charged particles have been obtained from the Heisenberg equations using a minimal coupling scheme. Spontaneous emission of a two level atom embedded in a magnetodielectric medium is calculated in terms of electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium and the Green function of the cubic cavity as an application of the model.
260	The research paper proposes a new method for creating and propagating order along Ising spin chains using geodesics. The authors demonstrate that geodesics, which are the shortest paths between two points on a curved surface, can be used to efficiently transfer information between distant spins in the chain. They show that their method is more efficient than traditional methods such as quantum annealing and simulated annealing. The authors conclude that geodesics provide a promising approach for creating and manipulating order in spin chains, with potential applications in fields such as quantum computing and machine learning.
1951	This research paper presents an inverse Monte-Carlo approach to determine effective lattice models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature.

The effective model parameters are optimized to reproduce the thermodynamic observables of the Yang-Mills theory, such as the energy density and pressure. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the inverse Monte-Carlo approach in determining accurate effective models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. This research has important implications for the development of effective models for non-perturbative studies of quantum chromodynamics.
3948	The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell's equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.

The primary focus is on understanding the role of magnetic fields in the solar cycle and how they can be incorporated into predictive models. The authors use observational data and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of mean-field models in predicting the solar cycle. The paper concludes that mean-field models are a valuable tool for predicting the solar cycle and improving our understanding of the Sun's magnetic activity.
1235	We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.

763	We elaborate an unified geometric approach to classical mechanics, Riemann-Finsler spaces and gravity theories on Lie algebroids provided with nonlinear connection (N-connection) structure. There are investigated the conditions when the fundamental geometric objects like the anchor, metric and linear connection, almost sympletic and related almost complex structures may be canonically defined by a N-connection induced from a regular Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian), in mechanical models, or by generic off-diagonal metric terms and nonholonomic frames, in gravity theories. Such geometric constructions are modelled on nonholonomic manifolds provided with nonintegrable distributions and related chains of exact sequences of submanifolds defining N-connections. We investigate the main properties of the Lagrange, Hamilton, Finsler-Riemann and Einstein-Cartan algebroids and construct and analyze exact solutions describing such objects.
1183	This research paper investigates the entanglement and topological entropy of the toric code at finite temperature. The toric code is a topologically ordered quantum spin system that is highly entangled, making it a promising candidate for quantum error correction. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the entanglement properties and topological entropy of the toric code at finite temperature. The results show that the entanglement entropy increases with temperature, while the topological entropy remains constant. The study also demonstrates that topological entropy can be used as a measure of the stability of the topological order. These findings have important implications for the development of quantum error correction codes and the understanding of topologically ordered systems.
337	We review recent results from the X-ray timing of accreting millisecond pulsars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries. This is the first time a timing analysis is performed on accreting millisecond pulsars, and for the first time we can obtain information on the behavior of a very fast pulsar subject to accretion torques. We find both spin-up and spin-down behaviors, from which, using available models for the accretion torques, we derive information on the mass accretion rate and magnetic field of the neutron star in these systems. We also find that the phase delays behavior as a function of time in these sources is sometimes quite complex and difficult to interpret, since phase shifts, most probably driven by variations of the X-ray flux, are sometimes present.

The conclusion drawn from this research is that the relativistic diffusion equation can be derived from the stochastic quantization method, which provides a new perspective on the formulation of the equation and its applications in various fields of physics.
1319	We elucidate the mechanism of cold denaturation through constant-pressure simulations for a model of hydrophobic molecules in an explicit solvent. We find that the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect is the driving force/induces/facilitates cold denaturation. The physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon is identified as the destabilization of hydrophobic contact in favor of solvent separated configurations, the same mechanism seen in pressure induced denaturation. A phenomenological explanation proposed for the mechanism is suggested as being responsible for cold denaturation in real proteins.
1001	This paper explores the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in selective-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The authors propose a selective-fading MIMO channel model and derive the DMT for this model using an outage probability analysis. They also compare the performance of different MIMO schemes, including space-time codes and beamforming, in terms of their achievable DMT. The findings suggest that beamforming can achieve higher multiplexing gains than space-time codes, but at the cost of reduced diversity gains. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering the DMT when designing MIMO systems for selective-fading channels.

The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the physicochemical properties of the two forms of L-alanine zwitterion, which can have significant implications in the development of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology applications.
3220	The article discusses the use of the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows to probe the structure of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. The author explains that the steep decay phase is caused by the interaction between the GRB jet and its surrounding medium, which can provide valuable information about the jet's properties. By analyzing the steep decay phase, researchers can determine the jet's collimation angle, energy, and magnetic field strength. The article also highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations in studying GRBs, as they provide a more complete picture of the event. The author concludes that studying the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows is a promising approach to understanding the structure and properties of GRB jets.
2660	We introduce a novel extension of the Gutzwiller variational wavefunction able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we find that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron repulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.
2242	We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by tens of thousands wavelengths.
3457	We establish a one-to-one correspondence between one-sided and two-sided regular systems of conditional probabilities on the half-line that preserves the associated chains and Gibbs measures. As an application, we determine uniqueness and non-uniqueness regimes in one-sided versions of ferromagnetic Ising models with long range interactions. Our study shows that the interplay between chain and Gibbsian theories yields more information than that contained within the known theory of each separate framework. In particular: (i) A Gibbsian construction due to Dyson yields a new family of chains with phase transitions; (ii) these transitions show that a square summability uniqueness condition of chains is false in the general non-shift-invariant setting, and (iii) an uniqueness criterion for chains shows that a Gibbsian conjecture due to Kac and Thompson is false in this half-line setting.
2973	This research paper investigates the long-range correlation and multifractality of pitch series in Bach's Inventions. Through the use of multifractal analysis, we explore the complex and self-similar patterns within the musical structures of Bach's compositions. Our findings suggest that the pitch sequences in Bach's Inventions exhibit multifractal behavior, indicating a high degree of complexity and variability in the music. Additionally, we observe long-range correlations within the pitch series, revealing a persistent structure that extends throughout the entire composition. These results provide insight into the intricate and sophisticated musical structures of Bach's works and may have implications for understanding the underlying principles of music composition.
2790	This research paper focuses on analyzing the optimal flexibility required for conformational transitions in macromolecules. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a range of macromolecules to investigate the correlation between flexibility and conformational transitions. The results demonstrate that optimal flexibility allows for efficient transitions between different conformations, and that rigid macromolecules require significant energy to undergo conformational changes. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering flexibility in the design of macromolecules for various applications in biotechnology and drug discovery. Overall, the findings suggest that optimal flexibility is a critical factor for conformational transitions in macromolecules and can significantly impact their functionality.
988	This article presents a model of general-purpose computing on a semantic network substrate. The concepts presented are applicable to any semantic network representation. However, due to the standards and technological infrastructure devoted to the Semantic Web effort, this article is presented from this point of view. In the proposed model of computing, the application programming interface, the run-time program, and the state of the computing virtual machine are all represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The implementation of the concepts presented provides a practical computing paradigm that leverages the highly-distributed and standardized representational-layer of the Semantic Web.
2477	I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.
1910	The following question is addressed: under what conditions can a strange diffusive process, defined by a semi-dynamical V-Langevin equation or its associated Hybrid kinetic equation (HKE), be described by an equivalent purely stochastic process, defined by a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or by a Fractional Differential Equation (FDE)? More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived.
941	This research paper investigates the relationship between groups of diffeomorphisms and geometric loops of manifolds over ultra-normed fields. We explore the properties of these groups and their interactions with geometric loops, focusing on the topological and geometric structures that emerge. Our approach involves deriving new mathematical frameworks to analyze the properties of these groups and their associated geometric loops, as well as developing novel techniques for characterizing the behavior of these structures. Ultimately, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between groups of diffeomorphisms and geometric loops of manifolds over ultra-normed fields, and to identify potential applications of these structures in various fields of mathematics and physics.
2405	This research paper presents multi-wavelength observations of Southern Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs) using ammonia and 24 GHz continuum data, with a focus on the methanol masers that trace these HMCs. The study found that the ammonia emission is coincident with the methanol masers, indicating that ammonia can be used as a reliable tracer of HMCs. The continuum emission at 24 GHz was also detected in the HMCs, which suggests that the continuum emission can be used to identify HMCs in future surveys. Overall, this study provides important insights into the properties and characteristics of HMCs in the Southern hemisphere.
1755	"The research paper titled ""Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties"" investigates how social influence affects individuals' decision-making processes. The study proposes a mathematical model that incorporates the idea that people are influenced by the decisions of others in their social network. The authors show that under certain conditions, the model exhibits generic properties, such as a phase transition between a state of conformity and non-conformity. Additionally, they find that the degree of social influence is dependent on the size and structure of the social network. The study's findings suggest that social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual decision-making and provide insights into the factors that affect the spread of ideas and behaviors within a community."
2750	This research paper investigates the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIRB) in 40 new regions at 2.2 and 3.5 microns using data from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). By subtracting the 2MASS data from the DIRBE data, we confirm the presence of CIRB in these regions. Our findings suggest that the CIRB is a significant contributor to the overall infrared emission in these regions and highlights the importance of further studies to better understand its properties and origins.
3864	"While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass."
1353	We present the main results of the PhD Thesis carried out by L\'opez-S\'anchez (2006), in which a detailed morphological, photometrical and spectroscopical analysis of a sample of 20 Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies was realized. The main aims are the study of the star formation and O and WR stellar populations in these galaxies and the role that interactions between low surface companion objects have in the triggering of the bursts. We analyze the morphology, stellar populations, physical conditions, chemical abundances and kinematics of the ionized gas, as well as the star-formation activity of each system.
3246	This research paper presents a comprehensive quantum real-space simulation study of ballistic graphene nanoribbon MOSFETs. The simulation results reveal that the device performance is highly dependent on the width and edge configuration of the graphene nanoribbon. The study also highlights the potential of these devices for high-frequency applications due to their high carrier mobility. Additionally, the simulation results indicate the need for improved control over the doping level and edge roughness to optimize device performance. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of graphene nanoribbon MOSFETs for future electronic applications.
1294	This research paper investigates the stratified dust distribution of the GG Tau circumbinary ring. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), we analyze the ring's morphology and identify the presence of gaps and asymmetries. Our analysis reveals that the dust in the ring is stratified, with larger particles concentrated in the midplane and smaller particles distributed throughout the ring. We propose that this stratification is due to the gravitational influence of the binary stars on the dust particles. Our findings shed new light on the complex dynamics of circumbinary disks and have important implications for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
1872	We propose a method to study the integrable cellular automata with periodic boundary conditions, via the tropical spectral curve and its Jacobian. We introduce the tropical version of eigenvector map from the isolevel set to a divisor class on the tropical hyperelliptic curve. We also provide some conjectures related to the divisor class and the Jacobian. Finally, we apply our method to the periodic box and ball system and clarify the algebro-geometrical meaning of the real torus introduced for its initial value problem.
2517	This research paper presents a novel approach to network coding using a Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DDGA). Network coding is a technique that enables efficient data transmission over networks by allowing intermediate nodes to combine and transform data packets. However, traditional approaches to network coding can be computationally expensive and difficult to optimize. The proposed DDGA approach addresses these challenges by using a genetic algorithm that incorporates both population and individual level distributions. This allows for a more efficient and effective search for optimal network coding solutions. Simulation results show that the DDGA approach outperforms traditional genetic algorithms and other state-of-the-art network coding techniques in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of network coding in a variety of applications.
3577	This research paper examines the optical variability of infrared power law-selected galaxies and X-ray sources in the GOODS-South Field. Using multi-epoch imaging data, we identify sources that show significant variability and study their properties. Our analysis reveals a diverse population of objects, including active galactic nuclei, star-forming galaxies, and transients. We find that optical variability is a useful tool for identifying and characterizing sources in the infrared and X-ray regimes. These results have important implications for our understanding of the physics of high-energy astrophysical sources and their evolution over time.
3315	We report on calculations of broadening effects in QCL due to alloy scattering. The output of numerical calculations of alloy broadened Landau levels compare favorably with calculations performed at the self-consistent Born approximation. Results for Landau level width and optical absorption are presented. A disorder activated forbidden transition becomes significant in the vicinity of crossings of Landau levels which belong to different subbands. A study of the time dependent survival probability in the lowest Landau level of the excited subband is performed. It is shown that at resonance the population relaxation occurs in a subpicosecond scale.
3470	We propose a novel experiment to identify the symmetry of superconductivity on the basis of theoretical results for differential conductance of a normal metal connected to a superconductor. The proximity effect from the superconductor modifies the conductance of the remote current depending remarkably on the pairing symmetry: spin-singlet or spin-triplet. The clear-cut difference in the conductance is explained by symmetry of Cooper pairs in a normal metal with respect to frequency. In the spin-triplet case, the anomalous transport is realized due to an odd-frequency symmetry of Cooper pairs.
D2-96	Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[19] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[20][21] Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years until disappearing in the late 15th century. The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
2823	This research paper presents a study of the proper motion of L and T dwarf stars within the Pleiades star cluster. By using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the authors identified 21 L and T dwarf candidates as potential members of the Pleiades. Through further analysis of their proper motions and comparison with known members of the cluster, they confirmed 10 of these candidates as likely members. This study expands our understanding of the population of low-mass stars within the Pleiades and highlights the potential of using proper motion as a tool for identifying new cluster members.
1107	The CALICE collaboration is presently constructing a test hadron calorimeter (HCAL) with 7620 scintillator tiles read out by novel photo-detectors - Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). This prototype is the first device which uses SiPMs on a large scale. We present the design of the HCAL and report on measured properties of more than 10 thousand SiPMs. We discuss the SiPM efficiency, gain, cross-talk, and noise rate dependence on bias voltage and temperature, including the spread in these parameters. We analyze the reasons for SiPM rejection and present the results of the long term stability studies. The first measurements of the SiPM radiation hardness are presented. We compare properties of SiPM with the properties of similar devices, MRS APD and MPPC. A possibility to make the tiles thinner and to read them out without WLS fibers has been studied.

The study focuses on identifying the most efficient energy solutions that can be employed to enhance the stability and performance of polymer aqueous solutions in 2D systems. The research utilizes experimental and theoretical methods to evaluate the performance of various energy solutions. The critical outcomes of this study indicate that the use of external energy sources, such as ultrasound and electric fields, can significantly improve the stability and performance of polymer aqueous solutions in 2D systems. The research concludes that the proposed energy solutions hold great potential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of polymer-based technologies and applications.
1285	The diagram algebra introduced by Brauer that describes the centralizer algebra on tensor products of the natural representation of an orthogonal group has a presentation by generators and relations that only depends on the graph of type An on n nodes. Here we describe an algebra depending on an arbitrary graph of type M. We study its structure when the type is An, Dn, E6, E7, E8. We determine the representations and find the dimensions. The algebra is generically semisimple and contains the group algebra of the Coxeter type M as a subalgebra. It is a ring homomorphism of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of these types. This fact will be used in later work determining the structure of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras of simply laced spherical type.
316	We discuss a mechanism which generates a mass term for a scalar field in an expanding universe. The mass of this field turns out to be generated by the cosmological constant and can be naturally small if protected by a conformal symmetry which is however broken in the gravitational sector. The mass is comparable today to the Hubble time. This scalar field could thus impact our universe today and for example be at the origin of a time variation of the couplings and masses of the parameters of the standard model.
1279	The random initialization of weights of a multilayer perceptron makes it possible to model its training process as a Las Vegas algorithm, i.e. a randomized algorithm which stops when some required training error is obtained, and whose execution time is a random variable. This modeling is used to perform a case study on a well-known pattern recognition benchmark: the UCI Thyroid Disease Database. Empirical evidence is presented of the training time probability distribution exhibiting a heavy tail behavior, meaning a big probability mass of long executions. This fact is exploited to reduce the training time cost by applying two simple restart strategies. The first assumes full knowledge of the distribution yielding a 40% cut down in expected time with respect to the training without restarts. The second, assumes null knowledge, yielding a reduction ranging from 9% to 23%.
1984	This research paper investigates atom-wave diffraction in the Raman-Nath and Bragg regime, focusing on the effective Rabi frequency, losses, and phase shifts. The study shows that the diffraction pattern is highly dependent on the regime and the atom-light interaction parameters. It was found that losses due to spontaneous emission and decoherence effects play a significant role in the diffraction process. Furthermore, the phase shifts were observed to be influenced by the interplay between the diffraction regime and the atom-light interaction parameters. The study concludes that a comprehensive understanding of the atom-wave diffraction process is essential for the design and implementation of atom interferometers and other quantum technologies.
792	This research paper explores the E_6/U(1)_N model and its implications for neutrino mass and dark matter. The authors use a two-loop calculation to determine the neutrino mass, finding that it is sensitive to the choice of parameters in the model. They also investigate the possibility of dark matter particles in the model, considering both a scalar and a fermionic candidate. The authors find that the scalar candidate is ruled out by current experimental limits, but the fermionic candidate remains a viable option. Overall, this research highlights the potential of the E_6/U(1)_N model in explaining both neutrino mass and dark matter, and provides insights into the properties of such particles.
1009	"The research paper titled ""On the generalized Freedman-Townsend model"" discusses a new approach for modeling the dynamics of a population. The authors introduce a generalized version of the Freedman-Townsend model, which includes additional parameters to account for different aspects of the population dynamics. The paper presents theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the model, demonstrating its ability to capture complex dynamics such as oscillations, chaos, and extinction. The key findings of the paper suggest that the generalized model is more flexible and accurate than the original Freedman-Townsend model, providing a useful tool for studying population dynamics in various fields such as ecology, epidemiology, and economics."
2577	In the past decade high resolution measurements in the infrared employing adaptive optics imaging on 10m telescopes have allowed determining the three dimensional orbits stars within ten light hours of the compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way. These observations show the presence of a three million solar mass black hole in Sagittarius A* beyond any reasonable doubt. The Galactic Center thus constitutes the best astrophysical evidence for the existence of black holes which have long been postulated, and is also an ideal `lab' for studying the physics in the vicinity of such an object. Remarkably, young massive stars are present there and probably have formed in the innermost stellar cusp. Variable infrared and X-ray emission from Sagittarius A* are a new probe of the physical processes and space-time curvature just outside the event horizon.

2693	This research paper investigates the failure of subadditivity of the Wigner-Yanase entropy, which is a measure of quantum uncertainty. The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the entropy and demonstrates that it violates the subadditivity property in certain situations. This finding has significant implications for the use of the Wigner-Yanase entropy as a tool for characterizing quantum systems. The paper concludes that the failure of subadditivity of the entropy should be taken into account when interpreting experimental results and designing new quantum technologies. Overall, this research highlights the importance of carefully examining the properties of quantum entropy measures, and provides valuable insights for the development of future quantum technologies.

The study investigates the impact of spin-orbit interaction on transport properties in chaotic cavities, which are known for their complex dynamics and are of great interest in the field of nanoelectronics. The results indicate that spin-orbit interaction can significantly modify the transport properties, leading to new phenomena such as weak localization and spin Hall effect. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the spin transport properties in chaotic systems, which has potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Overall, the research contributes to the understanding of the fundamental physics of spin transport in nanoscale systems and has implications for the development of novel devices based on spintronics.
1624	A long duration photon beam can induce macroscopic coherent effects on a plasma by single photon electron scattering if the probability of the interaction approaches 1 in a volume of unit surface and length equal to the plasma typical wavelength, and the induced electron oscillations become relativistic in few plasma cycles. A fraction of the plasma electrons is accelerated through the Wakefield mechanism by the cavities created by the photon-electron interactions and radiates through boosted betraton emission in the same cavities. The resulting emission in this framework is very similar to the typical GRB radiation. Several comparisons with GRB light curves and spectral-energy correlations will be presented.
3415	We study elementary low energy excitations inside a supersolid. We find that the coupling between the longitudinal lattice vibration mode and the superfluid mode leads to two longitudinal modes (one upper branch and one lower branch) inside the supersolid, while the transverse modes in the supersolid stay the same as those inside a normal solid. We also work out various experimental signatures of these novel elementary excitations by evaluating the Debye-Waller factor, density-density correlation, vortex loop-vertex loop interactions, specific heat and excess entropy from the vacancies per mole.
2684	We consider the regions of the MSSM parameter space where the top squarks become light and even may be the LSP. This happens when the triple scalar coupling A becomes very big compared to m_0. We show that in this case the requirement that the LSP is neutral imposes noticeable constraint on the parameter space excluding low m_0 and m_{1/2} similar to constraint from the Higgs mass limit. In some cases these constraints overlap. This picture takes place in a wide region of \tan\beta. In a narrow band close to the border line the stops are long-lived particles and decay into quarks and neutralino (chargino). The cross-section of their production at LHC via gluon fusion mechanism in this region may reach a few pb.
15	This research paper focuses on the modeling of torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction. The main objective is to understand the behavior of these wires under torsion stress and to predict the corresponding magnetoimpedance response. The study combines experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to determine the magnetoimpedance response under different torsion stress conditions. The findings show that the torsion stress has a significant impact on the magnetoimpedance response, and the negative magnetostriction enhances the effect. The research concludes that the proposed modeling approach can be used to optimize the design of magnetoimpedance sensors for various applications.
124	This research paper investigates the use of a vibrating RF SQUID as a means of displacement detection. By leveraging the unique properties of the SQUID, which is capable of detecting minute changes in magnetic fields, we demonstrate the ability to beat the standard linear limit of displacement detection. Our experimental results show that the vibrating RF SQUID is capable of detecting sub-nanometer displacements, far beyond the capabilities of conventional displacement sensors. Additionally, we discuss the potential applications of this technology in fields such as nanotechnology, biomedicine, and precision manufacturing. Overall, our findings suggest that the vibrating RF SQUID represents a promising avenue for improving the accuracy and sensitivity of displacement detection.

The findings of this study have significant implications for risk management in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
327	We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this test are presented.

Isotropic sets of points refer to a collection of points that exhibit symmetry and uniformity in all directions. The paper investigates the properties and characteristics of isotropic sets and proposes their use in designing robot architectures that can move and operate efficiently in any direction.

300	We investigate the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a circular waveguide with conducting walls filled by homogeneous dielectric. The parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both TE and TM waves. It is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the TE waves. Various limiting cases are considered. The results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium.
2629	"Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk. We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of the ""Central Limit Theorem"" useful to study large portfolio losses. Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis."
D1-23	Recent findings on the ecology, etiology and pathology of coral pathogens, host resistance mechanisms, previously unknown disease/syndromes and the global nature of coral reef diseases have increased our concern about the health and future of coral reef communities. Much of what has been discovered in the past 4 years is presented in this special issue. Among the significant findings, the role that various Vibrio species play in coral disease and health, the composition of the ‘normal microbiota’ of corals, and the possible role of viruses in the disease process are important additions to our knowledge.  reefs and a major cause of reef deterioration.
841	In this research paper, we investigate the coupling of transverse and longitudinal responses in stiff polymers using molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that this coupling is strongly influenced by the polymer's stiffness and can result in significant changes in the polymer's mechanical properties. Specifically, we show that the coupling between transverse and longitudinal responses can result in increased stiffness and strength in the polymer, which has important implications for the design of high-performance materials. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering the coupling of different response modes in the mechanical behavior of stiff polymers.
1508	We study atom scattering from two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates using a position sensitive, time resolved, single atom detector. In analogy to quantum optics, the process can also be thought of as spontaneous, degenerate four wave mixing of de Broglie waves. We find a clear correlation between atoms with opposite momenta, demonstrating pair production in the scattering process. We also observe a Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation for collinear momenta, which permits an independent measurement of the size of the pair production source and thus the size of the spatial mode. The back to back pairs occupy very nearly two oppositely directed spatial modes, a promising feature for future quantum optics experiments.
2656	The Friedel oscillations resulting from coupling a quantum dot to one edge of a disordered one-dimensional wire in the Mott insulator regime, are calculated numerically using the DMRG method. By investigating the influence of the disorder on the Friedel oscillations decay we find that the effect of disorder is reduced by increasing the interaction strength. This behavior is opposite to the recently reported influence of disorder in the Anderson insulator regime, where disorder led to a stronger decay of the Friedel oscillations.
1081	We report on the fabrication and transport studies of a single-layer graphene p-n junction. Carrier type and density in two adjacent regions are individually controlled by electrostatic gating using a local top gate and a global back gate. A functionalized Al203 oxide that adheres to graphene and does not significantly affect its electronic properties is described. Measurements in the quantum Hall regime reveal new plateaus of two-terminal conductance across the junction at 1 and 3/2 times the quantum of conductance, e2/h, consistent with theory.
2638	This research paper focuses on the development of fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems. The paper proposes a new approach for designing digital filters that can accurately model nonlinear systems, even under challenging conditions such as high-order dynamics and non-Gaussian noise. The filters are shown to be computationally efficient and robust, with promising results demonstrated through simulations of several nonlinear systems. The study concludes that the proposed filters offer a practical and effective solution for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems.
2648	In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued k-variate function h calculated at all possible sets of k points from a random sample. In the present paper we investigate the corresponding extreme value analogue, which we shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample. U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric invariants.
D1-11	"The basic idea of biological evolution is that populations and species of organisms change over time. Today, when we think of evolution, we are likely to link this idea with one specific person: the British naturalist Charles Darwin. In the 1850s, Darwin wrote an influential and controversial book called On the Origin of Species. In it, he proposed that species evolve (or, as he put it, undergo ""descent with modification""), and that all living things can trace their descent to a common ancestor. Darwin also suggested a mechanism for evolution: natural selection, in which heritable traits that help organisms survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time."
3487	This research paper investigates the behavior of gluons in a two-dimensional quantum well of color ferromagnetic quark matter. The study uses lattice QCD simulations to analyze the gluon condensates and the spectrum of excitations. The results suggest that the gluon condensates are enhanced in the presence of color ferromagnetic quark matter, and the spectrum of excitations shows a gap. These findings provide insights into the strong interaction dynamics of quark-gluon plasma and may have implications for the study of high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
4044	This research paper provides an update on the progress made in the scalar potential model, which is a theoretical framework used to explain the origin and properties of scalar fields. The main focus of the paper is on recent advancements in understanding the behavior of scalar fields in different physical contexts, such as cosmology and particle physics. The paper highlights crucial findings, including the discovery of new scalar particles and the development of new techniques for calculating scalar field interactions. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research in the field.
3807	We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).
2533	In this paper we study one dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with random terminal time not necessarily bounded or finite when the generator F(t,Y,Z) has a quadratic growth in Z. We provide existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution of such BSDEs and, in the case of infinite horizon, regular dependence on parameters. The obtained results are then applied to prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to elliptic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces.

D2-43	Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor.

In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from.
2651	This research paper explores the Mpemba effect and phase transitions in the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing. The Mpemba effect is a phenomenon where hot water freezes faster than cold water under certain conditions.

Radon, a radioactive gas found in certain soil types, is another major contributor. It can accumulate in homes and buildings, posing a long-term health risk if exposure levels are high. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, such as emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, as well as cooking fumes from coal or wood.
2340	This research paper explores the concept of stringy universes and proposes a wave-function to describe their behavior. The study draws upon the principles of string theory, quantum mechanics, and cosmology to develop a mathematical framework that can predict the properties of these universes.

These results provide important insights into the behavior of supercurrent in diffusive Josephson junctions and have implications for the design and optimization of such devices for practical applications.
274	We use continuum theory to show that chirality is a key thermodynamic control parameter for the aggregation of biopolymers: chirality produces a stable disperse phase of hexagonal bundles under moderately poor solvent conditions, as has been observed in {\it in-vitro} studies of F-actin [O. Pelletier {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 148102 (2003)]. The large characteristic radius of these chiral bundles is not determined by a mysterious long-range molecular interaction but by in-plane shear elastic stresses generated by the interplay between a chiral torque and an unusual, but universal, non-linear gauge term in the strain tensor of ordered chains that is imposed by rotational invariance.
3476	We present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of single-layer graphene crystals examined under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The samples, with lateral dimensions on the micron scale, were prepared on a silicon dioxide surface by direct exfoliation of single crystal graphite. The single-layer films were identified using Raman spectroscopy. Topographic images of single-layer samples display the honeycomb structure expected for the full hexagonal symmetry of an isolated graphene monolayer. The absence of observable defects in the STM images is indicative of the high quality of these films. Crystals comprised of a few layers of graphene were also examined. They exhibited dramatically different STM topography, displaying the reduced three-fold symmetry characteristic of the surface of bulk graphite.

The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between fundamental physics and cosmology in resolving some of the most challenging problems in modern science.
2282	The mechanism of the shift, broadening and quenching of the ammonia inversion frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of the wavefunction.

The conclusions of the research provide insights into the physical mechanisms that govern the bursting dynamics in cylindrical domains and their implications for various applications in fluid mechanics.
D1-15	General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics.

1204	Using a general Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian, we study the topological structure and low-lying collective modes of dense QCD having both chiral and diquark condensates, for two and three massless flavors. As we found earlier, the QCD axial anomaly acts as an external field applied to the chiral condensate in a color superconductor and, as a new critical point emerges, leads to a crossover between the broken chiral symmetry and color superconducting phases. At intermediate densities where both chiral and diquark condensates are present, we derive a generalized Gell-Mann- Oakes-Renner relation between the masses of pseudoscalar bosons and the magnitude of the chiral and diquark-condensates. We show explicitly the continuity of the ordinary pion at low densities to a generalized pion at high densities.

The conclusions of the study indicate that buffer gas-thermalized anions can be efficiently evaporated out of a multipole rf ion trap, and the process can be optimized by adjusting certain parameters.
3178	Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most 1.

The paper demonstrates that D-branes can indeed be used to construct a bubbling Calabi-Yau manifold, and discusses the implications of this result for further research in string theory. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe.
976	The charge transport mechanism and the macroscopic dielectric constant in polycrystalline device materials commonly exhibit several components such as electrode-sample interface, grain boundary and bulk contributions. In order to gain precise understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic device materials it is essential to deconvolute these contributions. The paradigm of functional thermistor ceramics based on thick film spinel manganates has been studied by temperature dependent alternating current impedance spectroscopy. Three typical relaxation phenomena were detected, which all showed a separated temperature dependence of resistivity consistent with thermally activated charge transport. The dominating grain boundary and the interface contributions exhibited distinctively different capacitance allowing clear identification. The composite nature of the dielectric properties in polycrystalline functional ceramics was emphasized, and impedance spectroscopy was shown to be a powerful tool to account for and model such behaviour.

366	In magnetic systems with dominating easy-plane anisotropy the magnetization can be described by an effective one dimensional equation for the in-plane angle. Re-deriving this equation in the presence of spin-transfer torques, we obtain a description that allows for a more intuitive understanding of spintronic devices' operation and can serve as a tool for finding new dynamic regimes. A surprising prediction is obtained for a planar ``spin-flip transistor'': an unstable equilibrium point can be stabilized by a current induced torque that further repels the system from that point. Stabilization by repulsion happens due to the presence of dissipative environment and requires a Gilbert damping constant that is large enough to ensure overdamped dynamics at zero current.

Our approach involves a combination of theoretical results and computational techniques, and we present a number of concrete examples to illustrate our findings. Our main contribution is a deeper understanding of the connections between ample subvarieties and rationally connected fibrations, which has important implications for the study of algebraic varieties and their geometry.
3652	The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a powerful telescope capable of observing the solar chromosphere in unprecedented detail. In this research paper, we argue that ALMA is the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity, and ability to observe at multiple wavelengths. We review recent observations of the chromosphere using ALMA and discuss how these observations have improved our understanding of the dynamics and structure of this region of the solar atmosphere. We also discuss future directions for ALMA observations of the chromosphere and their potential impact on our understanding of solar physics. Overall, we conclude that ALMA is an essential tool for studying the chromosphere and will continue to provide valuable insights into this important region of the Sun.
2236	We consider decay of phonon condensate into phonons at photodissociation of the strong coupling large polaron (SCLP), when the charge carrier becomes free. Expression to calculate the band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of SCLP is obtained. The band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of strong-coupling large-radius polarons is a broad band with the shape determined by Poisson distribution. It can be structured or unstructured depending on the phonon dispersion since a distance between neighbouring lines comprising the band is the phonon energy. Half-width of the band is in the interval 1.3 - 1.7Ep, depending on the phonon energy. The band maximum is situated approximately at the electron energy Ephot-W-3.2Ep (where Ephot is the photon energy, W is work function), and its position does not depend on the electron wave vector direction.
997	"The research paper titled ""Large deviation generating function for energy transport in the Pauli-Fierz model"" focuses on studying the energy transport in a system of interacting particles known as the Pauli-Fierz model. The authors use mathematical techniques to derive a large deviation generating function that describes the probability of observing a particular energy transport in the system. They also investigate the behavior of the generating function in different limits and identify the dominant energy transport mechanisms. The main conclusion of the study is that the behavior of the generating function is consistent with the existence of two distinct energy transport mechanisms, one that is diffusive and another that is ballistic. These findings provide insights into the fundamental properties of energy transport in interacting particle systems, which have important implications for various fields of physics and engineering."
3859	This research paper explores the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, with a focus on the case of weighted projective spaces. Abelian symplectic reductions are a powerful tool in algebraic geometry for studying symplectic quotients. The orbifold cohomology of these reductions is a topological invariant that captures the underlying geometric structure of the quotient space. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, and derive explicit formulas for the case of weighted projective spaces. Our results shed new light on the interplay between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry, and have potential applications in a wide range of fields, including mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology.
1283	A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images was developed in the framework of the MAGIC-5 Italian project. One of the main goals of this project is to build a distributed database of lung CT scans in order to enable automated image analysis through a data and cpu GRID infrastructure. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system, a dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier for false-positive finding reduction, are described. The system was designed and tested for both internal and sub-pleural nodules. The results obtained on the collected database of low-dose thin-slice CT scans are shown in terms of free response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves and discussed.
1648	The research paper investigates the single photoeffect on helium-like ions in the non-relativistic region. The study employs a theoretical approach based on the Dirac-Fock method and uses a detailed numerical analysis to investigate the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions. The study shows that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions are highly sensitive to the nuclear charge and electron correlation. The findings indicate that the photoionization cross section of helium-like ions increases with increasing nuclear charge, while it decreases with increasing electron correlation. The study concludes that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions can provide valuable insights into the atomic structure and dynamics of heavy ions.
21	The research paper explores the behavior of trapped Bose-Einstein condensed gases in the presence of weak disorder. The study focuses on the collective oscillations of the system, which are influenced by the interaction between the particles and the disorder potential. The authors investigate the impact of disorder strength and density on the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the system. The results show that the presence of weak disorder can significantly alter the collective oscillations of the system, with the damping rate increasing as the disorder strength and density increase. The study concludes that the understanding of collective oscillations in disordered Bose-Einstein condensed gases is important for the development of future applications in areas such as quantum computing and precision metrology.
767	Resent works of Hawking and Susskind suggested that information is conserved in the universe. We extend this thesis and propose that dynamics of information - computations can conserve in Anti-de-Sitter cosmological model. Information geometry formalism is proposed to analyze information in dynamical systems. We consider entropy flow as a geometrical flow on statistical manifold and develop a Dynamic Cores model to analyze migration of information in dynamical systems. Geometrical flow on the statistical manifold was considered as a transition of local dynamical systems in original d+1-dim AdS space to their delocalized holographic representation in d-dim Conformal Field Theory (CFT). It was noted that geometrical flow related to renormalization group flow and provide semi-conservation of informational invariants. Those invariants interpreted as types of computations.
3570	Presented in this paper is the kinematic analysis of a symmetrical three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator. In opposite to serial manipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This property produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility in trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of aspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on the notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse kinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular assembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel manipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle.
18	We experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in superconducting phase qubits driven by microwave pulses. In a wide range of temperatures, we find that both the decay time and the amplitude of these coherent oscillations remain nearly unaffected by thermal fluctuations. The oscillations are observed well above the crossover temperature from thermally activated escape to quantum tunneling for undriven qubits. In the two-level limit, coherent qubit response rapidly vanishes as soon as the energy of thermal fluctuations kT becomes larger than the energy level spacing of the qubit. Our observations shed new light on the origin of decoherence in superconducting qubits. The experimental data suggest that, without degrading already achieved coherence times, phase qubits can be operated at temperatures much higher than those reported till now.
3497	This research paper explores the coherent dynamics of photoinduced nucleation processes in a wide range of materials. The primary focus is on understanding the nucleation process and the role of coherence in it. The study employs a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches to analyze the dynamics of nucleation. The findings suggest that coherence plays a crucial role in the nucleation process and affects the nucleation rate and size distribution of the nuclei. The study concludes that a better understanding of the coherence effects in nucleation can lead to the optimization of materials for various applications.
1346	The study focuses on analyzing the ultraviolet spectra of ten dwarf novae in outburst using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite. The researchers aimed to investigate the physical properties of the accretion disks and white dwarf stars that are responsible for the outbursts. They discovered that the spectra of the dwarf novae showed evidence of emission from accretion disks, white dwarfs, and hot gas. The study also revealed that the outbursts of dwarf novae are caused by the instabilities in the accretion disks. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the physics of accretion disks and help to better understand the behavior of dwarf novae.
2613	This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.
416	This research paper investigates crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property. The Rokhlin property, a crucial concept in the theory of operator algebras, characterizes the existence of a certain type of projection in a crossed product. We analyze the conditions under which this property holds and provide examples of group actions that satisfy it. Our study yields significant consequences for the classification of operator algebras and the construction of non-commutative dynamical systems. In particular, we demonstrate that the Rokhlin property enables the decomposition of crossed products into simpler algebras, which facilitates their analysis and classification. Our findings contribute to the development of a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of operator algebras and have implications for various areas of mathematics and physics.
2265	This research paper investigates the classical information capacity of the bosonic broadcast channel, which is used for communication in quantum information theory. The channel's capacity is analyzed, and the researchers establish an upper bound on the capacity using a new coding scheme. The study demonstrates that the bosonic broadcast channel's classical information capacity can be significantly increased by using a coherent-state encoding scheme. The results of this study are significant for the development of quantum communication protocols and could pave the way for more efficient and secure communication systems in the future.
2351	The paper focuses on analyzing the game-theoretic power control mechanism in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless networks with rake receivers. The authors use a large system analysis approach to investigate the behavior and performance of the power control game in such networks. They propose a new algorithm for power control that takes into account the interference caused by multiple access points in the network. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network's throughput and reduce interference compared to other existing algorithms. The authors conclude that game-theoretic power control can be an effective solution for managing interference in UWB wireless networks with rake receivers.
969	"The research paper titled ""Random walks of Wilson loops in the screening regime"" explores the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime using random walk models. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the dynamics of Wilson loops in the presence of heavy screening. The researchers found that the screening effect leads to a decrease in the typical size of the Wilson loops. They also observed that the distribution of Wilson loops becomes more Gaussian as the screening becomes stronger. The study concludes that random walk models can be used to understand the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime."
3162	We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system (atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.
699	We give a one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) capable of simulating all others. By this we mean that the initial configuration and the local transition rule of any one-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the initial configuration of the universal QCA. Several steps of the universal QCA will then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA. The simulation preserves the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. The encoding is linear and hence does not carry any of the cost of the computation. We do this in two flavours: a weak one which requires an infinite but periodic initial configuration and a strong one which needs only a finite initial configuration. KEYWORDS: Quantum cellular automata, Intrinsic universality, Quantum computation.
1752	We investigate the behavior of the directed current in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions driven by local periodic potentials in the forward as well in backscattering channels. We treat the problem with Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We present the exact solution for the case of an infinite wire and show that in this case the dc current vanishes identically. We also investigate a confined system consistent in an annular arrangement coupled to a particle reservoir. We present a perturbative treatment that allows for the analytical expressions of the dc current in the lowest order of the amplitudes of the potential. We also present results obtained from the exact numerical solution of the problem.
3500	We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed.
236	This research paper explores the interplay between universities and industries through the FP5 network. The FP5 network, which was established by the European Union, aimed to promote collaboration and knowledge exchange between universities and industries. The study investigates the effectiveness of this network in fostering partnerships, developing joint projects, and enhancing technology transfer. The research employs a qualitative approach through a case study analysis of selected academic and industry collaborations within the FP5 network. The findings of this study provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of university-industry collaboration and shed light on the potential of the FP5 network to facilitate such collaborations.
382	We have analyzed a large sample of numerically simulated clusters to demonstrate the adverse effects resulting from use of X-ray fitted beta-model parameters with Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) data. There is a fundamental incompatibility between model fits to X-ray surface brightness profiles and those done with SZE profiles. Since observational SZE radial profiles are in short supply, the X-ray parameters are often used in SZE analysis. We show that this leads to biased estimates of the integrated Compton y-parameter inside r_{500} calculated from clusters. We suggest a simple correction of the method, using a non-isothermal beta-model modified by a universal temperature profile, which brings these calculated quantities into closer agreement with the true values.
D2-33	Computational systems biology is an emerging field in biological simulation that attempts to model or simulate intra- and intercellular events using data gathered from genomic, proteomic or metabolomic experiments. The need to model complex temporal and spatiotemporal processes at many different scales has led to the emergence of numerous techniques, including systems of differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata simulators, agent-based models and pi calculus. This review provides a brief summary and an assessment of most of these approaches. It also provides examples of how these methods are being used to facilitate drug discovery and development. Systems biology is a newly emerging, multi-disciplinary field that studies the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes by treating these processes as integrated systems.
3261	This research study investigates the phenomenon of stochastic resonance with weak monochromatic driving and its ability to achieve gains above unity through high-frequency signals. The paper presents a theoretical framework for this phenomenon and analyzes the conditions under which it can occur. Results indicate that stochastic resonance with weak monochromatic driving can indeed achieve gains above unity through high-frequency signals, and that this effect is strongest when the system is near a bifurcation point. These findings have important implications for a wide range of applications, including signal processing, communication systems, and neural networks. Overall, this research paper concludes that stochastic resonance with weak monochromatic driving is a powerful and versatile mechanism that can be harnessed to enhance the performance of many different systems.
2446	New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies. Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.
3982	We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a length-independent value in the presence of radiation.
3	The paper presents an efficient centralized binary multicast network coding algorithm for any cyclic network. The proposed algorithm aims to optimize network performance by minimizing the number of transmissions required for multicast messages to reach their intended destinations in a cyclic network. The algorithm employs network coding techniques that combine multiple packets into a single transmission, thereby reducing network congestion and improving bandwidth utilization. The proposed algorithm is designed to operate in a centralized manner, which enables network administrators to efficiently manage network resources. The algorithm is evaluated through simulations, and the results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solutions. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of the proposed algorithm for improving the efficiency and reliability of multicast communications in cyclic networks.
633	This research paper investigates the screening masses in the SU(3) pure gauge theory and explores their potential relationship with universality. The study utilizes lattice simulations to calculate the screening masses, which are a fundamental property of the theory that describes the behavior of quark-antiquark pairs at large distances. The results demonstrate that the screening masses exhibit a universal scaling behavior, indicating a possible connection to universality. Additionally, the study examines the impact of different lattice sizes and couplings on the screening masses, providing insights into the theory's behavior under various conditions. The findings shed light on the fundamental properties of the SU(3) pure gauge theory and may have implications for our understanding of universality in gauge theories.
2846	This research paper investigates the linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane. The Cremona group, which consists of birational transformations of the projective plane, is a fundamental object in algebraic geometry. In particular, we focus on the linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group, which has important implications for the study of algebraic surfaces and their automorphisms. We provide a comprehensive study of the linearisation of these subgroups and establish new results regarding their structure and properties. Our research has important applications in algebraic geometry, particularly in the study of algebraic surfaces, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the Cremona group and its subgroups.
D2-90	The principle of positron emission tomography (PET) is that radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical injected intravenously into a patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations. This is a technology that is extremely useful in the detection and treatment of diseases like cancer. However, there is some confusion about how PET works. Before PET was introduced a different type of radiation imaging called SPECT (single-photon emission computerised tomography) was used. This technology was based on the pinhole camera technique whereby a reverse image of an object is obtained by passing the light through a small aperture or pinhole.

The study also reveals a link between the tropicalization of algebraic curves and integrability of cellular automata, which sheds light on the deep connections between algebraic geometry and integrable systems. Overall, this research paper provides an insightful understanding of the relationship between tropical spectral curves and integrable cellular automata, which has significant implications for both mathematics and physics.

3779	We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement between spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can be qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model.
1552	The alpha helix-coil phase transition is a fundamental phenomenon in protein folding and stability. In this paper, we present an analysis of ab initio theory predictions for this transition. Our study reveals that the ab initio method accurately predicts the structural changes during the transition, and provides insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the process. We also highlight the importance of the hydrogen bonding network in stabilizing the alpha helix structure. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of protein folding and have potential implications for drug design and protein engineering.
864	Making use of recent techniques in the theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators, we characterize the class of point interaction Hamiltonians in a 3-D bounded domain with regular boundary. In the particular case of one point interaction acting in the center of a ball, we obtain an explicit representation of the point spectrum of the operator togheter with the corresponding related eigenfunctions. These operators are used to build up a model-system where the dynamics of a quantum particle depends on the state of a quantum bit.
1748	A consistent device model to describe current-voltage characteristics of metal/insulator/metal systems is developed. In this model the insulator and the metal electrodes are described within the same theoretical framework by using density of states distributions. This approach leads to differential equations for the electric field which have to be solved in a self consistent manner by considering the continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical potential in the complete system. The model is capable of describing the current-voltage characteristics of the metal/insulator/metal system in forward and reverse bias for arbitrary values of the metal/ insulator injection barriers. In the case of high injection barriers, approximations are provided offering a tool for comparison with experiments. Numerical calculations are performed exemplary using a simplified model of an organic semiconductor.
3116	This research paper investigates the hidden role of catalyst support in the growth of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) forests. The authors demonstrate that the type and thickness of the catalyst support strongly influence the growth behavior and resulting properties of the SWNTs. Specifically, a thin layer of alumina support leads to the growth of highly aligned SWNT forests with exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings for the design and optimization of SWNT-based devices and applications. Overall, the study sheds light on the complex interplay between catalyst support, growth conditions, and resulting SWNT properties, and provides important insights into the fundamental science of SWNT synthesis and growth.

The main objective of the study is to understand the nature and properties of these nebulae and their relationship with the pulsar. The researchers used multi-wavelength observations from several telescopes to analyze the emission properties of the nebulae and their spatial distribution. The study revealed that the radio and X-ray nebulae have different morphologies and are likely to be produced by different emission mechanisms. The researchers also found evidence of a compact X-ray source near the pulsar, which suggests the presence of a neutron star or a black hole companion. The study provides important insights into the physics of pulsar wind nebulae and their association with pulsars.
199	The Abbott-Deser mass, the Hamiltonian and the Komar mass of the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed horizons take different values. Introducing a new couple of thermodynamic variables for the Komar mass, we show that each mass can be interpreted as a thermodynamic potential with its own natural variables, i.e. all masses are related to each other by the Legendre transformations. It is found that the new variables and the gravitational tension represent the squashing of the outer horizon.
3041	Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems, called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium. In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type of objects will be presented.

3328	The method of optimized perturbation theory (OPT) is used to study the phase diagram of the massless Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. In the temperature and chemical potential plane, our results give strong support to the existence of a tricritical point and line of first order phase transition, previously only suspected to exist from extensive lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In addition of presenting these results we discuss how the OPT can be implemented in conjunction with the Landau expansion in order to determine all the relevant critical quantities.
3885	We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.

3485	"The research paper titled ""Preferential Detachment in Broadcast Signaling Networks: Connectivity and Cost Trade-off"" investigates how the preferential attachment mechanism affects the connectivity and cost of broadcast signaling networks. The study uses simulations to model the network growth process and evaluate its impact on network structure. The main finding of the study is that preferential attachment can lead to high connectivity but also increases the cost of maintaining the network.

1151	"The research paper titled ""Dual nature of improper ferroelectricity in a magnetoelectric multiferroic"" investigates the behavior of a material called BiFeO3, which exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic properties. The main focus of the study is to understand the relationship between these two properties and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications. The researchers found that the ferroelectric behavior in BiFeO3 is not purely intrinsic, but rather a result of a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. They also discovered that the magnetic behavior of the material can be controlled by an external electric field, opening up possibilities for new types of devices that combine magnetic and electric properties. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex behavior of multiferroic materials and their potential for technological applications."
1786	In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm) showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation, whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.
1753	This research paper investigates the quantum pump effect in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions. The quantum pump effect is a phenomenon that occurs in systems with time-dependent potentials, where a net charge current is generated without the application of an external bias voltage. The authors use a tight-binding model to study the pump effect in a one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon, finding that the pump effect is robust against disorder and can be tuned by adjusting the system parameters. They also show that the pump effect is sensitive to the Fermi energy and the frequency of the driving potential. The paper concludes that the one-dimensional Dirac fermion system is a promising platform for studying the quantum pump effect and its potential applications in nanoelectronics.
3443	Since S-parameter measurements without uncertainty cannot claim any credibility, the uncertainties in full two-port Vector Network Analyser (VNA) measurements were estimated using total complex differentials (Total Differential Errors). To express precisely a comparison relation between complex differential errors, their differential error regions (DERs) were used. To demonstrate the method in the most accurate case of a direct zero-length thru, practical results are presented for commonly used Z-parameters of a simple, two-port, DC resistive T-network, which was built and tested against frequency with a VNA measurement system extended by two lengthy transmission lines.
3867	This research paper presents a novel approach for automating the generation of layout and control for quantum circuits. The proposed method utilizes a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques to generate efficient and error-corrected quantum circuits.

652	"The research paper ""Acyclic Preference Systems in P2P Networks"" explores the concept of acyclic preference systems in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The authors propose a new approach to decentralized decision-making in P2P networks by utilizing acyclic preference systems. They argue that this approach can help to improve the efficiency and fairness of P2P networks, as it allows nodes to make decisions based on their individual preferences without creating cycles or conflicts. The authors also analyze the performance of their proposed approach using simulation experiments and show that it outperforms other commonly used decision-making mechanisms in P2P networks. They conclude that acyclic preference systems can be a promising solution for decentralized decision-making in P2P networks, as they provide a flexible and efficient way to handle individual preferences while avoiding conflicts and cycles."
2699	"The research paper titled ""Tiling models for metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants"" investigates the nature and behavior of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants using various tiling models. The study reveals that the metadislocations are composed of a series of topological defects that can be described using specific tiling patterns. It also demonstrates that the tiling models can provide insights into the structural and mechanical properties of the approximants, including the formation of shear bands and the deformation behavior under stress. The essential conclusion is that the tiling models are useful tools for understanding the complex nature of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants and can aid in the design of new materials with desired properties."
2924	This research paper investigates the potential impact of decoherence on the timing accuracy of quantum-enhanced systems. Decoherence is a major challenge in the development of practical quantum technologies, and its effects on timing accuracy have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of a quantum-enhanced timing system under different levels of decoherence, using both theoretical models and experimental data. Our findings suggest that decoherence can significantly degrade the performance of quantum-enhanced timing systems, and that mitigation techniques may be necessary to maintain high levels of accuracy. These results have important implications for the development of practical quantum timing technologies, and may guide future research in this area.
4037	We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The \pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
343	In a very recent paper, M. Rahman introduced a remarkable family of polynomials in two variables as the eigenfunctions of the transition matrix for a nontrivial Markov chain due to M. Hoare and M. Rahman. I indicate here that these polynomials are bispectral. This should be just one of the many remarkable properties enjoyed by these polynomials. For several challenges, including finding a general proof of some of the facts displayed here the reader should look at the last section of this paper.
2643	We propose a new upper bound for the eavesdropper's information in the direct and reverse reconciliated coherent states quantum key distribution protocols with heterodyne detection.

3035	We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale, nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation.

3908	We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite. In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and complete smooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emery tensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalize arguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.
2175	This research paper explores the influence of opinion leaders on opinion formation in social networks. The main objectives were to study different models of opinion formation and to investigate how the presence of opinion leaders affects the diffusion of opinions. The study found that opinion leaders can significantly impact the spread of opinions in a social network, especially when they have a large following or are perceived as trustworthy. Additionally, the research identified that the type of opinion leader and the timing of their intervention can also affect the diffusion of opinions. These findings have important implications for understanding how opinions are formed and spread in social networks, and suggest that targeted interventions by opinion leaders may be effective in shaping public opinion.
2545	A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization. Relations between symmetries of this theory and the O(d,d) symmetry of the string-inspired models are discussed.

1930	The Extended BP (EBP) Generalized EXIT (GEXIT) function introduced in \cite{MMRU05} plays a fundamental role in the asymptotic analysis of sparse graph codes. For transmission over the binary erasure channel (BEC) the analytic properties of the EBP GEXIT function are relatively simple and well understood. The general case is much harder and even the existence of the curve is not known in general. We introduce some tools from non-linear analysis which can be useful to prove the existence of EXIT like curves in some cases. The main tool is the Krasnoselskii-Rabinowitz (KR) bifurcation theorem.

This approach provides a new tool for understanding the behavior of complex fluids and soft matter systems.
3540	Holzer and Holzer (Discrete Applied Mathematics 144(3):345--358, 2004) proved that the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the solution, which implies that the unique Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP.
280	In this paper, we consider the coordination control of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders. Different interconnection topologies are investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient condition is proved in the case of fixed interconnection topology. Then a sufficient condition is proposed when the interconnection topology is switched. With a simple first-order dynamics model by using the neighborhood rule, both results show that the group behavior of the agents will converge to the polytope formed by the leaders.
3365	"Angular momentum changing collisions can be suppressed in atoms whose valence electrons are submerged beneath filled shells of higher principle quantum number. To determine whether spin-exchange collisions are suppressed in these ""submerged shell"" atoms, we measured spin-exchange collisions of six hyperfine states of Mn at temperatures below 1 K. Although the 3d valence electrons in Mn are submerged beneath a filled 4s orbital, we find that the spin exchange rate coefficients are similar to those of Na and H (which are non-submerged shell atoms)."
1784	We address the problem of &#64257;nding nice labellings for event structures of degree 3. We develop a minimum theory by which we prove that the labelling number of an event structure of degree 3 is bounded by a linear function of the height. The main theorem we present in this paper states that event structures of degree 3 whose causality order is a tree have a nice labelling with 3 colors. Finally, we exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3.
271	This research paper investigates the Sagnac effect, which is a phase shift that occurs in a mesoscopic electron interferometer due to its rotation. The paper focuses on the role of spin-orbit interactions in this effect and demonstrates that they can significantly affect the phase shift. The researchers used a two-path interferometer to measure the phase shift, and they found that it depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the rotation rate of the interferometer. The results suggest that the Sagnac effect can provide a new way to study spin-orbit interactions in mesoscopic systems. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the fundamental physics of mesoscopic systems and has potential applications in quantum computing and sensing.
2206	The IEEE 802.11e standard revises the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the former IEEE 802.11 standard for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision in the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of 802.11e defines multiple Access Categories (AC) with AC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and prioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which incorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic load. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer buffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads, EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.

The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more advanced methods and problems.
3247	This paper considers the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) relay channel where multiple antennas are employed by each terminal. Compared to single-input single-output (SISO) relay channels, MIMO relay channels introduce additional degrees of freedom, making the design and analysis of optimal cooperative strategies more complex. In this paper, a partial cooperation strategy that combines transmit-side message splitting and block-Markov encoding is presented. Lower bounds on capacity that improve on a previously proposed non-cooperative lower bound are derived for Gaussian MIMO relay channels.
D1-13	Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e., law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions (i.e., the law of constant composition), the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions. In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor transmute one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.

Finally, the paper presents the potential benefits and limitations of using quantum simulations in ion traps to study the early universe and discusses future directions for research in this area.
59	We study Casimir forces on the partition in a closed box (piston) with perfect metallic boundary conditions. Related closed geometries have generated interest as candidates for a repulsive force. By using an optical path expansion we solve exactly the case of a piston with a rectangular cross section, and find that the force always attracts the partition to the nearest base. For arbitrary cross sections, we can use an expansion for the density of states to compute the force in the limit of small height to width ratios. The corrections to the force between parallel plates are found to have interesting dependence on the shape of the cross section. Finally, for temperatures in the range of experimental interest we compute finite temperature corrections to the force (again assuming perfect boundaries).
2287	The research paper explores the use of the quasicontinuum (QC) method in modeling the dynamics of a Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model.

The results show that the adaptive QC method accurately captures the behavior of the FK model and reduces computational costs compared to traditional QC methods. The authors conclude that the new method has potential for use in studying more complex systems with atomistic-continuum interactions.
2687	This research paper investigates the blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies and aims to determine whether they are genuine blue stragglers or a young stellar population. Using photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we analyze the color-magnitude diagrams of four dwarf spheroidal galaxies and compare them to theoretical models. Our results suggest that the blue plume population is likely a combination of both genuine blue stragglers and a young stellar population. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and their stellar populations.
188	This paper proposes a novel algorithm for finding error-locators of algebraic-geometric codes that can eliminate the division-calculations of finite fields from the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm. This inverse-free algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors, generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic curves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to, and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each clock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for codes on algebraic curves.
3117	Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables. This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models. Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of noncommutative geometry and its applications in physics and mathematics.
3658	We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement
186	It is known that, in an asymptotically flat spacetime, null infinity cannot act as an initial-value surface for massive real scalar fields. Exploiting tools proper of harmonic analysis on hyperboloids and global norm estimates for the wave operator, we show that it is possible to circumvent such obstruction at least in Minkowski spacetime. Hence we project norm-finite solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation of motion in data on null infinity and, eventually, we interpret them in terms of boundary free field theory.

The thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential of each component and the pressure of the overall system, are incorporated in the model. We derived a symmetrical convection diffusion equation for each component as well as the Navier Stokes equation and continuity equation for the overall system. The algorithm was verified through simulations of binary and ternary systems. The equilibrium concentrations of components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree well with theoretical expectations.

A measurement procedure has been established and followed carefully resulting in a high degree of reproducibility of the measurements. Depending on the ionic concentration as well as the amplitude of the applied voltage, the observed direction of the DC flow component is either forward or reverse. The impedance spectrum has been thoroughly measured and analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit diagram. Our observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with theoretical models published in the literature.
3720	This research paper explores the phenomenon of topology change of black holes, which occurs when the topology of the event horizon transitions from a spherical shape to a non-spherical shape. Through extensive simulations and mathematical modelling, the paper presents evidence that this topology change is a common occurrence in the evolution of black holes. The paper also argues that this phenomenon may have significant implications for our understanding of gravitational waves and the structure of the universe. Ultimately, the paper concludes that topology change of black holes is an important area of study that warrants further research and investigation.

The study utilizes numerical simulations to analyze the behavior of quantum systems under different atomic interaction strengths. The main focus is to understand how these interactions affect the stability and performance of quantum accelerator modes.

The research also highlights the need for further studies to explore the potential of quantum accelerator modes in practical applications.
2527	Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain (PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms. Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.
2126	This research paper examines the phenomenon of scaling anomaly in a cosmic string background. The study focuses on the emergence of a non-trivial scaling behavior in the correlation functions of the string, which is found to be related to the presence of a conformal anomaly.

These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of cosmic strings and their role in the structure of the universe.

Using numerical simulations and observational data, the authors demonstrate that oxygen-rich droplets can form in the outflows of oxygen-rich stars, and that they can survive in the ISM for millions of years. These droplets can also trigger the formation of new stars and planets, and may have played a key role in the evolution of the early universe. The study concludes that oxygen-rich droplets are an important source of oxygen enrichment in the ISM, and that further research is needed to fully understand their impact on the chemical evolution of galaxies.
D1-1	The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
612	"We study theoretically the low-temperature phases of a two-component atomic Fermi gas with attractive s-wave interactions under conditions of rapid rotation. We find that, in the extreme quantum limit, when all particles occupy the lowest Landau level, the normal state is unstable to the formation of ""charge"" density wave (CDW) order. At lower rotation rates, when many Landau levels are occupied, we show that the low-temperature phases can be supersolids, involving both CDW and superconducting order."
14	A model describing the influence of torsion stress on the giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction is proposed. The wire impedance is found by means of the solution of Maxwell equations together with the Landau-Lifshitz equation, assuming a simplified spatial distribution of the magnetoelastic anisotropy induced by the torsion stress. The impedance is analyzed as a function of the external magnetic field, torsion stress and frequency. It is shown that the magnetoimpedance ratio torsion dependence has an asymmetric shape, with a sharp peak at some value of the torsion stress. The calculated field and stress dependences of the impedance are in qualitative agreement with results of the experimental study of the torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in Co-based amorphous wires.
D2-74	Greenland is the world’s largest island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, and is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It is geographically part of North America but politically and historically connected to Europe. Greenland is known for its vast ice sheet, which covers about 80% of the island, making it a critical component of global climate systems. The island’s population is relatively small, primarily consisting of Inuit people. Its economy relies heavily on fishing, while tourism and mining are growing sectors. Greenland has significant natural resources, including minerals and oil, though environmental concerns and the impact of climate change, such as melting ice, are major issues. Greenland’s strategic location has also gained geopolitical importance in recent years.

In this research paper, we investigate the effects of Cr3+ substitution on the local atomic structure of MgAl2O4 using computational methods. Our results demonstrate that the presence of Cr3+ induces significant structural relaxation, leading to changes in bond lengths and angles in the immediate vicinity of the dopant. We also examine the impact of various factors such as temperature and dopant concentration on the relaxation behavior. These findings provide a basis for further exploration of the properties and applications of Cr3+-doped MgAl2O4 materials.
1950	This paper concludes our efforts in describing SU(3)-Yang-Mills theories at different couplings/temperatures in terms of effective Polyakov-loop models. The associated effective couplings are determined through an inverse Monte Carlo procedure based on novel Schwinger-Dyson equations that employ the symmetries of the Haar measure. Due to the first-order nature of the phase transition we encounter a fine-tuning problem in reproducing the correct behavior of the Polyakov-loop from the effective models. The problem remains under control as long as the number of effective couplings is sufficiently small.
3623	This research paper explores the notion of angles between infinite dimensional subspaces, specifically in the context of the Rayleigh-Ritz and alternating projectors methods. The primary theme is to investigate the relationship between these angles and the convergence rates of these two methods. The paper provides a theoretical framework for analyzing these angles and presents several significant findings. One important conclusion is that the convergence rate of the Rayleigh-Ritz method is related to the angle between the subspace generated by the eigenvectors of the matrix and the subspace generated by the trial vectors. Another key finding is that the alternating projectors method converges faster when the angle between the subspaces is smaller. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of these methods and provides insights into their performance in various applications.

1957	Topological T-duality is a transformation taking a gerbe on a principal torus bundle to a gerbe on a principal dual-torus bundle. We give a new geometric construction of T-dualization, which allows the duality to be extended in following two directions. First, bundles of groups other than tori, even bundles of some nonabelian groups, can be dualized. Second, bundles whose duals are families of noncommutative groups (in the sense of noncommutative geometry) can be treated, though in this case the base space of the bundles is best viewed as a topological stack. Some methods developed for the construction may be of independent interest. These are a Pontryagin type duality that interchanges commutative principal bundles with gerbes, a nonabelian Takai type duality for groupoids, and the computation of certain equivariant Brauer groups.
1201	Abstract:Triangulations of projective modules have been a subject of interest in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of triangulations of projective modules over a commutative ring. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of triangulations, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a projective module to admit a triangulation. We also explore the relationship between triangulations of projective modules and tilting modules, and give examples of how triangulations can be used to study representation theory. Finally, we discuss applications of triangulations in algebraic geometry, including the construction of moduli spaces and the study of the derived category of coherent sheaves. Our results have implications for a wide range of topics in mathematics, including algebraic topology, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry.

2220	We construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the Higgs mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections, using ideas originally discussed by Lee and Wick in the context of a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrangian includes new higher derivative operators. We show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by introducing a set of auxiliary fields; this allows for convenient computation and makes the physical interpretation more transparent. Although the theory is unitary, it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions.

D1-4	A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It has no mass, no electric charge, and always moves at the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum). Photons carry energy and momentum, which depend on their wavelength or frequency. Higher frequency photons (like X-rays) have more energy, while lower frequency photons (like radio waves) have less. Their energy is given by Planck’s equation:E = h f, where E is energy, h is Planck’s constant, and f is frequency.Photons behave as both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), meaning they can interfere, diffract, and be absorbed/emitted like particles. They are responsible for vision, photosynthesis, solar power, and many quantum phenomena.
D2-85	A PET scan, or Positron Emission Tomography, is a sophisticated imaging technique used in healthcare to visualize the metabolic processes within the body. It involves the injection of a radioactive tracer, often a glucose analog, into the patient. As the tracer interacts with body tissues, it emits positrons, which collide with electrons, resulting in the release of gamma rays. These emissions are detected by the PET scanner, which constructs a detailed image showing the distribution and activity of the tracer within the body. Unlike structural imaging methods such as CT scans or MRIs, a PET scan provides functional information, highlighting areas of high metabolic activity. This makes it particularly valuable in diagnosing and assessing conditions like cancer, heart disease,  neurological disorders.
2416	Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient approximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the migration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for coarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain boundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an intrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline metals.
484	"The research paper titled ""Multiparameter Riesz Commutators"" focuses on the study of singular integral operators and their commutators with various functions. The authors propose a new class of commutators, called multiparameter Riesz commutators, which are defined as the difference between a singular integral operator and a Riesz transform operator applied to a given function. The main objective of the paper is to establish the boundedness of these commutators on various function spaces. The authors obtain several results on the boundedness of these commutators on weighted Lebesgue spaces, Morrey spaces, and BMO spaces. They also provide some applications of these results in the study of partial differential equations. The paper concludes that the multiparameter Riesz commutators provide a useful tool for the analysis of singular integral operators and their commutators, and can be applied to various problems in mathematics and physics."
D1-6	The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth’s lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These movements shape the planet, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. The theory builds on continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, and is supported by evidence from seafloor spreading, fossil distribution, and geological formations. Plates move apart at divergent boundaries, collide at convergent boundaries, and slide past each other at transform boundaries. Their movement is driven by mantle convection, gravity, and Earth’s rotation, constantly reshaping the surface. This theory is essential for understanding natural disasters and the geological evolution of continents.

The paper concludes that the study of Polyakov loops and quasiparticles in QCD can provide valuable insights into the nature of the transition between confined and deconfined phases.
139	We investigate the dissipative real-time evolution of the order parameter for the deconfining transition in the pure SU(2) gauge theory. The approach to equilibrium after a quench to temperatures well above the critical one is described by a Langevin equation. To fix completely the markovian Langevin dynamics we choose the dissipation coefficient, that is a function of the temperature, guided by preliminary Monte Carlo simulations for various temperatures. Assuming a relationship between Monte Carlo time and real time, we estimate the delay in thermalization brought about by dissipation and noise.
1372	This research paper investigates the magnetic properties of Sm2Al, a rare earth compound with a unique electronic structure. Through experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that Sm2Al exhibits spin-orbital compensation, a phenomenon where the spin and orbital magnetic moments cancel out each other. This compensation leads to an overall weak ferromagnetic behavior in Sm2Al, which is unlike other known ferromagnets. Our findings provide further insights into the complex interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in rare earth materials and can potentially pave the way for the development of novel magnetic materials with tailored properties.

In this study, we use a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques to investigate how gate voltage affects Kondo physics in graphene. Our results show that gate voltage can be used to tune Kondo physics in graphene, with the strength of the Kondo effect increasing with increasing gate voltage. This study provides valuable insights into the potential use of graphene in spintronics and quantum computing applications.

The main conclusion of the article is that extracting falsifiable predictions from sloppy models can help to advance scientific understanding and improve the reliability of research findings.
3355	We demonstrate the operation of a differential single Cooper-pair box, a charge qubit consisting of two aluminum islands, isolated from ground, coupled by a pair of small-area Josephson junctions, and read out with a superconducting differential radio-frequency single electron transistor. We have tested four devices, all of which show evidence of quasiparticle poisoning. The devices are characterized with microwave spectroscopy and temperature dependence studies, and Coulomb staircases are shown to be e-periodic in all samples. However, coherent control is still possible with non-adiabatic voltage pulses. Coherent oscillation experiments and a relaxation time measurement were performed using a charge derivative readout technique.
2051	In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons, forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.

3078	Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass exo-planets.
3399	This research paper examines the use of core and half-mass radii ratios as a tool for identifying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in star clusters.

The paper highlights the importance of considering various factors, such as cluster size, age, and initial conditions, when interpreting observed ratios. The findings have significant implications for the search for IMBHs in star clusters and suggest that alternative methods may be necessary for their detection.

3115	"A parametric study of so-called ""super growth"" of single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminum oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs. Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates."
2730	We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.
2426	We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple and general tool for lifting additivity results.
1736	A SU(4) flavor symmetrical Lagrangian is constructed for the interaction of the pseudo-scalar mesons with the vector mesons. SU(4) symmetry is broken to SU(3) by suppression of terms in the Lagrangian where the interaction should be driven by charmed mesons. Chiral symmetry can be restored by setting this new SU(4) symmetry breaking parameters to zero. Unitarization in coupled channels leads to the dynamical generation of resonances. Many known axial resonances can be identified including the new controversial X(3872) and the structure found recently by Belle around 3875 MeV in the hidden charm sector. Also new resonances are predicted, some of them with exotic quantum numbers.

Additionally, it is discovered that the oscillation bands can be controlled by tuning the interaction strength between the atoms in the condensates. These findings have important implications for the understanding and manipulation of condensates in ring-shaped systems.

145	In this paper, we consider the coordination control of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders. Different interconnection topologies are investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient condition is proved in the case of fixed interconnection topology. Then a sufficient condition is proposed when the interconnection topology is switched. With a simple first-order dynamics model by using the neighborhood rule, both results show that the group behavior of the agents will converge to the polytope formed by the leaders.
D2-69	Lavoisier was born in 1743 into a wealthy family of lawyers, and initially prepared for a legal career, being awarded a baccalaureate in law in 1763.

This chapter critically examines the analytical conception of the elements that Lavoisier proposes.

The derivation is generally valid for insulators with or without a Chern number, for metals at zero or finite temperatures, and at weak as well as strong magnetic fields. The formula is shown to be valid in the presence of electron-electron interaction, provided the one-electron energies and wave functions are calculated self-consistently within the framework of the exact current and spin density functional theory.

1659	Deformation Theory is a natural generalization of Lie Theory, from Lie groups and their linearization, Lie algebras, to differential graded Lie algebras and their higher order deformations, quantum groups. The article focuses on two basic constructions of deformation theory: the universal solution of Maurer-Cartan Equation (MCE), which plays the role of the exponential of Lie Theory, and its inverse, the Kuranishi functor, as the logarithm. The deformation functor is the gauge reduction of MCE, corresponding to a Hodge decomposition associated to the strong deformation retract data. The above comparison with Lie Theory leads to a better understanding of Deformation Theory and its applications, e.g. the relation between quantization and Connes-Kreimer renormalization, quantum doubles and Birkhoff decomposition.
3299	The recent detection of the hydrocarbon anion C6H- in the interstellar medium has led us to investigate the synthesis of hydrocarbon anions in a variety of interstellar and circumstellar environments. We find that the anion/neutral abundance ratio can be quite large, on the order of at least a few percent, once the neutral has more than five carbon atoms. Detailed modeling shows that the column densities of C6H- observed in IRC+10216 and TMC-1 can be reproduced. Our calculations also predict that other hydrocarbon anions, such as C4H- and C8H-, are viable candidates for detection in IRC+10216, TMC-1 and photon-dominated regions such as the Horsehead Nebula.

These findings provide insights into the dynamics of populations with neutral mutations and have implications for conservation biology.

The study involved analyzing the variability of the source over a period of two years and examining any periodic patterns that may be present. The results suggest that J1128+5925 does exhibit a possible annual modulation, which could have important implications for our understanding of the source and its environment. However, further observations and analysis are needed to confirm this finding.
2880	A recent polarized x-ray absorption experiment on the high temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 indicates the presence of broken parity symmetry below the temperature, T*, where a pseudogap appears in photoemission. We critically analyze the x-ray data, and conclude that a parity-breaking signal of the kind suggested is unlikely based on the crystal structures reported in the literature. Possible other origins of the observed dichroism signal are discussed. We propose x-ray scattering experiments that can be done in order to determine whether such alternative interpretations are valid or not.
507	Theory of magnetic deflagration (avalanches) in crystals of molecular magnets has been developed. The phenomenon resembles the burning of a chemical substance, with the Zeeman energy playing the role of the chemical energy. Non-destructive reversible character of magnetic deflagration, as well as the possibility to continuously tune the flammability of the crystal by changing the magnetic field, makes molecular magnets an attractive toy system for a detailed study of the burning process. Besides simplicity, new features, as compared to the chemical burning, include possibility of quantum decay of metastable spin states and strong temperature dependence of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions for criteria of the ignition of magnetic deflagration, and compute the ignition rate and the speed of the developed deflagration front.

In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls.

3673	The study focuses on the evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows over a gradual slope with bottom friction. The researchers used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of varying parameters such as wave amplitude, fluid depth, and bottom friction on the characteristics of these waves. They found that the presence of bottom friction causes the waves to dissipate energy and change their shape and speed. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of these waves in order to better predict and manage hazards such as coastal flooding. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of shallow-water waves and their interactions with the underlying substrate.
2449	"The research paper titled ""Illusion of Control"" in Minority and Parrondo Games explores the concept of illusion of control in two types of games. The primary theme is to investigate how players perceive their control over the game outcomes, even when the game is designed to be unpredictable and random. The significant finding of the study is that players in the minority game exhibited a higher level of illusion of control than in Parrondo games. The study concludes that players' perception of control may affect their decision-making in games and real-life situations, leading to unexpected outcomes."
1152	We provide an epistemological analysis of the developments of relativistic cosmology from 1917 to 2006, based on the seminal articles by Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lemaitre, Hubble, Gamow and other main historical figures of the field. It appears that most of the ingredients of the present-day standard cosmological model, such as the accelation of the expansion due to a repulsive dark energy, the interpretation of the cosmological constant as vacuum energy or the possible non-trivial topology of space, had been anticipated by Lemaitre, although his papers remain desperately unquoted.
2244	We present an atomistic three-dimensional simulation of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNR-FETs), based on the self-consistent solution of the 3D Poisson and Schroedinger equation with open boundary conditions within the non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism and a tight-binding hamiltonian. With respect to carbon nanotube FETs, GNR-FETs exhibit comparable performance, reduced sensitivity on the variability of channel chirality, and similar leakage problems due to band-to-band tunneling. Acceptable transistor performance requires effective nanoribbon width of 1-2 nm, that could be obtained with periodic etching patterns or stress patterns.
1321	Erwin Schrodinger (1939) proved that quantum wave functions coevolve with the curved spacetime of the Friedmann universe. Schrodinger's derivation explains the Hubble redshift of photons in an expanding universe, the energy changes of moving particles, and establishes the coevolution of atoms and other quantum systems with spacetime geometry. The assumption often made that small quantum systems are isolated and that their properties remain constant as the Friedmann universe evolves is incompatible with relativistic quantum mechanics and with general relativity.
1328	Many index theorems (both classical and in noncommutative geometry) can be interpreted in terms of a Lie groupoid acting properly on a manifold and leaving an elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators invariant. Alain Connes in his book raised the question of an index theorem in this general context. In this paper, an analytic index for many such situations is constructed. The approach is inspired by the classical families theorem of Atiyah and Singer, and the proof generalizes, to the case of proper Lie groupoid actions, some of the results proved for proper locally compact group actions by N. C. Phillips.
1102	The research paper explores the coupling of phonons and spin waves in a triangular antiferromagnet. The authors use neutron scattering experiments and theoretical calculations to investigate the interactions between the lattice vibrations and magnetic excitations in this system. They find that the coupling between the phonons and spin waves is stronger than previously thought, leading to novel effects such as the emergence of hybrid modes. The study provides insights into the fundamental physics of magnetic materials and has potential implications for the development of spintronic devices.
1774	In this paper we study the interaction between two-level atom and quantized single-mode field, namely, Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). The field and the atom are initially prepared in the binomial state and the excited atomic state, respectively. For this system we prove that the revival-collapse phenomenon exhibited in the atomic inversion of the standard JCM can be numerically (naturally) manifested in the evolution of the squeezing factor of the three-photon (standard) JCM provided that the initial photon-number distribution of the radiation has a smooth envelope.
2944	The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen, ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed. Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals, reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
330	This research paper aims to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms in object-oriented database systems. The study compares four clustering algorithms, namely, k-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and hierarchical clustering, based on their clustering quality and runtime efficiency.

Based on the findings, this paper provides insights and recommendations for selecting appropriate clustering algorithms for object-oriented database systems to optimize clustering quality and runtime efficiency.
D1-28	Significant climatic oscillations on sub-centurial (50–55 years, 60–65 years) and quasi-centurial (120–130 years) timescales are thought to arise from natural variability in Earth's climate system, driven by a combination of internal processes and external forcing mechanisms. The causes of these oscillations include: Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are large-scale oceanic patterns of variability that operate on multidecadal timescales (50–70 years). These affect global heat distribution, weather patterns, and long-term climate trends. Solar Variability Variations in solar activity, such as the Gleissberg Cycle (~80–120 years), impact Earth's climate. Changes in solar irradiance affect atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation, and surface temperatures.

The study focuses on analyzing the chemical composition of these galaxies and comparing them with the current understanding of stellar evolution and galaxy formation. The results indicate that the metal-poor galaxies are indeed young, with the majority of them being less than 1 billion years old. This conclusion challenges some previous assumptions and understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, suggesting that metal-poor galaxies may be a unique and important population to study further. The research also highlights the need for future observations and studies to better understand the formation and evolution of these intriguing galaxies.
866	We survey the few exact results on the Stormer problem describing the dynamics of charged particles in the Earth magnetosphere. The analysis of this system leads to the the conclusion that charged particles are trapped in the Earth magnetosphere or escape to infinity, and the trapping region is bounded by a torus-like surface, the Van Allen inner radiation belt. In the trapping region, the motion of the charged particles can be periodic, quasi-period or chaotic. The three main effects observed in the Earth magnetosphere, radiation belts, radiation aurorae and South Atlantic anomaly, are described in the framework described here. We discuss some new mathematical problems suggested by the analysis of the Stormer problem.
D2-49	"According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single ""Primorial Particle"". ""Divine Volition"", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology."
732	This research paper focuses on the redistribution of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a quasiperiodic optical lattice. The study investigates the impact of lattice potential on the dynamics of solitons in BEC. The authors demonstrate that the quasiperiodic lattice potential can trigger the redistribution of solitons in BEC, leading to significant changes in the system's behavior.

246	This research paper focuses on the formation of fluctuations in a molecular slab through isobaric thermal instability. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate that thermal fluctuations caused by the instability can lead to density fluctuations in the slab. The results suggest that this process could be responsible for the formation of molecular clouds in the interstellar medium. The paper concludes that isobaric thermal instability is a significant mechanism for the formation of density fluctuations in molecular slabs, and further research is necessary to investigate its implications in astrophysical environments.
3492	We present a new interatomic potential for water captured in a charge-transfer embedded atom method (EAM) framework. The potential accounts for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms as a function of the local chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of water.
1691	The research paper explores the chaotic and complex behavior of quantum systems, focusing on the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of a quantum particle in a potential well, revealing the emergence of chaotic behavior as the system evolves. The paper concludes that the complexity of quantum motion is a fundamental property of the quantum world, and that classical mechanics cannot fully explain the behavior of quantum systems. The findings highlight the need for a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for future technological advancements.
3529	This research paper aims to investigate the role of elastic stresses in the development of leaf venation patterns. Leaf venation plays a crucial role in plant physiology as it facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the leaf. However, the mechanisms that regulate the formation of venation patterns are not fully understood. In this study, we hypothesize that elastic stresses, resulting from differential growth rates in different regions of the leaf, play a significant role in the development of venation patterns. We will use computational simulations to model the growth and development of leaves under different elastic stress conditions. We will also examine the venation patterns of actual leaves under different experimental conditions. Our results will provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate leaf venation morphogenesis and could contribute to the development of more efficient plant engineering techniques.
713	In this work the influence of the electric and magnetic fields over a tunneling particle in a rectangular potential barrier is shown, we have taken into account the presence of an impurity at the barrier center and the effects of a hydrostatic pressure parallel to the barrier height considering the BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions. Given that the particle is moving inside a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heterostructures it is evident a change in the transmission coefficient due to the impurity concentration and the presence of the hydrostatic pressure. The potential due to the presence of the impurity is approximate with a second degree polynomial function that resolves the discontinuity generated by heavily modifying the transmission coefficient.
2851	Starting from the reduced dynamical model of a two-junction quantum interference device, a quantum analog of the system has been exhibited, in order to extend the well known properties of this device to the quantum regime. By finding eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator, the persistent currents flowing in the ring have been obtained. The resulting quantum analog of the overdamped two-junction quantum interference device can be seen as a supercurrent qubit operating in the limit of negligible capacitance and finite inductance.
1697	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of phylogenetic mixtures, where multiple evolutionary processes occur on a single tree. The study finds that these mixtures can create a tree topology that mimics another, despite being distinct in their underlying evolutionary processes. The research provides insights into the potential pitfalls of inferring evolutionary relationships based solely on tree topology and highlights the importance of considering multiple evolutionary processes in phylogenetic analysis. The findings suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting tree topologies and emphasize the need for more comprehensive approaches to phylogenetic analysis.
1349	We consider higher-derivative perturbations of quantum gravity and quantum field theories in curved space and investigate tools to calculate counterterms and short-distance expansions of Feynman diagrams. In the case of single higher-derivative insertions we derive a closed formula that relates the perturbed one-loop counterterms to the unperturbed Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients. In the more general case, we classify the contributions to the short-distance expansion and outline a number of simplification methods. Certain difficulties of the common differential technique in the presence of higher-derivative perturbations are avoided by a systematic use of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, which in some cases reduces the computational effort considerably.
288	In this paper, we study the moduli space of toric vector bundles over a toric variety. We provide a detailed analysis of the geometry and topology of the moduli space, and establish several important results. Specifically, we show that the moduli space is smooth and projective, and that it admits a natural stratification by stability conditions. Additionally, we establish a connection between the moduli space and the combinatorial structure of the associated toric fan. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between geometry and combinatorics in the theory of toric varieties, and offer new insights into the properties of toric vector bundles.
D2-30	More than 1,900 species of edible insects are consumed worldwide. However, this number continues to increase as more studies are carried out on this issue. Most of these known species are collected directly from the natural environment, but available data on the amounts of insects that are ingested worldwide are scarce. In any case, there is agreement that of the hundreds of insect species used as human food worldwide, the most common can be encompassed into four groups: beetles; ants, bees and wasps; grasshoppers and crickets and, finally, moths, caterpillars, and butterflies. According to FAO, the most consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera, 31%), caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 18%) and bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera, 14%).

1397	We have performed self-consistent 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD numerical simulations of jet formation as long as possible, including the dynamics of accretion disks. Although the previous nonsteady MHD simulations for astrophysical jets revealed that the characteristics of nonsteady jets are similar to those of steady jets, the calculation time of these simulations is very short compared with the time scale of observed jets. Thus we have investigated long term evolutions of mass accretion rate, mass outflow rate, jet velocity, and various energy flux. We found that the ejection of jet is quasi-periodic. The period of the ejection is related to the time needed for the initial magnetic filed to be twisted to generate toroidal filed. We compare our results with both the steady state theory and previous 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD simulations.

The main objective of the study is to investigate the universal temperature scaling behavior of flux line pinning in these films. The researchers have conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of flux line pinning as a function of temperature. The crucial finding of the study is that the flux line pinning force scales with the temperature according to a universal power law. This behavior has been observed in various high-temperature superconducting thin films, and the researchers have concluded that it could be a general feature of these materials. These findings could have significant implications for the development of high-temperature superconducting devices and applications.
1425	We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.
2722	The Feynman propagator has nonzero values outside of the forward light cone. That does not allow messages to be transmitted faster than the speed of light, but it is shown here that it does allow entanglement and mutual information to be generated at space-like separated points. These effects can be interpreted as being due to the propagation of virtual photons outside of the light cone or as a transfer of pre-existing entanglement from the quantum vacuum. The differences between these two interpretations are discussed.
562	We present two theoretical schemes for spin filters in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as well as weak magnetic potential. For case I, the SOC is periodic and the weak magnetic potential is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy intervals. For case II, the weak magnetic potential is periodic while the SOC is uniform. An ideal negative/positive switching effect for spin polarization is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, magnetic potential, and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed.
1908	In this article we show that the Holevo capacity of a classical quantum channel, can be reached not only by a POVM but by von Neumann measurement too. Furthermore we show two use of this fact 1) We can generalize the classical compound channel to quantum environment and with this new measure technique we can give an optimal coding/decoding algorithm to it. 2) We give an algorithm, with it a classical system can be decoded by quantum apparatus in linear time, which is a surprising result, because best known optimal classical decoding algorithm need n*log(n) time. This means that if a quantum machine can perform arbitrarily von Neumann measurement with only two possible outcome, then it can solve non-polynomial classical problems in linear time.

The critical outcomes of this study include a better understanding of the complex interaction between design parameters, the development of an efficient optimization methodology for prismatic drives, and the identification of the optimal design for multiobjective optimization. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of prismatic drives in various applications.

The study utilizes numerical simulations of a non-equilibrium system to investigate the validity of existing hypotheses regarding entropy production. The results suggest that these hypotheses may not hold true in non-linear systems, and therefore, new approaches are needed to explain the behavior of such systems. The study highlights the importance of considering non-linear systems in our understanding of entropy production and sheds light on the limitations of current hypotheses.

Our analysis reveals a significant number of galaxies with tidal tails, with a higher incidence of smooth tails in the GEMS field and starburst tails in the GOODS field. We also find that the presence of tidal tails is correlated with other galaxy properties, such as size, mass, and star formation rate. Our findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe.
D2-55	In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.

The authors found that there are significant variations in the behavior of different high-Tc cuprates in the Josephson vortex state, and these disparities may be related to the materials' fundamental properties. These findings have implications for the development of new superconducting materials and technologies. Overall, this research sheds light on an important aspect of high-Tc cuprate physics and provides valuable insights into the behavior of these materials.
D2-38	The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS .
769	This paper examines the joint problem of detection and identification of a sudden and unobservable change in the probability distribution function (pdf) of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables to one of finitely many alternative pdf's. The objective is quick detection of the change and accurate inference of the ensuing pdf. Following a Bayesian approach, a new sequential decision strategy for this problem is revealed and is proven optimal. Geometrical properties of this strategy are demonstrated via numerical examples.

In this study, we investigate the acoustic resonances that occur within microfluidic chips and their effects on fluid flow using full-image micro-PIV experiments and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that acoustic resonances can significantly alter the flow patterns in microfluidic chips, leading to the development of new flow structures and enhancing mixing efficiency.

Overall, our findings provide insights into the fundamental understanding of acoustic resonances in microfluidic chips and their potential applications in enhancing fluid manipulation and mixing.
216	Optimal delay-throughput trade-offs for two-dimensional i.i.d mobility models have been established in [23], where we showed that the optimal trade-offs can be achieved using rate-less codes when the required delay guarantees are sufficient large. In this paper, we extend the results to other mobility models including two-dimensional hybrid random walk model, one-dimensional i.i.d. mobility model and one-dimensional hybrid random walk model. We consider both fast mobiles and slow mobiles, and establish the optimal delay-throughput trade-offs under some conditions. Joint coding-scheduling algorithms are also proposed to achieve the optimal trade-offs.
2358	The nucleation of carbon nanotubes on small nickel clusters is studied using a tight binding model coupled to grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. This technique closely follows the conditions of the synthesis of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition. The possible formation of a carbon cap on the catalyst particle is studied as a function of the carbon chemical potential, for particles of different size, either crystalline or disordered. We show that these parameters strongly influence the structure of the cap/particle interface which in turn will have a strong effect on the control of the structure of the nanotube. In particular, we discuss the presence of carbon on surface or in subsurface layers.

The conclusion suggests that the multiresolution approximation algorithm has significant potential for applications in computer graphics, image processing, and other related fields.
1125	We present in this paper the changes in the room temperature magnetic property of ZnO on Mn doping prepared using solvo-thermal process. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation of undoped ZnO showed bifurcation and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. Upon Mn doping the magnetic hysteresis at room temperature and the bifurcation in ZFC-FC magnetization vanishes. The results seem to indicate that undoped ZnO is ferromagnetic while on the other hand the Mn doped ZnO is not a ferromagnetic system. We observe that on addition of Mn atoms the system shows antiferromagnetism with very giant magnetic moments.

2760	This research paper presents a comprehensive modeling of the solar chromosphere, a highly dynamic layer of the Sun's atmosphere, using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The study reveals that the chromosphere is influenced by various physical processes, including magnetic fields, shock waves, and turbulence. The simulations also suggest that the chromosphere plays a crucial role in the formation of the Sun's outer atmosphere and the initiation of space weather events. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex behavior of the Sun and its impact on the Earth's environment.
3060	The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and repulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.
917	A novel strongly nonlinear laminar metamaterial supporting new types of solitary and shock waves with impact energy mitigating capabilities is presented. It consists of steel plates with intermittent polymer toroidal rings acting as strongly nonlinear springs with large allowable strain. Their force-displacement relationship is described by the addition of two power-law relationships resulting in a solitary wave speed and width depending on the amplitude. This double nonlinearity allows splitting of an initial impulse into two separate strongly nonlinear solitary wave trains. Solitary and shock waves are observed experimentally and analyzed numerically in an assembly with Teflon o-rings.
2992	We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
3507	This research paper investigates the effect of wave interference on the performance of a polymer microstadium laser. The primary theme focuses on the impact of the interference on the laser's output power, quality factor, and threshold. The study found that the wave interference significantly affects the laser's characteristics, indicating the need for precise control over the laser's dimensions and positioning. The research concludes that wave interference can be utilized to enhance the laser's performance and tailor its emission properties for specific applications.
D2-24	Entomophagy—the practice of consuming insects as food—has deep historical roots in many cultures worldwide, with approximately 2 billion people regularly incorporating insects into their diets. While Western societies have traditionally viewed insects with disgust, growing environmental and food security concerns have sparked renewed interest in this protein source. Nutritionally, edible insects offer impressive benefits. Most species provide complete proteins containing all essential amino acids, often at higher concentrations than conventional meats. Many insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins, while containing healthy fats including omega-3 fatty acids. Cricket flour, for example, contains approximately 60-70% protein by weight, exceeding most plant and animal sources.
108	The study focuses on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars. The researchers used numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of these fields in different rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. They found that in some cases, the poloidal magnetic fields can become unstable and create toroidal magnetic fields, which can lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field from the star. This process is known as the Tayler instability. The researchers also found that the strength of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the poloidal magnetic field. The study's outcomes suggest that poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars can be unstable and lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field, which can have significant implications for star formation and evolution.
1970	In a global analysis of the latest parity-violating electron scattering measurements on nuclear targets, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the experimental knowledge of the weak neutral-current lepton-quark interactions at low energy. The precision of this new result, combined with earlier atomic parity-violation measurements, places tight constraints on the size of possible contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, this result improves the lower-bound on the scale of relevant new physics to ~1 TeV.
2920	The research paper presents a multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA. The study focuses on the electronic properties of DNA when it is subjected to mechanical stress, such as stretching. The findings suggest that stretching causes a significant increase in the localization of electronic states, leading to a decrease in conductivity. The study also reveals that the degree of localization is highly dependent on the stretch direction and magnitude, as well as the DNA sequence and structure. The multiscale model provides a comprehensive understanding of electronic properties of DNA under mechanical stress and can contribute to the design of new DNA-based electronic devices.
D2-70	Lavoisier’s law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This fundamental principle, proposed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, is crucial to the field of chemistry and science in general. It laid the foundation for modern chemistry by establishing that the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of products. This law enabled scientists to develop more accurate chemical equations and understand that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or annihilation. Lavoisier’s law was vital in refuting earlier theories like the phlogiston theory and is key to stoichiometry.
2594	The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson, becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode. The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.
3157	This research paper explores the cross-layer optimization of MIMO-based mesh networks with Gaussian vector broadcast channels. The aim of this study is to enhance the performance of wireless mesh networks by optimizing the transmission rate and power allocation across different layers of the network stack, including the physical layer, MAC layer, and network layer. The study employs a MIMO-based approach, which utilizes multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to increase the network capacity and improve the signal quality. The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed approach using simulation experiments and analyzes the impact of different parameters such as channel conditions, power constraints, and network topology on the network performance. The results of this study can be used to design efficient and scalable wireless mesh networks that can support high-bandwidth applications and services.
11	This research paper explores the application of lens space surgeries on A'Campo's divide knots. These knots are known for their intricate structure and topological properties, and lens space surgeries provide a powerful tool for investigating their behavior. We begin by reviewing the basic theory of A'Campo's divide knots and their associated invariants. We then introduce the concept of lens space surgeries and discuss their potential applications to these knots. We provide a detailed analysis of the effects of lens space surgeries on A'Campo's divide knots, including the changes in their invariants and the resulting topological structures. Our results show that lens space surgeries can significantly alter the properties of these knots, leading to new insights into their behavior and potential applications in various fields of mathematics and physics.
966	We report on measurements of an elementary surface mode in an ultracold, strongly interacting Fermi gas of 6Li atoms. The radial quadrupole mode allows us to probe hydrodynamic behavior in the BEC-BCS crossover without being influenced by changes in the equation of state. We examine frequency and damping of this mode, along with its expansion dynamics. In the unitarity limit and on the BEC side of the resonance, the observed frequencies agree with standard hydrodynamic theory. However, on the BCS side of the crossover, a striking down shift of the oscillation frequency is observed in the hydrodynamic regime as a precursor to an abrupt transition to collisionless behavior; this indicates coupling of the oscillation to fermionic pairs.
2953	This research paper examines the relationship between entropic measure and Wasserstein diffusion, two mathematical tools commonly used in probability theory and analysis. The paper presents new theoretical results on the use of entropic measure to analyze the behavior of Wasserstein diffusion, and demonstrates the applicability of these results through several numerical simulations. The main conclusion of the paper is that entropic measure can provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior of Wasserstein diffusion, particularly in cases where traditional analytical methods are insufficient. This has potential applications in fields such as finance, biology, and physics, where understanding the behavior of stochastic processes is crucial for making accurate predictions and designing effective models.
914	Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are variable on a wide range of timescales, though relatively few systematic variability surveys have been conducted. Previous broad-band (both spectral and temporal) variability surveys of AGN are limited in their temporal and spectral bandwidth, despite their promise for probing the central engine and black hole mass. We outline optimal properties for variability studies and provide a brief summary of three new variability surveys, two (BATSS and DASCH) about to begin and the third (EXIST) possible within the next decade, which will open new windows on the physics and fundamental properties of AGN.
586	We demonstrate an integral gated mode single photon detector at telecom wavelengths. The charge number of an avalanche pulse rather than the peak current is monitored for single-photon detection. The transient spikes in conventional gated mode operation are canceled completely by integrating, which enables one to improve the performance of single photon detector greatly with the same avalanche photodiode. This method has achieved a detection efficiency of 29.9% at the dark count probability per gate equal to 5.57E-6/gate (1.11E-6/ns) at 1550nm.
1302	This research paper presents a spectroscopic investigation of spin zero homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the electronic structures and vibrational properties of these molecules through the use of various spectroscopic techniques. The experimental methods employed include infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results obtained from these experiments are analyzed and compared to theoretical predictions, providing insight into the nature of the chemical bonds and the molecular properties of these systems. The findings of this study have important implications for the understanding of molecular structure and bonding, and could have potential applications in fields such as materials science and pharmaceuticals.
3030	This research paper investigates the scalar self-force on eccentric geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime using a time-domain computation. The self-force is computed using the mode-sum regularization method and is shown to be dependent on the eccentricity of the geodesic. Results indicate that the scalar self-force can significantly alter the trajectory of the geodesic, leading to precession and changes in the orbital period. The study provides insight into the behavior of self-forces in curved spacetimes and has implications for the understanding of gravitational dynamics in extreme environments.
52	This research paper presents a performance analysis for multichannel reception of Orthogonal Offset Frequency Shift Keying (OOFSK) signaling. The main theme of the study is to investigate the impact of the number of channels on the system's performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and throughput. The researchers conducted simulations using different numbers of channels and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The results show that increasing the number of channels improves the system's performance, particularly at low SNRs. However, the improvement in BER saturates beyond a certain number of channels. Furthermore, the study also reveals that increasing the number of channels may not necessarily lead to an increase in throughput. The research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of multichannel communication systems using OOFSK signaling.
173	The discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation. In contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models, in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization, together with a fine-tuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations, render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur. The energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations.
1768	A finite element method is presented to compute time harmonic microwave fields in three dimensional configurations. Nodal-based finite elements have been coupled with an absorbing boundary condition to solve open boundary problems. This paper describes how the modeling of large devices has been made possible using parallel computation, New algorithms are then proposed to implement this formulation on a cluster of workstations (10 DEC ALPHA 300X) and on a CRAY C98. Analysis of the computation efficiency is performed using simple problems. The electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave by a perfect electric conducting airplane is finally given as example.
2794	The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is a phenomenon where the repeated measurement of a quantum system can prevent it from evolving. In this paper, the authors investigate the QZE in the context of the Decoherent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics. They show that the QZE can occur in this framework, but it is dependent on the chosen set of histories. They also find that the QZE can be used to control the decoherence of quantum systems. The authors conclude that the QZE can have practical applications in quantum technologies, such as quantum error correction.
454	"The research paper titled ""Improving Estimates of Monotone Functions by Rearrangement"" presents a novel approach to improve the estimation of monotone functions in the presence of noise. The proposed method involves rearranging the input data to reduce the effects of noise and improve the accuracy of the estimate. The paper provides a theoretical framework for the method and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulation studies and real-world examples. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The paper also discusses the limitations and potential extensions of the method. Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of function estimation and has important implications for various applications such as signal processing, machine learning, and finance."
1808	Shear zone formation is investigated in slow 3D shear flows. We simulate the linear version of the split-bottom shear cell. It is shown that the same type of wide shear zones is achieved in the presence as well as in the absence of gravity. We investigate the relaxation of the material towards a stationary flow and analyze the stress and the velocity fields. We provide the functional form of the widening of the shear zone inside the bulk. We discuss the growth of the region where the material is in critical state. It is found that the growth of the critical zone is responsible for the initial transient of the shear zone.
2975	The First Law for Boosted Kaluza-Klein Black Holes is a research paper that investigates the thermodynamics of black holes in higher-dimensional spacetimes. The study focuses on black holes with Kaluza-Klein theories, which include additional compact dimensions beyond the usual four-dimensional spacetime. The paper derives the first law of thermodynamics for boosted Kaluza-Klein black holes and analyzes its implications. The results reveal that the first law behaves similarly to the traditional four-dimensional case, but with additional terms related to the compact dimensions. The research provides a new understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes in higher-dimensional spacetimes and contributes to the ongoing study of black hole physics.
1766	We construct a hierarchy of lattice fermions, where the coarser lattice Dirac operator is the Schur complement of the block UL decomposition of the finer lattice operator. We show that the construction is an exact gauged renormalisation group transformation of the lattice action. In particular, using such a transformation and the QCDLAB tool, it is shown how to implement the Ginsparg-Wilson strategy for chiral fermions in the presence of a dynamical gauge field. The scheme allows, for the first time, a full multigrid algorithm for lattice quarks.
3925	The article reports on observations of the Carina Nebula with the Suzaku X-ray satellite, which revealed diffuse X-ray emission from the region. The authors discuss the possible sources of this emission, including shock heating from winds and supernova explosions, and conclude that the most likely explanation is X-ray emission from hot plasma associated with the nebula's ionized gas. The study provides new insights into the physical properties of the Carina Nebula and the processes that drive its evolution.
2982	"Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation is studied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external driving force has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though the reaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This ""driven activation"" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius expression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from the fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by analytical results for a simplified model system."
436	This research paper presents a study of unified quantum invariants and their refinements for homology 3-spheres with 2-torsion. The main theme of the research is to develop a unified framework for quantum invariants, which includes both the Heegaard Floer and Khovanov-Rozansky theories. The paper presents a refined version of these invariants, which provides a more accurate and complete understanding of the topology of 3-manifolds. The paper also includes important results and conclusions, such as the discovery of new invariants, the computation of previously unknown invariants, and the establishment of relationships between different invariants. Overall, the research contributes to the development of a deeper understanding of the topology of 3-manifolds and provides new tools for studying these complex mathematical objects.
2945	This research paper investigates the thermal decomposition of norbornane dissolved in benzene through experimental study and mechanism investigation. The primary theme of the study is to understand the mechanism of the decomposition reaction and the impact of solvent on the process. The study concludes that the decomposition reaction proceeds via a radical chain mechanism and the solvent benzene plays a significant role in the reaction kinetics and product distribution. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the thermal decomposition of cyclic hydrocarbons and their behavior in solution.
639	We introduce a distributed algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor networks. Our algorithm assumes that nodes in the network only know their immediate neighborhoods and an upper bound on the network's diameter. Clock-synchronization messages are only sent as part of the communication, assumed reasonably frequent, that already takes place among nodes. The algorithm has the gradient property of [2], achieving an O(1) worst-case skew between the logical clocks of neighbors. As in the case of [3,8], the algorithm's actions are such that no constant lower bound exists on the rate at which logical clocks progress in time, and for this reason the lower bound of [2,5] that forbids constant skew between neighbors does not apply.
3171	This research paper focuses on studying the dynamics of size-selected gold nanoparticles using ultrafast electron nanocrystallography. The study examines the structural and electronic properties of the nanoparticles, including their size, shape, and crystal structure. The crucial finding of the research is that the size and shape of the nanoparticles significantly affect their electronic and optical properties. The study concludes that ultrafast electron nanocrystallography is an effective tool for studying the dynamics of nanoparticles and has significant implications for the development of new materials and technologies.
3681	This research paper explores the concept of teleportation and its visualization in popular culture. Teleportation has been a popular theme in science fiction, with depictions ranging from simple matter transportation to more complex scenarios such as time and space travel. This paper examines how visual representations of teleportation have evolved over time, and how they reflect our changing understanding of the concept. It also investigates the impact of these visualizations on public perception and acceptance of teleportation as a potential future technology. Through an analysis of science fiction films, television shows, and literature, this paper aims to provide insights into the role of popular culture in shaping our ideas about technology and its potential applications.
2559	This research paper delves into the thermodynamics of black holes with quantum corrections taken into account to all orders in the Planck length. The study highlights the significance of the Planck length in understanding the behavior of black holes and their thermodynamic properties. The paper establishes that incorporating quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of black holes leads to a modification of the conventional laws of thermodynamics. The critical outcome of this research is the determination of the corrected expressions for the entropy, temperature, and heat capacity of black holes. The conclusions drawn from this study have far-reaching implications for the understanding of black hole thermodynamics, quantum gravity, and the fundamental laws of physics.
920	"This research paper titled ""ASTROD I Charging Simulation and Disturbances"" aims to investigate the charging behavior and disturbances experienced by the ASTROD I spacecraft during its mission. The study uses a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to simulate the charging process and identify any potential sources of disturbances. The results of the simulation show that the spacecraft experiences significant charging during certain mission phases, which can lead to potential interference with sensitive instruments onboard. Additionally, the study identifies the sources of disturbances and provides recommendations for mitigation strategies to improve the reliability of the mission. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the charging behavior and disturbances that can impact spacecraft missions, particularly for long-duration missions like ASTROD I."
364	We present an one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo model for capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The model quantitatively describes the central part of the discharge. For a given voltage and pressure, it self-consistently determines the electric potential and the distribution functions for electrons, negatively charged atomic oxygen, and positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used collision cross sections are critically assessed and in some cases modified. Provided associative detachment due to metastable oxygen molecules is included in the model, the electro-negativities in the center of the discharge are in excellent agreement with experiments. Due to lack of empirical data for the cross section of this process, we propose a simple model and discuss its limitations.
156	"The research paper titled ""Decoherence of Highly Mixed Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions"" discusses the phenomenon of decoherence in macroscopic quantum systems. The paper explores the effect of decoherence on highly mixed macroscopic quantum superpositions and how it leads to the collapse of the quantum state into a classical state. The authors conclude that the decoherence process is irreversible and that the loss of coherence in macroscopic systems is a fundamental limitation of quantum mechanics. The paper highlights the importance of understanding decoherence in macroscopic systems for the development of quantum technologies and the realization of quantum computing. Overall, the paper provides insights into the behavior of macroscopic quantum systems and the challenges faced in harnessing their full potential."
3489	This research paper presents a new discrete computer network model with expanding dimensions. The model captures the growth of a network over time, allowing for the addition of new nodes and edges as the network expands. The model is based on a dynamic graph structure and includes a set of rules for adding new nodes and edges. We conduct experiments to validate the model and demonstrate its ability to capture the dynamics of real-world networks. We also derive a set of theoretical results, including the degree distribution and clustering coefficient, which can be used to analyze the properties of the network as it expands. Our results show that the model accurately captures the behavior of real-world networks, and provides a useful tool for studying the growth and evolution of complex systems.
2740	We study the superconducting state of the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard model using Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory, with the Lanczos method as impurity solver. In the under-doped regime, we find a natural decomposition of the one-particle (photoemission) energy-gap into two components. The gap in the nodal regions, stemming from the anomalous self-energy, decreases with decreasing doping. The antinodal gap has an additional contribution from the normal component of the self-energy, inherited from the normal-state pseudogap, and it increases as the Mott insulating phase is approached.
197	The authors apply three methods of prospective modelling to high resolution georeferenced land cover data in a Mediterranean mountain area: GIS approach, non linear parametric model and neuronal network. Land cover prediction to the latest known date is used to validate the models. In the frame of spatial-temporal dynamics in open systems results are encouraging and comparable. Correct prediction scores are about 73 %. The results analysis focuses on geographic location, land cover categories and parametric distance to reality of the residues. Crossing the three models show the high degree of convergence and a relative similitude of the results obtained by the two statistic approaches compared to the GIS supervised model. Steps under work are the application of the models to other test areas and the identification of respective advantages to develop an integrated model.
930	"The research paper ""Vocabulary growth in collaborative tagging systems"" examines how collaborative tagging systems contribute to the growth of vocabulary. The study analyzed a dataset of tags from Delicious, a social bookmarking platform, and found that new tags were more likely to be created by low-frequency taggers and that the vocabulary growth rate was higher in the early stages of the system's development. The study also found that the use of synonym tags decreased over time, indicating that users were converging on a shared vocabulary. The paper concludes that collaborative tagging systems are effective at facilitating vocabulary growth and can be a valuable resource for language learning and knowledge management."
3001	The critical adsorption point (CAP) of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interacting with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed by Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), that describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer adsorption.
440	This research paper investigates the impact of structural supermodulation on the superconducting gap variations in BSCCO. Through experiments and analysis, the study reveals that the supermodulation induced by oxygen vacancies alters the electronic structure of the material, resulting in a modulation of the superconducting gap. The findings suggest that the structural supermodulation can be effectively utilized to tune and control the superconducting properties of BSCCO, which has significant implications for the development of high-performance superconductors. Overall, this research sheds new light on the interplay between structural and electronic properties in complex materials and provides promising avenues for future research in the field of superconductivity.
777	We formulate a general super duality conjecture on connections between parabolic categories O of modules over Lie superalgebras and Lie algebras of type A, based on a Fock space formalism of their Kazhdan-Lusztig theories which was initiated by Brundan. We show that the Brundan-Kazhdan-Lusztig (BKL) polynomials for Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) in our parabolic setup can be identified with the usual parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. We establish some special cases of the BKL conjecture on the parabolic category O of gl(m|n)-modules and additional results which support the BKL conjecture and super duality conjecture.
174	Surface roughness becomes relevant if typical length scales of the system are comparable to the scale of the variations as it is the case in microfluidic setups. Here, an apparent boundary slip is often detected which can have its origin in the assumption of perfectly smooth boundaries. We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations and introduce an ``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and valleys of the surface. Our simulations show good agreement with analytical results for sinusoidal boundaries, but can be extended to arbitrary geometries and experimentally obtained surface data. We find that the detected apparent slip is independent of the detailed boundary shape, but only given by the distribution of surface heights. Further, we show that the slip diverges as the amplitude of the roughness increases.
3050	"In this topical review I revisit the ""chromospheric flare."" This should currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone, but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems."
2127	"We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass."
2970	We report observation of spin-orbit Berry's phase in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type oscillation of weak field magnetoresistance in an anti-dot lattice (ADL) of a two-dimensional hole system. An AB-type oscillation is superposed on the commensurability peak, and the main peak in the Fourier transform is clearly split up due to variation in Berry's phase originating from the spin-orbit interaction. A simulation considering Berry's phase and the phase arising from the spin-orbit shift in the momentum space shows qualitative agreement with the experiment.
2892	Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities. Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D, to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli exactly equal to seven.
3501	"The research paper ""Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking"" focuses on exploring the effects of D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking scenarios. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the resulting mass spectra for both the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and identifies the regions of parameter space where the D-term contributions are significant. The remarkable finding of the study is that D-term SUSY breaking can significantly alter the mass spectra of the MSSM, leading to non-standard phenomenology that can be probed at future collider experiments. The study concludes that incorporating D-term SUSY breaking in gauge mediation scenarios can lead to a richer and more diverse set of phenomenological signatures that can shed light on the fundamental nature of supersymmetry."
3437	The two dimensional analog of the Hadamard state condition is used to specify the local Hadamard states associated with a linear quantum field coupled to a two dimensional gravitational background. To characterize a local Hadamard state corresponding to a physical vacuum state, we apply a superselection rule in which the state dependent part of the two-point function is determined in terms of a dynamical scalar field. It implies a basic connection between the vacuum state and a scalar field coupled to gravity. We study the characteristics of the Hadamard vacuum state through this superselection rule using two different background metrics, the two dimensional analog of the schwarzschild and FRW metric.
3677	This research paper focuses on the analysis of white dwarf binary systems using the first round Mock LISA Data Challenges datasets. The primary objective is to infer the physical parameters of these systems by performing Bayesian inference on the Mock LISA data. The study uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters, which include the masses, distances, and orbital parameters of the binary systems. The study finds that the Mock LISA data provides significant constraints on the physical parameters of the white dwarf binary systems. The results show that the inferred parameters are consistent with the known physical properties of these systems. The study concludes that the Mock LISA data is a powerful tool for studying white dwarf binary systems and provides valuable insights into their physical properties.
457	We construct SU(2) calorons, with non-trivial holonomy, instanton charge 2 and magnetic charge 0 or -1; these calorons have two constituent monopoles, with charges (2,2) or (2,1). Our calorons are U(1)-symmetric and are constructed via the Nahm transform. They fall into distinct families which can be classified using representation theory. We consider large scale and large period limits of these calorons; in particular, the large scale limit may be a monopole, or a caloron with different topological charges.
1964	Recently H(z) data obtained from differential ages of galaxies have been proposed as a new geometrical probe of dark energy. In this paper we use those data, combined with other background tests (CMB shift and SNIa data), to constrain a set of general relativistic dark energy models together with some other models motivated by extra dimensions. Our analysis rests mostly on Bayesian statistics, and we conclude that LCDM is at least substantially favoured, and that braneworld models are less favoured than general relativistic ones.
852	The relation between the deconfinement and chiral phase transition is explored in the framework of an Polyakov-loop-extended two-flavor quark-meson (PQM) model. In this model the Polyakov loop dynamics is represented by a background temporal gauge field which also couples to the quarks. As a novelty an explicit quark chemical potential and N_f-dependence in the Polyakov loop potential is proposed by using renormalization group arguments. The behavior of the Polyakov loop as well as the chiral condensate as function of temperature and quark chemical potential is obtained by minimizing the grand canonical thermodynamic potential of the system. The effect of the Polyakov loop dynamics on the chiral phase diagram and on several thermodynamic bulk quantities is presented.
3723	We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
3498	We presented a detailed experimental study on lasing in GaAs microstadium with various shapes. Unlike most deformed microcavities, the lasing threshold varies non-monotonically with the major-to-minor-axis ratio of the stadium. Under spatially uniform optical pumping, the first lasing mode corresponds to a high-quality scar mode consisting of several unstable periodic orbits. By tuning the shape of GaAs stadium, we are able to minimize the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates the possibility of controlling chaotic microcavity laser.
2842	This research paper focuses on the many-to-one throughput capacity of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop wireless networks. The authors investigated the impact of node placement, network topology, and routing protocols on the network's capacity. Remarkably, the study found that the network's throughput capacity can be significantly improved through efficient node placement and routing protocols, such as the Opportunistic Routing (OR) protocol. The paper concludes that careful design and optimization of network topology and routing protocols can enhance the many-to-one throughput capacity of multi-hop wireless networks.
2631	We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends upon the solution of an elliptic equation and upon harmonic functions. Starting with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere. Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.
1524	First results of observations of the low mass X-ray binary Her X-1/HZ Her performed by the INTEGRAL satellite in July-August 2005 are presented. A significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a dynamical spin-up/spin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical observations of HZ Her are also discussed.
D2-14	Molecular data on relationships within angiosperms confirm the view that their increasing morphological diversity through the Cretaceous reflected their evolutionary radiation. Despite the early appearance of aquatics and groups with simple flowers, the record is consistent with inferences from molecular trees that the first angiosperms were woody plants with pinnately veined leaves, multiparted flowers, uniovulate ascidiate carpels, and columellar monosulcate pollen. Molecular data appear to refute the hypothesis based on morphology that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living relatives. Morphological analyses of living and fossil seed plants that assume molecular relationships identify glossopterids, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as angiosperm relatives; these results are consistent with proposed homologies between the cupule of glossopterids and Caytonia and the angiosperm bitegmic ovule.
3214	This research paper investigates the angular separation of the components of the Cepheid AW Per, using interferometric measurements taken with the CHARA Array. The main focus is to determine the physical properties of the binary system and to study the pulsation properties of the Cepheid. The paper reports that the angular separation between the two components of the binary system is 2.6 milliarcseconds, and that the Cepheid exhibits a pulsation period of approximately 6.4 days. The findings suggest that AW Per is a promising target for future studies of Cepheid properties and pulsation mechanisms.
1952	Phenomenology of the notion of an unparticle U, recently perceived by Georgi, to describe a scale invariant sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point at a higher energy scale is explored in details. Behaving like a collection of d_U (the scale dimension of the unparticle operator O_U) invisible massless particles, this unparticle can be unveiled by measurements of various energy distributions for the processes Z to fermion pair + U and e-e+ to gamma U at e-e+ colliders, as well as mono-jet production at hadron colliders. We also study the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level process and the one-loop muon anomaly.
2620	"The research paper ""Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic Center"" presents a novel method to identify dark matter burners, which are hypothetical objects that could be responsible for the excess gamma-ray emission observed from the galactic center. Using a combination of simulations and observational data, the authors propose that dark matter burners could be rapidly spinning neutron stars that accrete dark matter and emit gamma rays as a result. They identify several candidate sources in the galactic center that could be dark matter burners and suggest further observations to confirm their hypothesis. The study provides a new avenue for exploring the nature of dark matter and its interactions with other particles."
2278	We propose and experimentally demonstrate non-destructive and noiseless removal (filtering) of vacuum states from an arbitrary set of coherent states of continuous variable systems. Errors i.e. vacuum states in the quantum information are diagnosed through a weak measurement, and on that basis, probabilistically filtered out. We consider three different filters based on on/off detection phase stabilized and phase randomized homodyne detection. We find that on/off etection, optimal in the ideal theoretical setting, is superior to the homodyne strategy in a practical setting.
2770	This research paper investigates Compton scattering of Fe K alpha lines in magnetic cataclysmic variables. The study utilizes observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze the Fe K alpha lines in these systems and determine their scattering properties. The results demonstrate that magnetic cataclysmic variables show a significant amount of Compton scattering, which can affect the observed spectra. This finding has important implications for understanding the physical processes occurring in these systems and interpreting their X-ray emission. The conclusions of this study highlight the need for more detailed modeling of Compton scattering in magnetic cataclysmic variables to accurately interpret X-ray observations.
494	This research paper aims to investigate the growth of networks using the preferential attachment mechanism, focusing on nodes with high indegree and low outdegree. The study explores the impact of preferential attachment on the evolution of networks and how it affects the distribution of node degrees. Through simulations and analysis, the research finds that preferential attachment can lead to the formation of scale-free networks with high indegree and low outdegree nodes. The study also highlights the importance of considering preferential attachment when designing and analyzing complex networks. Overall, the research sheds light on the behavior of network growth and provides insights into the role of preferential attachment in shaping network structure.
554	The Gaussian-Basis Monte Carlo method is a powerful numerical approach for studying the ground states of itinerant and strongly correlated electron systems. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive study of the method and its applications to various systems. We demonstrate that the method can accurately capture the essential physics of the systems, including the formation of complex phases and the emergence of non-trivial excitations. Our results highlight the flexibility and efficiency of the method, making it a valuable tool for investigating a wide range of condensed matter systems. This research paper emphasizes the importance of incorporating advanced numerical techniques into the study of strongly correlated systems.
386	Inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the pseudoscalar mesons of QCD through a dual embedding in a strongly curved extra dimensional spacetime. This model incorporates the consequences of symmetry and has very few free parameters, due to constraints from five-dimensions and the operator product expansion of QCD. Using as inputs the pion, kaon, and rho masses and fpi, we compute the eta and eta prime masses to be 520 and 867 MeV, respectively. Their decay rates into photons are also computed and found to be in good agreement with data.
357	This research paper explores the application of natural priors to the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) fits and investigates their implications for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) weather forecasts. The study uses a Bayesian statistical approach to analyze the compatibility of the CMSSM with the current LHC data. The results indicate that the natural prior on the CMSSM parameters leads to a better fit to the data than the previously used wide priors. Additionally, the study predicts the expected LHC weather forecasts for the next few years, which can help guide future experimental efforts. Overall, the research suggests that the use of natural priors in CMSSM fits can lead to more accurate predictions of particle physics phenomena and improve our understanding of the universe.
3229	"We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a Gr\""obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome."
2984	We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
2226	Direct correlation between temporal structural fluctuations and electron wind force is demonstrated, for the first time, by STM imaging and analysis of atomically-resolved motion on a thin film surface under large applied current (10e5 Amp/sqare cm). The magnitude of the momentum transfer between current carriers and atoms in the fluctuating structure is at least five to fifteen times (plus or minus one sigma range) larger than for freely diffusing adatoms. The corresponding changes in surface resistivity will contribute significant fluctuation signature to nanoscale electronic properties.
3851	This research paper explores non-perturbative conserving approximations in the context of Luttinger's sum rule, which relates the total number of particles in a system to the properties of its collective excitations. The primary theme of the paper is the development of a new, non-perturbative approach to calculating the Luttinger parameter, which characterizes the strength of interactions between particles. The authors find that their method produces results that are in excellent agreement with both numerical simulations and experimental data. Furthermore, they demonstrate that their approach can be used to study the behavior of systems with strong interactions, where perturbative methods break down. Ultimately, the paper concludes that non-perturbative conserving approximations offer a powerful tool for understanding the collective behavior of interacting particle systems.
799	We construct and study a previously defined quantum holographic effective action whose critical equation implies the holographic loop equation of large-N QCD_4 for planar self-avoiding loops in a certain regularization scheme. We extract from the effective action the exact beta function in the given scheme. For the Wilsonean coupling constant the beta function is exacly one loop and the first coefficient agrees with its value in perturbation theory. For the canonical coupling constant the exact beta function has a NSVZ form and the first two coefficients agree with their value in perturbation theory.
1637	In this research paper, we investigate the atom-molecule Rabi oscillations in a Mott insulator using a two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Our primary focus is on understanding the dynamics of the system and the emergence of coherent atom-molecule oscillations. We find that the oscillations are strongly influenced by the interaction strength and the initial state of the system. We also observe a suppression of the oscillations for large interaction strengths. Our findings provide insights into the behavior of atom-molecule systems in a Mott insulator and have important implications for the development of quantum technologies.
D2-61	Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.
1056	This research paper proposes a novel technique for creating a two-color atom guide and a one-dimensional optical lattice using the evanescent fields of high-order transverse modes. The proposed method offers several advantages over existing techniques for atom trapping and manipulation, including increased trapping efficiency, reduced heating, and improved control over the spatial arrangement of the lattice. The paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed method, as well as experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in trapping and manipulating cold atoms. The results of this research have important implications for a wide range of applications in quantum information processing, precision measurement, and fundamental physics research.
3702	This research paper investigates the coincidence of oscillations in the dipole transition and persistent current of narrow quantum rings that contain two electrons. By studying the dependence of the dipole transition and persistent current on the external magnetic field and the width of the ring, we show that the two oscillations occur simultaneously. We find that the frequency of the oscillations increases with the magnetic field, but the amplitude decreases with increasing ring width. Our results provide insight into the intricate interplay between the dipole transition and persistent current in narrow quantum rings, which could have implications for the design of future electronic devices.
3288	This research paper investigates the underlying causes of fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by analyzing the potential energy surface. The fragility of these mixtures is a well-known phenomenon, characterized by a rapid increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature. By exploring the potential energy surface, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics and structural changes that occur in supercooled mixtures. Our results suggest that the fragility of Lennard-Jones mixtures is closely related to the complexity of the potential energy surface, which exhibits a high degree of roughness and heterogeneity. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the behavior of supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in fields such as materials science and chemical engineering.
1670	"The article ""Dissipation in graphene and nanotube resonators"" discusses the study of dissipation (loss of energy) in resonators made of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The authors use a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to investigate the mechanisms of dissipation in these materials. They find that dissipation in graphene resonators is dominated by two-level systems, while dissipation in carbon nanotube resonators is dominated by surface defects. They also show that dissipation can be reduced by using isotopically purified materials and by manipulating the shape and size of the resonators. Overall, the study provides insights into the fundamental physics of dissipation in nanoscale resonators and offers potential strategies for improving their performance in various applications."
133	Near-infrared photometry of transiting extrasolar planets can be of great scientific value. It is however not straightforward to reach the necessary millimagnitude precision. Here we report on our attempts to observe transits and secondary eclipses of several extrasolar planets at 2.2 micron. Best results have been obtained on OGLE-TR-113b using the SOFI near-infrared camera on ESO's New Technology Telescope. Its K-band transit shows a remarkably flat bottom indicating low stellar limb darkening. Secondary eclipse photometry has resulted in a formal 3 sigma detection, but residual systematic effects make this detection rather uncertain.
3042	This research paper explores the jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the accretion and ejection processes in these systems. Using numerical simulations and theoretical models, the study investigates the impact of jet interactions on the X-ray emission and variability. The results reveal that the presence of jets can significantly affect the accretion flow and produce strong X-ray variability. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the jet properties, such as speed and orientation, play a crucial role in determining the X-ray emission characteristics. Overall, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between the accretion and jet processes in massive X-ray binaries and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical efforts to fully understand these systems.
340	This research paper investigates the conditions under which Swing options exhibit bang-bang behavior and proposes strategies for utilizing this property as a basis for trading decisions. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical data, we identify key factors that determine whether a Swing option will exhibit a bang-bang solution. We then explore the practical implications of this property for traders, outlining specific trading strategies that can be implemented to take advantage of this behavior. Our findings have important implications for both academics and practitioners in the field of financial derivatives, providing new insights into the behavior of Swing options and highlighting opportunities for profitable trading strategies.
2521	We study the effect of the kick velocity -- neutron star spin alignment observed in young radio pulsars on the coalescence rate of binary neutron stars. The effect is shown to be especially strong for large kick amplitudes and tight alignments, reducing the galactic rate of binary neutron star coalescences up to an order of magnitude with respect to the rates calculated for random kicks. The spin-kick correlation also leads to much narrower NS spin-orbit misalignments compared to random kicks.
3387	The paper investigates the effects of higher derivative corrections on black hole physics in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The authors use a combination of analytic and numerical techniques to study the behavior of black holes under various conditions, including the presence of scalar fields and magnetic charges. They find that the higher derivative corrections can significantly modify the thermodynamic properties of the black holes, leading to new phenomena such as phase transitions and non-universal behavior. The results have important implications for the holographic correspondence between AdS gravity and conformal field theory, and suggest new avenues for exploring the behavior of black holes in higher dimensions.
3861	The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune that harbors small, icy bodies, known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). In this research paper, we investigate the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Our study shows that KBOs formed through the agglomeration of small particles and grew through mutual collisions. We find that the collisional evolution is highly dependent on the initial size distribution and the strength of the KBOs. Our simulations also suggest that the observed size distribution of KBOs can be explained by the collisional grinding of larger bodies. Our results shed light on the early history of the outer solar system and have implications for the formation of the planets.
3604	Results from a phenomenological analysis for diffractive hadroproduction of heavy flavors at high energies are reported. Diffractive production of charm, bottom and top are calculated using Regge factorization, taking into account recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton density functions in Pomeron by the H1 Collaboration at DESY-HERA. In addition, multiple-Pomeron corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability factor. We give numerical predictions for single diffractive as well as double Pomeron exchange (DPE) cross sections, which agree with the available data for diffractive production of charm and beauty. We make estimates which could be compared to future measurements at the LHC.
3599	This research paper presents a study on the effects of avalanches on the flux injection into the central hole of a superconducting MgB2 ring. The authors utilize a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical simulations to investigate the behavior of the superconductor under different avalanche conditions. The results show that avalanches can significantly enhance the flux injection, leading to a faster recovery of the superconducting state after a magnetic field disturbance. These findings provide important insights into the dynamics of superconducting materials and have potential applications in various fields, including energy storage and transportation.
D1-10	Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are three fundamental principles that describe the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, building on the detailed observations of the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Kepler’s work came at a time when the heliocentric model (Sun-centered solar system) proposed by Copernicus was still controversial. Kepler initially struggled with the Copernican model, but after inheriting Brahe’s precise astronomical data, he was able to make groundbreaking discoveries. Kepler’s first law, the Law of Ellipses, stated that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The second, the Law of Equal Areas, explained that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times.
2690	We generalize the rotationally-invariant formulation of the slave-boson formalism to multiorbital models, with arbitrary interactions, crystal fields, and multiplet structure. This allows for the study of multiplet effects on the nature of low-energy quasiparticles. Non-diagonal components of the matrix of quasiparticle weights can be calculated within this framework. When combined with cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us to address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the superexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We illustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two coupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a two-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).
2542	This research paper investigates the near- and far-infrared counterparts of millimeter dust cores in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D. The study utilizes data from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope to analyze the properties and distribution of dust cores within the cloud. The results show that the majority of the dust cores have a corresponding infrared counterpart, indicating the presence of embedded protostars. The study also suggests that the distribution of these protostars may be influenced by the local environment. These findings contribute to our understanding of star formation in molecular clouds and have important implications for future studies.
838	We study a variational model for a diblock-copolymer/homopolymer blend. The energy functional is a sharp-interface limit of a generalisation of the Ohta-Kawasaki energy. In one dimension, on the real line and on the torus, we prove existence of minimisers of this functional and we describe in complete detail the structure and energy of stationary points. Furthermore we characterise the conditions under which the minimisers may be non-unique. In higher dimensions we construct lower and upper bounds on the energy of minimisers, and explicitly compute the energy of spherically symmetric configurations.
182	The aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a laser in a plasma. At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To solve this huge linear system, one uses a iterative Krylov method with a preconditioning by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightments on the parallel implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture.
2204	"We discuss gravity-like formulations of massive Abelian and non-Abelian gauge field theories in four space-time dimensions with particular emphasis on the issue of gauge invariance. Alternative descriptions in terms of antisymmetric tensor fields and geometric variables, respectively, are analysed. In both approaches St\""uckelberg degrees of freedom factor out. We also demonstrate, in the Abelian case, that the massless limit for the gauge propagator, which does not exist in the vector potential formulation, is well-defined for the antisymmetric tensor fields."
365	"The research paper titled ""Particle-based modeling of oxygen discharges"" presents a computational model for simulating the behavior of oxygen discharges. The authors use a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method to simulate the interactions between charged particles and neutral molecules in an oxygen plasma. The results show that the model accurately predicts the electrical and chemical properties of the plasma, as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma species. The paper also discusses the effects of various parameters, such as the gas pressure and power input, on the plasma behavior. The authors conclude that their model can provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of oxygen plasma discharges, which could have important applications in fields such as materials processing and plasma medicine."
2140	"The research paper titled ""Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588"" focuses on the detection of a high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the properties of the oscillation and its origin. Using data obtained from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, the authors were able to confirm the presence of the oscillation and track its evolution over time. The study provides valuable insights into the physical properties of ultra-compact X-ray binaries and the behavior of the high-frequency oscillations detected in these systems. The outcomes of the study suggest that the observed oscillation is likely due to the accretion process in the binary system."
1161	In this paper we derive 4-dimensional General Relativity from three dimensions, using the intrinsic spatial geometry inherent in Yang--Mills theory which has been exposed by previous authors as well as as some properties of the Ashtekar variables. We provide various interesting relations, including the fact that General Relativity can be written as a Yang--Mills theory where the antiself-dual Weyl curvature replaces the Yang--Mills coupling constant. We have generalized the results of some previous authors, covering Einsteins spaces, to include more general spacetime geometries.
2821	Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.
3187	This research paper investigates the transient dynamics of Hopfield neural networks with sparsely connected nodes and arbitrary degree distributions. The study explores the impact of network topology on the network dynamics and identifies critical points where the network undergoes a phase transition. The research findings suggest that networks with higher degree distributions exhibit more stable and robust dynamics. The study contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of sparsely connected neural networks and highlights the importance of network topology in determining the network's performance.
1610	Coupled-mode systems are used in physical literature to simplify the nonlinear Maxwell and Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a small periodic potential and to approximate localized solutions called gap solitons by analytical expressions involving hyperbolic functions. We justify the use of the one-dimensional stationary coupled-mode system for a relevant elliptic problem by employing the method of Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions in Fourier space. In particular, existence of periodic/anti-periodic and decaying solutions is proved and the error terms are controlled in suitable norms. The use of multi-dimensional stationary coupled-mode systems is justified for analysis of bifurcations of periodic/anti-periodic solutions in a small multi-dimensional periodic potential.
2692	It was recently shown by Hansen that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is, for general states of quantum systems, not subadditive with respect to decomposition into two subsystems, although this property is known to hold for pure states. We investigate the question whether the weaker property of subadditivity for pure states with respect to decomposition into more than two subsystems holds. This property would have interesting applications in quantum chemistry. We show, however, that it does not hold in general, and provide a counterexample.
887	This research paper explores the atmospheric dynamics of short-period extra solar gas giant planets, specifically investigating the dependence of night-side temperature on opacity. Using computer simulations, the researchers found that the night-side temperature of these planets is heavily influenced by the opacity of their atmospheres. They also discovered that the circulation patterns on these planets are strongly impacted by the location and strength of their atmospheric jets. These findings have important implications for future studies of exoplanets and our understanding of planetary atmospheric dynamics.
D2-22	Insects can be used for food production and are already consumed in many cultures worldwide. They are a nutritious, sustainable, and environmentally friendly protein source. Edible insects such as crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, and black soldier fly larvae are rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals like iron and zinc. Compared to traditional livestock, insect farming requires less land, water, and feed, while producing lower greenhouse gas emissions. Insects can be used in whole form, ground into flours for protein bars, pasta, or baked goods, or processed into animal feed. While cultural barriers exist in some regions, the growing interest in sustainable food sources is driving research and commercial production of edible insects globally.
1077	We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived a graded refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the light deflection in a gravitational field can be calculated correctly with the use of this refractive index and therefore the gravitational lensing can be treated conveniently with the optical method. For illustration, we simulated the imaging of gravitational lensing, figured out the time delay between the two images and calculated the lens mass in a conventional optical way.
583	The paper investigates the relationship between the average word length of elements in a surface group and the size of the characteristic generating set. The authors prove that for a surface group with a fixed genus and number of boundary components, the average word length tends to infinity as the size of the generating set grows. They also provide a lower bound on the rate of growth of the average word length. These results have implications for the study of algorithmic complexity and the geometry of surface groups.
3348	This research paper focuses on the comparison of the radio luminosities of solitary and binary millisecond pulsars, with a specific focus on PSR J1453+1902. The study found that binary pulsars have higher radio luminosities than solitary pulsars, which may be attributed to the interaction between the pulsar and its companion star. Additionally, the analysis of PSR J1453+1902 revealed that it has a relatively low radio luminosity compared to other binary pulsars, suggesting that it may have a unique evolutionary history. Overall, the study sheds light on the relationship between pulsar evolution and radio luminosity, and provides insights into the properties of PSR J1453+1902.
1832	"The research paper ""Trapping and Cooling a Mirror to its Quantum Mechanical Ground State"" discusses the experimental achievement of cooling a macroscopic mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state. The researchers used a cavity optomechanical system to trap and cool a mirror in a high-finesse optical cavity, allowing them to observe the quantum behavior of the mirror's motion. The experiment demonstrated the ability to prepare a macroscopic object in its lowest energy state, which has potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement. The paper concludes that this achievement opens up new possibilities for exploring the boundary between classical and quantum physics in macroscopic systems."
1486	Light and cold extrasolar planets such as OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, a 5.5 Earth-mass planet detected via microlensing, could be frequent in the Galaxy according to some preliminary results from microlensing experiments. These planets can be frozen rocky- or ocean-planets, situated beyond the snow line and, therefore, beyond the habitable zone of their system. They can nonetheless host a layer of liquid water, heated by radiogenic energy, underneath an ice shell surface for billions of years, before freezing completely. These results suggest that oceans under ice, like those suspected to be present on icy moons in the Solar system, could be a common feature of cold low-mass extrasolar planets.
1329	This research paper focuses on the analytic index for proper, Lie groupoid actions. The authors introduce a new definition of the index and establish its properties. They also investigate the relationship between the analytic index and the topological index. The remarkable finding of this paper is the construction of a formula for the analytic index in terms of the topological index, which provides a powerful tool for studying the index in various contexts. The authors conclude by demonstrating the usefulness of this formula in several concrete examples.
339	In this paper we investigate a class of swing options with firm constraints in view of the modeling of supply agreements. We show, for a fully general payoff process, that the premium, solution to a stochastic control problem, is concave and piecewise affine as a function of the global constraints of the contract. The existence of bang-bang optimal controls is established for a set of constraints which generates by affinity the whole premium function. When the payoff process is driven by an underlying Markov process, we propose a quantization based recursive backward procedure to price these contracts. A priori error bounds are established, uniformly with respect to the global constraints.
770	This research paper focuses on the problem of detecting and identifying an unobservable change in the distribution of a random sequence. The joint detection and identification of such a change presents a challenging task due to the lack of prior information on the nature and timing of the change. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem using a Bayesian framework. We provide theoretical analysis and simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting and identifying the change points. Our findings have implications for various applications, such as signal processing and anomaly detection, where the ability to detect and identify changes in data distributions is critical.
320	This research paper focuses on SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2, a white dwarf star with a gaseous debris disc. The main objective of the study was to analyze the properties of the disc and understand its formation. The authors used various observational techniques, including spectroscopy and imaging, to study the system. The crucial finding of the study was the detection of a second white dwarf with a gaseous debris disc, which suggests that such systems may be more common than previously thought. The study also provides insight into the evolution of planetary systems and the fate of their debris after the star dies.
1233	A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of a U(1) symmetry, this kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, similar to recently studied Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal nonlinear extension of quantum theory. A probabilistic interpretation (Born's rule) holds, provided the underlying model is scale free. Keywords: nonlinear functional Schroedinger equation, gauge symmetry, Newtonian gravity.
1799	A spectroscopic method for staggered fermions based on thermodynamical considerations is proposed. The canonical partition functions corresponding to the different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit as polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the zero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is successfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched results are presented showing good agreement with that of standard spectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon and dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations are practically unreachable.
1334	The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.
488	This research paper presents the direct measurement of the radius and density of the transiting exoplanet HD 189733B using the CHARA Array. The main focus of the study is to accurately determine the physical properties of the exoplanet, which can provide valuable insights into its composition and formation. The crucial findings of the research indicate that the exoplanet has a radius of 1.138   0.046 times that of Jupiter and a density of 0.75   0.16 g/cm . These results suggest that the exoplanet has a predominantly gaseous composition with a small rocky core. The study highlights the importance of direct measurements in understanding the properties of transiting exoplanets and provides a new method for future exoplanet research.
1865	Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for a micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit. A Lorentz force, generated by the passive back-action of the resonator's displacement, can cool down the thermal motion of the mechanical resonator by applying an appropriate microwave drive to the qubit. We show that this onchip cooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response time of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible experimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be cooled down by several orders of magnitude.
3506	We investigate the lasing modes in fully chaotic polymer microstadiums under optical pumping. The lasing modes are regularly spaced in frequency, and their amplitudes oscillate with frequency. Our numerical simulations reveal that the lasing modes are multi-orbit scar modes. The interference of partial waves propagating along the constituent orbits results in local maxima of quality factor at certain frequencies. The observed modulation of lasing mode amplitude with frequency results from the variation of quality factor, which provides the direct evidence of wave interference effect in open chaotic microcavities.
2083	This research paper investigates the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions, specifically the distribution of particles produced in the collision and their correlation with the orientation of the collision. Using experimental data from high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, we analyze the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production and identify various effects that contribute to the observed patterns. Our results suggest that the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions is a powerful tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter that existed in the early universe. Ultimately, this research contributes to our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and has implications for the study of heavy-ion collisions in astrophysics and cosmology.
1661	We present the results of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for 18 elements in 31 nearby stars with planets. The resulting abundances are combined with other similar studies of nearby stars with planets and compared to a sample of nearby stars without detected planets. We find some evidence for abundance differences between these two samples for Al, Si and Ti. Some of our results are in conflict with a recent study of stars with planets in the SPOCS database. We encourage continued study of the abundance patterns of stars with planets to resolve these discrepancies.
2910	The Mathematical Universe is a concept that suggests that mathematics is not just a human invention, but a fundamental aspect of the universe itself. This paper explores the idea that the universe is inherently mathematical, and that all physical phenomena can be explained through mathematical laws and principles. Through an analysis of various theories and observations, it is concluded that mathematics is indeed a universal language that can describe the fundamental nature of the universe. The implications of this idea are far-reaching, as it suggests that mathematics can be used to predict and understand phenomena that were previously thought to be beyond our comprehension. Ultimately, this paper argues that the Mathematical Universe is a powerful and compelling idea that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.
2097	This research paper presents a theoretical model for the field emission current fluctuation in carbon nanotube thin films. The model considers the effects of inter-tube interactions, the spatial distribution of tube lengths, and the stochastic nature of electron emission. The results show that the current fluctuation is strongly influenced by the inter-tube interactions and the distribution of tube lengths. The model predicts that the current fluctuation can be reduced by increasing the average tube length and decreasing the inter-tube distance. The study also found that the current fluctuation is sensitive to the applied electric field and the temperature of the device. Overall, the proposed model provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of field emission current fluctuation in carbon nanotube thin films, which can be useful in designing and optimizing field emission devices for various applications.
3468	Nuclear medicine (NM) images inherently suffer from large amounts of noise and blur. The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM images.

1656	"Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual lenses to characterize what is important in mathematics. Originally the main lenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our focus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory is laid by first showing that the object-to-object ""heteromorphisms"" between the objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to group map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic theory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the heteromorphisms between the objects of different categories."
3746	This research paper investigates the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and star formation in the host galaxy of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf quasar.

The results also suggest that the Cloverleaf quasar s host galaxy is undergoing a phase of intense star formation, which is likely triggered by mergers or interactions with neighboring galaxies. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between quasar activity and star formation in distant galaxies.
D2-95	Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. PET is a common imaging technique, a medical scintillography technique used in nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical – a radioisotope attached to a drug – is injected into the body as a tracer. When the radiopharmaceutical undergoes beta plus decay, a positron is emitted, and when the positron interacts with an ordinary electron, the two particles annihilate and two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.

2564	There is a huge amount of historical documents in libraries and in various National Archives that have not been exploited electronically. Although automatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term objective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication and extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to aging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open research field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing methods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of historical interest.
3074	This research paper presents an empirical analysis and statistical modeling of attack processes based on honeypots. The study involved collecting data from honeypots deployed in a production network environment and analyzing the observed attack patterns. The authors developed a statistical model to describe the attack processes and used it to simulate different attack scenarios. The study found that the most common attack methods were brute-force attacks, port scanning, and web application attacks. The authors also found that attackers tend to target specific vulnerabilities and that the majority of attacks come from a small number of IP addresses. The statistical model developed in the study can be used to predict the likelihood of different types of attacks and can assist in the development of effective countermeasures.
3514	We obtain a system of exact solutions of the Dirac equation for an electron moving in a constant homogeneous external magnetic field with account of its vacuum magnetic moment and assumed Lorentz invariance violation in the minimal CPT-odd form in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Using these solutions, characteristics of the particle synchrotron radiation are calculated, and possible observable effects caused by the Lorentz non-invariant interaction are described. We demonstrate that the angular distribution of the radiation has specific asymmetry, which can be explained as a consequence of non-conservation of transversal electron polarization in the presence of a background Lorentz non-invariant condensate field.

The outcomes of the study demonstrate that the optimal noise distribution for SSR is dependent on the input signal frequency, and that the optimal stimulus distribution is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The study concludes that SSR can significantly enhance information transmission, particularly in the presence of noise, and that the optimal noise and stimulus distributions can be determined by the signal characteristics and system parameters.
7	This research paper delves into the area of algebraic topology, where we investigate the relationship between link concordance, homology cobordism, and Hirzebruch-type defects. We explore this relationship through the study of iterated p-covers and their associated groups. Our findings reveal a connection between these structures, with significant implications for our understanding of knot theory and the classification of 4-manifolds. Specifically, we show that the existence of Hirzebruch-type defects in iterated p-covers implies the non-triviality of link concordance classes, and we establish a new criterion for homology cobordism. Our research provides new insights into the interplay between topological invariants, paving the way for further exploration in this area.
1480	In this paper non-group permutation modulated sequences for the Gaussian channel are considered. Without the restriction to group codes rather than subsets of group codes, arbitrary rates are achievable. The code construction utilizes the known optimal group constellations to ensure at least the same performance but exploit the Gray code ordering structure of multiset permutations as a selection criterion at the decoder. The decoder achieves near maximum likelihood performance at low computational cost and low additional memory requirements at the receiver.
1176	We construct analytic solutions for marginal deformations satisfying the reality condition in open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits when operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated superconformal primary field are regular. Our strategy is based on the recent observation by Erler that the problem of finding solutions for marginal deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality condition by construction.

The results also revealed a correlation between the cluster radius and the host galaxy's properties, such as the star formation rate and gas density. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of star clusters in M51.
1000	"We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff of coherent time, frequency and time-frequency selective-fading MIMO channels and provide a code design criterion for DM-tradeoff optimality. Our results are based on the analysis of the ""Jensen channel"" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO channel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the mutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff and lends itself nicely to analytical treatment. Finally, as a consequence of our results, we find that the classical rank criterion for space-time code design (in selective-fading MIMO channels) ensures optimality in the sense of the DM-tradeoff."
2058	This research paper revisits the Fischler-Susskind holographic cosmology model, which suggests that the universe's evolution can be described as a hologram projected from its boundary.

However, they also identify some limitations of the model, such as its inability to explain the origin of the holographic principle. Overall, the paper contributes to our understanding of the holographic universe hypothesis and its implications for cosmology.

These findings provide valuable insights into the structural properties of Fibonacci chains and can contribute to the development of new materials with unique properties.
1849	We study five-dimensional black holes obtained by compactifying M theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Recent progress in solving topological string theory on compact, one-parameter models allows us to test numerically various conjectures about these black holes. We give convincing evidence that a microscopic description based on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants accounts correctly for their macroscopic entropy, and we check that highly nontrivial cancellations -which seem necessary to resolve the so-called entropy enigma in the OSV conjecture- do in fact occur. We also study analytically small 5d black holes obtained by wrapping M2 branes in the fiber of K3 fibrations. By using heterotic/type II duality we obtain exact formulae for the microscopic degeneracies in various geometries, and we compute their asymptotic expansion for large charges.

2305	Critical behavior of the Ising model is investigated at the center of large scale finite size systems, where the lattice is represented as the tiling of pentagons. The system is on the hyperbolic plane, and the recursive structure of the lattice makes it possible to apply the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. From the calculated nearest neighbor spin correlation function and the spontaneous magnetization, it is concluded that the phase transition of this model is mean-field like. One parameter deformation of the corner Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic plane is discussed.
3445	"We show the asymptotic long-time equivalence of a generic power law waiting time distribution to the Mittag-Leffler waiting time distribution, characteristic for a time fractional CTRW. This asymptotic equivalence is effected by a combination of ""rescaling"" time and ""respeeding"" the relevant renewal process followed by a passage to a limit for which we need a suitable relation between the parameters of rescaling and respeeding. Turning our attention to spatially 1-D CTRWs with a generic power law jump distribution, ""rescaling"" space can be interpreted as a second kind of ""respeeding"" which then, again under a proper relation between the relevant parameters leads in the limit to the space-time fractional diffusion equation. Finally, we treat the `time fractional drift"" process as a properly scaled limit of the counting number of a Mittag-Leffler renewal process."

Results indicate that individuals can learn to bluff more effectively over time and that this skill can be improved through feedback and practice. This research has important implications for understanding social cognition and improving interpersonal communication skills. By better understanding the process of learning to bluff, individuals may be able to improve their ability to navigate complex social situations and improve their overall social competence.

In addition, quantum dot can be realized regardless of substrate induced static disorder or irregular edges of the junction. This device can be used to easily design quantum dot devices. This platform can also be used to design zero-dimensional functional nanoscale electronic devices using graphene ribbons.

D2-2	Spermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood.
3852	We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.

The paper concludes that smectic elastomer membranes have potential applications in various fields, including soft robotics and biomedical devices, due to their tunable mechanical properties and responsiveness to external stimuli."
D2-35	"Einstein and Schrödinger exchanged significant ideas throughout their careers. Both physicists shared deep skepticism about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, maintaining a correspondence that revealed their mutual discomfort with quantum indeterminism. Einstein's famous quote, ""God does not play dice with the universe,"" echoed Schrödinger's own reservations. Their intellectual relationship flourished through letters and occasional meetings, where they discussed unified field theory and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment partially emerged from these discussions, attempting to illustrate what both considered absurdities in quantum theory. Though they never resolved their concerns about quantum mechanics, their dialogue represented one of the most profound scientific exchanges of the 20th century, challenging mainstream quantum interpretations while searching for deeper truths."

123	We study a novel configuration for displacement detection consisting of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to both, a radio frequency superconducting interference device (RF SQUID) and to a superconducting stripline resonator. We employ an adiabatic approximation and rotating wave approximation and calculate the displacement sensitivity. We study the performance of such a displacement detector when the stripline resonator is driven into a region of nonlinear oscillations. In this region the system exhibits noise squeezing in the output signal when homodyne detection is employed for readout. We show that displacement sensitivity of the device in this region may exceed the upper bound imposed upon the sensitivity when operating in the linear region. On the other hand, we find that the high displacement sensitivity is accompanied by a slowing down of the response of the system, resulting in a limited bandwidth.

The study concludes that geometry plays a crucial role in asymmetric diffusion and provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transport of particles in confined environments.
3293	We study a simple geometric model of transportation facility that consists of two points between which the travel speed is high. This elementary definition can model shuttle services, tunnels, bridges, teleportation devices, escalators or moving walkways. The travel time between a pair of points is defined as a time distance, in such a way that a customer uses the transportation facility only if it is helpful. We give algorithms for finding the optimal location of such a transportation facility, where optimality is defined with respect to the maximum travel time between two points in a given set.
2570	Simple geometrical considerations show that the collision zone in high energy nuclear collisions may be divided into a central part (``core''), with high energy densities, and a peripheral part (``corona''), with smaller energy densities, more like in pp or pA collisions. We present calculations which allow to separate these two contributions, and which show that the corona contribution is quite small (but not negligible) for central collisions, but gets increasingly important with decreasing centrality. We will discuss consequences concerning results obtained in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

The study concludes that the scattering contribution should be carefully considered in the design and optimization of X-ray telescopes to improve their imaging performance.
3829	We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
2881	This research paper focuses on the pseudogap phase of cuprates and the use of X-ray dichroism to study it. The central focus is on understanding the electronic properties of the pseudogap phase and how they relate to the superconducting state. The paper presents important outcomes such as the discovery of a dichroic effect that is sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the crystal axis. The conclusions suggest that X-ray dichroism can provide valuable insights into the pseudogap phase and its relationship to superconductivity in cuprates.
2071	For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner part of the disk is expected to make a transition from advection dominance to neutrino cooling. This transition is characterized by sharp changes of the disk properties. I argue here that during this transition, a modest increase of the accretion rate leads to powerful enhancement of the Poynting luminosity of the GRB flow and decrease of its baryon loading. These changes of the characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon energy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.
1597	This research paper focuses on the van der Waals-like phase separation instability of a driven granular gas in three dimensions. The primary focus is on the behavior of the granular gas in the presence of external driving and how it affects the phase separation behavior. The study utilizes numerical simulations and analytical calculations to investigate the instability and its dependence on various parameters. The important outcomes of the study include the identification of a critical driving strength that triggers the instability, the discovery of a scaling relation between the driving strength and the characteristic length scale of the instability, and the observation of a transition from a continuous to a discontinuous phase separation. These findings provide insights into the fundamental physics of granular gases and may have practical implications for various engineering applications.
1893	This research paper investigates the impact of stellar-mass black holes on the structural evolution of massive star clusters. Using computer simulations, we examine the effects of black hole formation and subsequent interactions on the overall dynamics and morphology of the cluster. Our results show that the presence of black holes can lead to the formation of a central density cusp and an extended halo, as well as the ejection of stars from the cluster. We also find evidence for the formation of binary black holes, which could have significant implications for the production of gravitational waves. Overall, our study sheds light on the complex interplay between black holes and star clusters, and has important implications for our understanding of galactic formation and evolution.
3070	This research paper presents a study on the relationship between the transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant, and energy on locally compact spaces. The main objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of these three quantities under different conditions and to establish their interdependence. The research findings suggest that the transfinite diameter and Chebyshev constant are closely related, with the latter being an upper bound for the former. Additionally, the energy of a locally compact space was found to be directly proportional to the square of the Chebyshev constant. These results have important implications in the field of mathematical analysis and can be used to derive new theorems and formulas for various applications.
3360	This research paper explores the concept of inflated beta distributions, which are probability distributions that have an excess of observations at either end of the distribution. The main focus of the study is to provide a comprehensive overview of inflated beta distributions and their properties, including moments, skewness, and kurtosis. The paper also examines the application of inflated beta distributions in modeling empirical data, such as financial returns and the likelihood of extreme events. The crucial finding of this study is that inflated beta distributions are useful for modeling data with heavy tails and provide a better fit than traditional beta distributions. The conclusion of the paper is that inflated beta distributions offer a flexible and powerful tool for modeling complex data and should be considered by researchers and practitioners in various fields.
2297	This paper aims to explore the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system, which has been a longstanding challenge in quantum mechanics. The measurement process in quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical mechanics, and the problem of how to reconcile the two has been subject to much debate. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the measurement process in a two-level quantum system, including the role of the wave function collapse and the various interpretations of quantum mechanics. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the measurement problem for the broader field of quantum information and computing. Through a comprehensive examination of the measurement problem in a two-level quantum system, this paper provides insights into the nature of quantum mechanics and how it differs from classical mechanics, and offers potential solutions for reconciling the two.
1567	We investigate the dielectrophoretic motion of charge-neutral, polarizable nanocolloids through molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison to analytical results derived for continuum systems shows that the discrete charge distributions on the nanocolloids have a significant impact on their coupling to the external field. Aggregation of nanocolloids leads to enhanced dielectrophoretic transport, provided that increase in the dipole moment upon aggregation can overcome the related increase in friction. The dimer orientation and the exact structure of the nanocolloid charge distribution are shown to be important in the enhanced transport.
2074	"We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The notion of ""relational"" is the common denominator of two views. We have approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a possible structure of physical reality?"
1214	The research paper proposes a new approach to Gaussian layered broadcast coding with successive refinement that aims to minimize expected distortion. The approach involves creating a layered structure with multiple encoding layers, where each layer provides additional refinement to the previously encoded layers. The authors derive an expression for the minimum expected distortion achievable using this approach and show that it is achievable through a practical coding scheme. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms them in terms of expected distortion. The main conclusion of the paper is that the proposed approach provides an effective method for achieving high-quality broadcast coding with successive refinement.
905	"The research paper ""Milnor Invariants for Spatial Graphs"" explores the concept of Milnor invariants for spatial graphs, which are graphs embedded in three-dimensional space. The paper presents a method for computing the Milnor invariants of spatial graphs using the Jones polynomial, a well-known invariant in knot theory.

The paper concludes that the Milnor invariants provide a powerful tool for distinguishing between non-isomorphic spatial graphs and may have applications in areas such as materials science and computer science."
154	This research paper investigates the scalar wave equation in a non-commutative spherically symmetric space-time. The study examines the impact of non-commutativity on the propagation of scalar waves and the dynamics of physical systems. The critical outcomes of the research reveal that non-commutativity introduces new features in the wave equation and modifies the solutions in the spherically symmetric space-time. The findings suggest that non-commutativity has significant consequences for the interpretation of physical phenomena and the formulation of theories in quantum field theory and general relativity. The research provides a framework for future investigations into the effects of non-commutativity on various physical systems and highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the dynamics of non-commutative space-times.
874	"A detailed analysis of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in spacelike Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory is presented. A semiclassical treatment reproduces the leading terms of the tree-level result from quantum field theory. Moreover, certain quantum corrections turn out to be suppressed for large energies of the charged particle, for example, the quantum corrections to the classical MCS Cherenkov angle. It is argued that MCS-theory Cherenkov radiation may, in principle, lead to anisotropy effects for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In addition, a qualitative discussion of vacuum Cherenkov radiation from a modified-Maxwell term in the action is given, together with UHECR bounds on some of its dimensionless ""coupling constants."""

The results indicate that the proposed methodology achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost and provides accurate solutions for the optimal shape design problem. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering minimax differentiability in the design optimization process for Stokes flow systems. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the optimal shape design for Stokes flow and offers a promising approach for future research in fluid mechanics and optimization.
1505	This research paper aims to provide a possible explanation as to why the Theta+ baryon has been observed in some experiments and not in others. The Theta+ is a short-lived particle that has been the subject of much interest in the field of particle physics. While some experiments have reported the observation of the Theta+, others have failed to detect it. This paper proposes that the different results may be due to the different experimental conditions used in each study, such as the energy of the particles used to produce the Theta+ and the detection methods employed. The paper also discusses the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter. Finally, the paper concludes by suggesting avenues for future research on the Theta+ and other particles in the field of particle physics.
3444	This research paper investigates the sources of errors in two-port network analyzer measurements and their impact on the accuracy of total differential measurements. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the differential measurement errors arising from imperfect matching, non-ideal cable transmission, and phase errors. The results indicate that the total differential errors in two-port network analyzer measurements are significant and can adversely affect the accuracy of measurements. The paper concludes with recommendations for minimizing these errors to improve the accuracy of two-port network analyzer measurements for total differential measurements.
1584	Charge redistribution at interfaces is crucial for electronic applications of high-Tc superconductors, since the band structure is modified on a local scale. We address the normal-state electronic structure of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) at an YBCO-metal contact by first principles calculations for prototypical interface configurations. We derive quantitative results for the intrinsic doping of the superconducting CuO2 planes due to the metal contact. Our findings can be explained in terms of a band-bending mechanism, complemented by local screening effects. We determine a net charge transfer of 0.09 to 0.13 electrons in favour of the intraplane Cu sites, depending on the interface orientation.
1375	"The recent developments of the phase string theory for doped antiferromagnets will be briefly reviewed. Such theory is built upon a singular phase string effect induced by the motion of holes in a doped antiferromagnet, which as a precise property of the t-J model dictates the novel competition between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. A global phase diagram including the antiferromagnetic, superconducting, lower and upper pseudogap, and high-temperature ""normal"" phases, as well as a series of anomalous physical properties of these phases will be presented as the self-consistent and systematic consequences of the phase string theory."
2989	This research paper aims to quantify the evolution of social groups. The study is based on analyzing data from various social networks and online communities. The research uses network analysis and statistical modeling to identify the factors that contribute to the growth and decline of social groups over time. The critical outcomes of the research indicate that the size of a group, the frequency of interactions, and the diversity of members play a crucial role in the evolution of social groups. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering these factors when designing social networks and online communities. The conclusions of the research suggest that by understanding the evolution of social groups, we can create more effective social networks and communities that foster engagement and growth.
1371	We report the observation of a compensation point in the temperature dependence of magnetization data of polycrystalline Sm2Al. Magnetization measurements show that this compound magnetically orders at about 150 K. Below this temperature, the magnetization data shows a compensation point, which shifts with field. Hysteresis loops obtained below the compensation temperature show that the compound possesses exchange anisotropy. Both the exchange anisotropy field and the coercive field are found to be quite large and comparable to those of the classical spin-orbit compensated ferromagnet (Sm,Gd)Al2. The heat capacity data also suggest that there are similarities between (Sm,Gd)Al2 and Sm2Al.
1522	The classical Ehresmann-Bruhat order describes the possible degenerations of a pair of flags in a finite-dimensional vector space V; or, equivalently, the closure of an orbit of the group GL(V) acting on the direct product of two full flag varieties. We obtain a similar result for triples consisting of two subspaces and a partial flag in V; this is equivalent to describing the closure of a GL(V)-orbit in the product of two Grassmannians and one flag variety. We give a rank criterion to check whether such a triple can be degenerated to another one, and we classify the minimal degenerations. Our methods involve only elementary linear algebra and combinatorics of graphs (originating in Auslander-Reiten quivers).
1994	This research paper explores the linkage between accretion disks and blazars, focusing on the primary theme of understanding the emission mechanisms of these astrophysical objects. The study utilized multi-wavelength observations and numerical simulations to investigate the physical processes involved in the accretion disk and jet formation, as well as the mechanisms that contribute to the observed variability in blazar emission. The findings suggest that the accretion disk plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of blazars, and that the jet launch and collimation are intimately linked to the disk structure and dynamics. The study highlights the importance of a comprehensive understanding of accretion disk physics for interpreting the observations of blazars and other active galactic nuclei.
3286	This research paper aims at understanding the fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by investigating the locally preferred structures. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structural and dynamical properties of the mixtures. The results show that the mixtures exhibit fragility, which is attributed to the formation of locally preferred structures that impede the mobility of the molecules. The study also reveals that the fragility is strongly correlated with the degree of structural ordering and the size of the locally preferred structures. These findings provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fragility in supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in materials science and industrial processes.
1104	"The article ""Transverse LS-Category for Riemannian Foliations"" focuses on the study of Riemannian foliations, which are a type of geometric structure that can be used to describe certain types of smooth manifolds. The article introduces a new concept called the transverse LS-category, which is a measure of the complexity of the foliation in terms of the topology of the transverse space. The article provides several results and examples of how the transverse LS-category can be used to understand the structure of Riemannian foliations. Noteworthy outcomes include the development of new tools for studying Riemannian foliations, and the identification of new classes of foliations with interesting geometric properties. Overall, the article contributes to the field of differential geometry and provides a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of Riemannian foliations."
20	The influence of a weak random potential on the collective modes of a trapped interacting Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature is calculated in the limit when the correlation length of the disorder is smaller than the healing length of the superfluid. The problem is solved in the Thomas-Fermi limit by generalizing the superfluid hydrodynamic equations to allow for the presence of weak disorder. We find that the disorder-induced frequency-shifts of the low-energy excitations can be of the same order of magnitude as the beyond mean-field corrections in the normal interaction recently observed experimentally.
3973	"The research paper ""Modelling the Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiant-dominated Populations"" focuses on the study of red supergiant stars and their impact on the near-infrared spectra of their host galaxies. The authors developed a theoretical model that takes into account the contribution of red supergiants to the spectra of their host galaxies. They found that red supergiants play a significant role in shaping the near-infrared spectra of galaxies, and their contribution increases with increasing metallicity. The study concludes that red supergiants are important probes for understanding the properties of their host galaxies and can provide valuable insights into the star formation history and chemical evolution of these systems."
1054	This research paper explores the potential existence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and their implications for particle physics. The Lee-Wick model predicts the existence of a tower of excited states for each gauge boson, which could explain some of the observed anomalies in current experimental data. We present a detailed analysis of the LHC data, focusing on the search for resonant peaks in the invariant mass distribution of the final state particles. We find no evidence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons in the current data, placing stringent limits on the model parameters. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of new physics models beyond the Standard Model.
855	The paper presents observations of a young star with an unusual morphological structure resembling a diamond ring. The observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which allowed for high-resolution imaging of the object. The authors suggest that the unusual morphology may be due to the presence of multiple protostars in a tight orbit around each other, or the presence of a disk of material around a single protostar. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of multiple star systems.
3831	A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.
192	We investigate the relation between the scaling of block entropies and the efficient simulability by Matrix Product States (MPS), and clarify the connection both for von Neumann and Renyi entropies (see Table I). Most notably, even states obeying a strict area law for the von Neumann entropy are not necessarily approximable by MPS. We apply these results to illustrate that quantum computers might outperform classical computers in simulating the time evolution of quantum systems, even for completely translational invariant systems subject to a time independent Hamiltonian.
D2-88	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s Hydrogéologie (1802) proposed a holistic, steady-state geological model emphasizing uniformitarianism—the idea that gradual processes shape Earth’s surface over immense time. He theorized that continents erode eastward, with debris deposited westward via global currents, causing a slow continental migration. Lamarck integrated living organisms into Earth’s dynamics, arguing their metabolic activity drives the decomposition and recycling of materials, sustaining planetary equilibrium. This vision positioned biology as central to geology, pioneering ecological thinking by linking abiotic and biotic processes. However, his speculative approach—rooted in outdated four-element chemistry—drew criticism from contemporaries like Georges Cuvier and Antoine Lavoisier. Despite its flaws, Hydrogéologie laid groundwork for synthesizing Earth sciences, envisioning a unified “Physique terrestre” (terrestrial physics) combining meteorology, hydrogeology, and biology
373	Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe in graphene, at energies close to the Dirac point, is analyzed. It is shown that, in clean systems, the orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed, due to the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. In the presence of preexisting localized states at the Dirac energy, the orthogonality catastrophe shows similar features to those found in normal metals with a finite density of states at the Fermi level. The implications for the Kondo effect induced by magnetic impurities, and for the Fermi edge singularities in tunneling processes are also discussed.
3983	In this study, the photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts was investigated. The researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope to measure the conductance of individual molecules, and then exposed them to light to observe any changes in conductance. They found that some molecules exhibited photoconductance, meaning their conductance increased when exposed to light. The researchers also discovered that the photoconductance was dependent on the type of molecule and the intensity of the light. These findings suggest that organic single-molecule contacts have potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
3081	This research paper focuses on studying the higher ramification properties of secant divisors on generic curves. The primary focus is to understand the behavior of such divisors and to investigate their geometric properties. The paper presents several remarkable findings, including the proof of a conjecture on the multiplicities of certain secant divisors and the construction of new families of curves with interesting secant divisor properties. The conclusions drawn from this research provide a deeper understanding of the geometry of generic curves and their secant divisors.
3773	Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.
374	This research paper explores the complex behavior of electrons in graphene, specifically focusing on the interplay between the orthogonality catastrophe and the Kondo effect. The orthogonality catastrophe refers to the disruption of electron scattering due to the sudden introduction of a perturbation. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, describes the interaction between a single magnetic impurity and the surrounding electrons. By examining the interplay between these two phenomena in graphene, this paper sheds light on the fundamental physics of electron behavior in this material and has potential implications for the development of future electronic devices.
1819	This research paper presents a multilevel analysis of the in vivo behavior of looped DNA-protein complexes. The study involves a combination of experimental and computational techniques to understand the dynamic behavior of these complexes. The findings suggest that the looped DNA-protein complexes exhibit a range of behaviors that are dependent on the specific protein components and their interactions. The study also highlights the importance of considering multiple levels of analysis to fully understand the behavior of these complexes in vivo. Overall, the research provides insights into the complex interactions between DNA and proteins in living cells.
3830	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) rebound shocks in supernovae. The main objective is to understand the role of magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of these shocks. The authors present a detailed numerical simulation of a supernova explosion that includes MHD effects. The simulation shows that the magnetic fields play a crucial role in the formation of rebound shocks and can significantly affect the dynamics of the explosion. The study also highlights the importance of considering MHD effects in models of supernova explosions. The findings of this research have important implications for our understanding of the physics of supernovae and the evolution of galaxies. Overall, the study concludes that MHD rebound shocks are a key feature of supernova explosions and should be taken into account in future models of these events.
2634	The research paper investigates the behavior of relativistic field theories in the presence of a strong background field, focusing on the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The authors develop a formalism for calculating the LLL spectrum and wave functions for various field theories, including QED and QCD, in a strong external magnetic field. They find that the LLL approximation is valid in the strong field regime and can be used to study the dynamics of particles in a magnetic field. The results have applications in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and astrophysics. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future experimental studies.
666	The article discusses the unusual doping and temperature dependence of photoemission spectra from manganites, which are materials with interesting electronic and magnetic properties. The authors studied the photoemission spectra of manganites with different doping levels and temperatures and found that the spectra exhibited unexpected features. The results suggest that the electronic and magnetic properties of manganites are more complex than previously thought and could have implications for the development of new electronic and magnetic devices. Overall, the study highlights the importance of studying the electronic properties of complex materials to uncover new phenomena and potential applications.
2932	Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally. The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces, resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.
1726	We study the quantum properties of Rydberg atoms in a magnetic Ioffe-Pritchard trap which is superimposed by a homogeneous electric field. Trapped Rydberg atoms can be created in long-lived electronic states exhibiting a permanent electric dipole moment of several hundred Debye. The resulting dipole-dipole interaction in conjunction with the radial confinement is demonstrated to give rise to an effectively one-dimensional ultracold Rydberg gas with a macroscopic interparticle distance. We derive analytical expressions for the electric dipole moment and the critical linear density of Rydberg atoms.
2516	We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring significant penalties.
1083	We investigate the behavior of a circuit QED device when the resonator is initially populated with a mesoscopic coherent field. The strong coupling between the cavity and the qubit produces an entangled state involving mesoscopic quasi-pointer states with respect to cavity dissipation. The overlap of the associated field components results in collapse and revivals for the Rabi oscillation. Although qubit relaxation and dephasing do not preserve these states, a simple analytical description of the dissipative dynamics of the circuit QED device including cavity relaxation as well as qubit dissipation is obtained from the Monte-Carlo approach. Explicit predictions for the spontaneous and induced Rabi oscillation signals are derived and sucessfully compared with exact calculations. We show that these interesting effects could be observed with a 10 photon field in forthcoming circuit QED experiments.
3927	"This research paper titled ""FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V. Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects"" focuses on the milliarcsecond-scale morphology of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources. The study uses high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) imaging techniques to investigate the detailed structure of CSS objects. The authors present the results of their observations of 22 CSS sources and provide a detailed analysis of their morphology. The study finds that the majority of CSS sources show complex structures, with evidence of multiple components and/or jet-like features. The authors conclude that these results are consistent with the idea that CSS sources are likely to be young radio sources in the process of evolving into larger-scale radio galaxies."
3225	This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth, but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic. Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit, closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a function of various system parameters.
2082	We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive measure of azimuth structure.
D2-17	Quarks and gluons are both fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, but they have distinct roles. Quarks are the building blocks of matter, combining to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. They come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks have fractional electric charges and interact via the strong nuclear force, which holds them together inside protons and neutrons. Gluons, on the other hand, are force carrier particles responsible for transmitting the strong nuclear force between quarks. Unlike quarks, gluons have no mass and no electric charge, but they do carry a property called color charge, which allows them to bind quarks together through a phenomenon known as color confinement.
3370	"The research paper ""Field-Theoretic Simulations of Polyelectrolyte Complexation"" presents a study of the complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes using field-theoretic simulations. The authors investigate the effects of various parameters such as charge density, chain length, and salt concentration on the complexation process. They find that the complexation behavior is strongly influenced by the charge density and chain length of the polyelectrolytes, as well as the ionic strength of the solution. The simulations also reveal the formation of various types of complex structures, including spherical and cylindrical micelles, as well as interconnected networks. The study provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the complexation of polyelectrolytes and has implications for a wide range of applications in fields such as biotechnology and materials science."
2972	We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
3424	This research paper investigates the ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system using numerical simulations. The primary theme is to understand the dynamics of the vortex system and its response to external driving forces. The paper finds that the system exhibits ageing memory, where its response depends on the history of the driving force. Additionally, the system shows glassy behavior, where its relaxation time increases as the temperature decreases. These findings provide insights into the complex behavior of driven vortex systems and have implications for a range of physical systems that exhibit similar dynamics.
1246	This research paper aims to identify the factors that contribute to the distinctive log-log plot of Google's PageRank algorithm. By analyzing various datasets and conducting statistical tests, the study reveals that the link structure of a website, as well as the distribution of inbound links, play a significant role in determining its PageRank score. The research also highlights the importance of considering both global and local factors when interpreting PageRank scores. These findings provide valuable insights for website owners and search engine optimization professionals seeking to improve their online visibility.
2121	An exotic approach to hadrons is discussed. It is based on the recently developed open-closed string duality explicitly conjectured as the AdS/CFT correspondence. Mesons as well as pentaquarks are studied in this approach. Spins are introduced as distribution functions over the string, and a second quantization method of string theory is examined and used to estimate the mass and decay width of various hadrons. This approach provides a way to understand the structure of flavor by a configuration of probe branes.
1454	We consider the question of cross-correlation measurements using Virgo and the LSC Interferometers (LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford, and GEO600) to search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. We find that inclusion of Virgo into the network will substantially improve the sensitivity to correlations above 200 Hz if all detectors are operating at their design sensitivity. This is illustrated using a simulated isotropic stochastic background signal, generated with an astrophysically-motivated spectrum, injected into 24 hours of simulated noise for the LIGO and Virgo interferometers.
3103	The research paper investigates the critical dynamics of random anisotropy magnets using the Model C approach. The study explores the behavior of these magnets under thermal fluctuations and external fields. The researchers found that the thermal fluctuations have a significant impact on the critical dynamics of the system. They also observed that the external field can cause the system to exhibit different behaviors, such as a phase transition or a crossover. The study concludes that the Model C approach is a useful tool for understanding the critical dynamics of random anisotropy magnets.
2618	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of reversed flow at low frequencies in a microfabricated AC electrokinetic pump.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of the findings in areas such as drug delivery and lab-on-a-chip devices.
779	We define a new family of random spin models with one-dimensional structure, finite-range multi-spin interactions, and bounded average degree (number of interactions in which each spin participates). Unfrustrated ground states can be described as solutions of a sparse, band diagonal linear system, thus allowing for efficient numerical analysis. In the limit of infinite interaction range, we recover the so-called XORSAT (diluted p-spin) model, that is known to undergo a random first order phase transition as the average degree is increased. Here we investigate the most important consequences of a large but finite interaction range: (i) Fluctuation-induced corrections to thermodynamic quantities; (ii) The need of an inhomogeneous (position dependent) order parameter; (iii) The emergence of a finite mosaic length scale. In particular, we study the correlation length divergence at the (mean-field) glass transition.
869	The paper explores the concept of equifocality in a singular Riemannian foliation. It investigates the properties of the foliation and its relationship with the geometry of the underlying manifold. The main result of the paper is the proof of equifocality of the foliation, which implies the existence of a unique geodesic in each leaf of the foliation. This result has important implications in various areas of mathematics, including differential geometry and geometric analysis. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the equifocality property and its potential applications in future research.
396	The Tracy-Widom distribution functions involve integrals of a Painlev\'e II function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus infinity. There are two consequences of these new representations. The first is the evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of the asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the distribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of Deift, Its, and Krasovsky. The constant terms for the GOE and GSE Tracy-Widom distribution functions are new.
2031	In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.

The accuracy of these potentials is evaluated by comparing them to experimental data and other theoretical methods. The results demonstrate the potential of OFDFT as a powerful tool for predicting the properties of materials and understanding their behavior at the atomic level.
1005	This research paper focuses on the trade-off between estimation diversity and energy efficiency in distributed sensing systems. The authors propose a novel algorithm that balances these two factors by adjusting the number of sensors used for each estimation task. The algorithm is evaluated through simulations, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both estimation accuracy and energy consumption. The study concludes that the proposed algorithm can be used to optimize the performance of distributed sensing systems while minimizing energy use.

D2-76	Phthalates or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably. Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers. Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most  known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.

The research analyzes the performance of two different cooperative techniques, namely, joint processing and relaying, and investigates their capacity gains. The findings suggest that cooperative techniques can significantly improve the system's capacity, and joint processing provides a higher capacity gain than relaying. The study concludes that cooperative techniques are a promising approach to enhance the capacity of wireless communication systems.

The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between magnetic fields, gas dynamics, and gravitational forces in shaping the structure and evolution of gaseous inner disks.
3970	We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.
D2-34	The main causes of lung cancer are primarily linked to smoking and environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause, responsible for about 85% of cases, as the harmful chemicals in smoke damage DNA in lung cells. Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor. Another major cause is exposure to radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive substance that can accumulate in buildings. Occupational exposures to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust also increase the risk, particularly in certain industries. Additionally, genetic factors and family history can make some individuals more susceptible, while air pollution and poor air quality further contribute to the development of lung cancer.
2893	In this paper, we investigate the number of moduli of plane sextics with exactly six cusps. Using deformation theory and a careful analysis of the geometry of the cusps, we determine that the number of moduli is equal to the dimension of the space of certain holomorphic differentials. We also prove that this number is at least 81, and we construct explicit families of sextics that achieve this lower bound. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the moduli space of plane sextics and contribute to the ongoing study of algebraic curves with singularities.
908	"It is a common assumption that quantum systems with time reversal invariance and classically chaotic dynamics have energy spectra distributed according to GOE-type of statistics. Here we present a class of systems which fail to follow this rule. We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time reversal symmetry and ""almost"" chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution is of GUE-type. The effect is due to the lack of ergodicity in the ""momentum"" part of the phase space and, as we argue, is generic in two dimensions. Besides, we show that certain billiards of constant width in multiply connected domains are of interest in relation to the quantum ergodicity problem. These billiards are quantum ergodic, but not classically ergodic."
2221	The Lee-Wick Standard Model is a theoretical framework that modifies the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing an additional set of heavy particles with negative norm. This paper presents an overview of the Lee-Wick Standard Model, including its motivation, theoretical foundations, and experimental implications. The key outcomes of the research include the explanation of the Hierarchy Problem, the prediction of new physics phenomena at the TeV scale, and the potential for experimental verification through high energy collider experiments. The Lee-Wick Standard Model represents a promising avenue for future theoretical and experimental investigations into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe.
D1-12	Biological evolution, according to Charles Darwin, refers to the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down from one generation to the next. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that individuals within a species show variation in their characteristics. These variations can affect their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Those individuals with traits that give them a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring, while less advantageous traits are gradually eliminated. Over long periods, this process leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in the population, resulting in the adaptation of species to their environment.
221	This research paper explores the concept of nontrivial geometries in the universe and provides bounds on the curvature of the universe. The study analyzes the implications of different non-Euclidean geometries and their impact on our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution. The findings suggest that the observed properties of the universe are consistent with a flat geometry within the limits of current observational data. These results have significant implications for future cosmological research and our understanding of the nature of the universe.
1376	"The research paper titled ""Phase String Theory for Doped Antiferromagnets"" investigates the behavior of doped antiferromagnets using a phase string theory approach. The study explores how the doping of antiferromagnets affects the quantum fluctuations and the ground state properties of the system. The results suggest that the doping-induced quantum fluctuations lead to the emergence of new phases in the system, such as a spin-liquid phase and a superconducting phase. Additionally, the study proposes that the phase string theory approach can be used to explain the anomalous behavior of doped cuprate superconductors. Overall, the research paper highlights the potential of the phase string theory approach for understanding the complex behavior of doped antiferromagnets and provides new insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductivity."
1559	"The thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of Weinhold's and Ruppeiner's thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its phase transition structure."

This project is part of the program for presence research, and it will exploit physiological feedback and Computational Intelligence within virtual reality.
3775	We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing the results of simulations using the effective potentials to those obtained from the ab-initio calculations. They conclude that their method is a promising tool for the study of quasicrystals and can lead to a better understanding of their unique properties."

This system is interesting per-se and as a model of liquids like glycerol (interacting via hydrogen bonds) which are excellent glass formers. We work out the statistical mechanics of this system, encoding the liquid and glass disorder using appropriate quasi-particles (36 of them). The theory provides a full explanation of the glass transition phenomenology, including the identification of a diverging length scale and a relation between the structural changes and the diverging relaxation times.
2117	This research paper focuses on the use of the Kohonen algorithm for handling missing data. The Kohonen algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to impute missing data.

The study concludes that the Kohonen algorithm is a promising approach for handling missing data and can be applied in a wide range of fields.
3449	Two-photon decay rates in simple atoms such as hydrogenlike systems represent rather interesting fundamental problems in atomic physics. The sum of the energies of the two emitted photons has to fulfill an energy conservation condition, the decay takes place via intermediate virtual states, and the total decay rate is obtained after an integration over the energy of one of the emitted photons. Here, we investigate cases with a virtual state having an energy intermediate between the initial and the final state of the decay process, and we show that due to non-uniform convergence, only a careful treatment of the singularities infinitesimally displaced from the photon integration contour leads to consistent and convergent results.
2309	This research paper investigates the formation of Ramsey fringes during the excitation of topological modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main objective of this study is to understand the behavior of topological modes in a condensate and how they can be manipulated to create Ramsey fringes.

Additionally, the study shows that the topological modes can be used as a useful tool for precision measurements and quantum information processing. The results of this study have important implications for the development of quantum technologies and the understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics.
1055	We propose a two-color scheme of atom guide and 1D optical lattice using evanescent light fields of different transverse modes. The optical waveguide carries a red-detuned light and a blue-detuned light, with both modes far from resonance. The atom guide and 1D optical lattice potentials can be transformed to each other by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to accurately control mode transformation. This might provide a new approach to realize flexible transition between the guiding and trapping states of atoms.

The study concludes that the frequency correlation is a critical factor in the design and operation of linear optical entangling gates, and optimizing it can enhance the efficiency of quantum information processing. This research contributes to the understanding of the fundamentals of quantum information processing and provides valuable insights into the development of practical quantum computing technologies.
3195	We define and solve the toric version of the symplectic ball packing problem, in the sense of listing all 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds which admit a perfect packing by balls embedded in a symplectic and torus equivariant fashion. In order to do this we first describe a problem in geometric-combinatorics which is equivalent to the toric symplectic ball packing problem. Then we solve this problem using arguments from Convex Geometry and Delzant theory. Applications to symplectic blowing-up are also presented, and some further questions are raised in the last section.
2464	A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and inflation.
287	We give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed equivariant total Chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed bundles by a linear group action. This fine moduli scheme is described explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions. We use this description to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy Murphy's Law, in the sense of Vakil. The preliminary sections of the paper give a self-contained introduction to Klyachko's classification of toric vector bundles.
551	We want to understand he concentration of damage in microfractured elastic media. Due to the different scallings of the volume and area (or area and length in two dimensions) the traditional method of homogenization using periodic arrays of cells seems to fail when applied to the Mumford-Shah functional and to periodically fractured domains. In the present paper we are departing from traditional homogenization. The main result implies the use of Mumford-Shah energies and leads to an explanation of the observed concentration of damage in microfractured elastic bodies.
1792	With more intense sources of cold and ultracold neutrons becoming available and with improved experimental techniques being developed, determination of |Vud| from neutron beta decay with a similar precision to that from from superallowed beta decays is within reach. Determination of |Vud| from neutron beta decay, free from nuclear corrections, hold the most promise for a further improvement of the determination of |Vud|. The current and future neutron beta decay correlation experiments including the UCNA experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory are reviewed
1297	A generalization of the Kauffman tangle algebra is given for Coxeter type Dn. The tangles involve a pole or order 2. The algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of the same type. This result extends the isomorphism between the two algebras in the classical case, which in our set-up, occurs when the Coxeter type is of type A with index n-1. The proof involves a diagrammatic version of the Brauer algebra of type Dn in which the Temperley-Lieb algebra of type Dn is a subalgebra.
4006	This research paper explores the possibility of geometrically engineering the Standard Model by locally unfolding three families out of the exceptional Lie group E8. We propose a novel approach to constructing the Standard Model using geometric structures derived from E8, which allows for the unification of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. Our method involves the identification and manipulation of specific substructures within E8, leading to the emergence of a three-family fermion spectrum. We investigate the implications of this approach, including potential experimental signatures, and discuss its relevance to ongoing efforts in theoretical physics. Overall, our work suggests that geometric engineering may provide a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.
2463	This research paper presents an experimental and theoretical study of light scattering by individual mature red blood cells using scanning flow cytometry and discrete dipole approximation. The main focus of the study is to understand the scattering properties of red blood cells and to develop a theoretical model that accurately predicts the scattering behavior. The study found that the discrete dipole approximation model was able to accurately predict the scattering properties of red blood cells and that the scattering behavior was highly dependent on the size, shape, and refractive index of the cells. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of new diagnostic tools for blood disorders and for the understanding of the underlying physics of light scattering in biological systems.
2469	Disk instability is an attractive yet controversial means for the rapid formation of giant planets in our solar system and elsewhere. Recent concerns regarding the first adiabatic exponent of molecular hydrogen gas are addressed and shown not to lead to spurious clump formation in the author's disk instability models. A number of disk instability models have been calculated in order to further test the robustness of the mechanism, exploring the effects of changing the pressure equation of state, the vertical temperature profile, and other parameters affecting the temperature distribution. Possible reasons for differences in results obtained by other workers are discussed. Disk instability remains as a plausible formation mechanism for giant planets.
2871	This research paper explores the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles. The central focus is on examining the behavior of magnetic particles at low temperatures and how they interact with each other to form frozen states. The study uses simulations and experiments to investigate the magnetic properties of these systems. The outcomes of the study reveal that the magnetic particles exhibit highly correlated behavior, and their interactions lead to the formation of a frozen state. The paper concludes that understanding the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles is vital for developing new materials with unique magnetic properties.

3844	This research paper investigates the superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model and analyzes the effects of vertex and non-local corrections. The main objective is to understand how these corrections impact the superconducting behavior of the system. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, the study shows that the vertex and non-local corrections can significantly alter the superconducting properties of the system. The key results suggest that the vertex correction enhances the critical temperature while the non-local correction suppresses it. Additionally, the study reveals that the non-local correction can induce a reentrant behavior of the superconducting phase. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the superconducting properties of the quasi-2D Holstein model and highlights the importance of considering vertex and non-local corrections in future studies of this system.
1746	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a Dirac field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, (background) Lorentz invariance and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons in the presence of a Dirac field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a Dirac field are also emphasized.
2231	This research paper focuses on the order of the 2D polymer escape transition, which refers to the point at which a polymer chain escapes from a confining boundary. The study uses computer simulations to investigate the critical properties of the transition and the effects of various parameters, such as chain length and confinement size. The findings suggest that the order of the transition depends on the degree of confinement and that longer chains require larger confinements to exhibit a second-order transition. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the escape transition in various physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and biological membranes. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the fundamental properties of polymer chains in confined environments and has potential applications in materials science and biophysics.

The study also shows that the fluidization mechanism in the shallow layer is different from that in a deeper layer. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of granular materials and have implications for various engineering applications.

3140	This research paper focuses on the development of conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. Invariant functionals are mathematical expressions that remain unchanged under certain transformations. Compositions, on the other hand, refer to the act of combining two or more functions to create a new one. In this study, we apply the Noether's theorem to derive the conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by considering several examples, including systems governed by differential equations. The results of this study have important implications for the fields of physics, mathematics, and engineering, as conservation laws are fundamental to understanding the behavior of physical systems. Our findings can be used to develop more accurate models and simulations of complex systems, ultimately leading to improved design and control strategies.
1614	The cosmological constant problem represents an evident tension between our present description of gravity and particle physics. Many solutions have been proposed, but experimental tests are always difficult or impossible to perform and present phenomenological investigations focus only on possible relations with the dark energy, that is with the accelerating expansion rate of the contemporary universe. Here I suggest that strange stars, if they exist, could represent an interesting laboratory to investigate this puzzle, since their equilibrium configuration is partially determined by the QCD vacuum energy density.

The interplay between electrons and phonons is crucial for the understanding of thermal and electrical conductance in nanostructures. We employ density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method to study the electron and phonon transport properties of atomic junctions. Our results reveal that the electron-phonon coupling strongly affects the transport properties in atomic junctions. Specifically, we find that the coupling between the electrons and phonons can lead to a reduction in the thermal conductance and an enhancement of the electrical conductance. These findings contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the transport properties of nanostructures, and provide insight for the design of future nanoelectronic devices.

These results provide a deeper understanding of the representation theory of these algebras and their connections to other areas of mathematics.
1415	We study the evolution of the universe which contains a multiple number of non-relativistic scalar fields decaying into both radiation and pressureless matter. We present a powerful analytic formalism to calculate the matter and radiation curvature perturbations, and find that our analytic estimates agree with full numerical results within an error of less than one percent. Also we discuss the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation components, which may be detected by near future cosmological observations, and point out that it crucially depends on the branching ratio of the decay rate of the scalar fields and that it is hard to make any model independent predictions.
3648	Partial cubes are a class of graphs that have been studied extensively due to their applications in fields such as computer science and chemistry. In this paper, we explore the structure and characterization of partial cubes, as well as their constructions. We prove several important theorems, including a characterization of partial cubes based on their cut vertices, and a construction method for partial cubes based on their spanning trees. Additionally, we investigate the properties and applications of partial cubes in various contexts, such as graph coloring and graph isomorphism. Our results provide a deeper understanding of partial cubes and their significance in both theoretical and practical domains.
1272	It is shown that vortices in linearly polarized polariton condensates in planar semiconductor microcavities carry two winding numbers (k,m). These numbers can be either integer or half-integer simultaneously. Four half-integer vortices (1/2,1/2), (-1/2,-1/2), (1/2,-1/2), and (-1/2,1/2) are anisotropic, possess the smallest energy, and define the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. The condensate concentration remains finite within the core of half-vortex and the polarization becomes fully circular in the core center.
2300	"The Schr{\""o}dinger-Robertson inequality generally provides a stronger bound on the product of uncertainties for two noncommuting observables than the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, and as such, it can yield a stricter separability condition in conjunction with partial transposition. In this paper, using the Schr{\""o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, the separability condition previously derived from the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra is made stricter and refined to a form invariant with respect to local phase shifts. Furthermore, a linear optical scheme is proposed to test this invariant separability condition."
33	We demonstrate that bistability of the nuclear spin polarization in optically pumped semiconductor quantum dots is a general phenomenon possible in dots with a wide range of parameters. In experiment, this bistability manifests itself via the hysteresis behavior of the electron Zeeman splitting as a function of either pump power or external magnetic field. In addition, our theory predicts that the nuclear polarization can strongly influence the charge dynamics in the dot leading to bistability in the average dot charge.
3749	The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
643	We study motion of small particles in turbulence when the particle relaxation time falls in the range of inertial time-scales of the flow. Due to inertia, particles drift relative to the fluid. We show that the drift velocity is close to the Lagrangian velocity increments of turbulence at the particle relaxation time. We demonstrate that the collective drift of two close particles makes them see local velocity increments fluctuate fast and we introduce the corresponding Langevin description for separation dynamics. This allows to describe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of Richardson's law for separation above viscous scale.
1965	The research paper focuses on combining observational data from H(z), CMB shift, and SNIa to place constraints on cosmological models. The study aims to determine the best-fit values for the cosmological parameters and test the validity of the standard cosmological model. The results show that the combination of these three observational datasets can provide strong constraints on the cosmological parameters, indicating that the standard cosmological model is a good fit to the data. The paper concludes that future surveys with improved observational data can further enhance the accuracy of cosmological parameter estimation.
832	The article presents an ergodic model for the expansion of spherical nanoplasmas, which is a fundamental process in laser-matter interactions. The model takes into account the non-equilibrium dynamics of the plasma, and considers the plasma expansion in the presence of an external magnetic field. The results show that the magnetic field can significantly affect the plasma expansion, leading to the formation of an anisotropic plasma cloud. The model also predicts the evolution of the plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field strength during the expansion process, providing insights into the underlying physics. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering the non-equilibrium dynamics and the role of external fields in understanding the expansion of nanoplasmas, which can have applications in areas such as plasma physics, materials science, and laser-based technologies.

The paper presents new results that demonstrate the existence of certain types of singularities in product spacetimes, and provides a detailed analysis of the causal boundary in various examples. The main conclusion of the paper is that the causal boundary of product spacetimes provides important insights into the nature of spacetime and its geometric properties."
1121	This thesis provides an overview of an approach to quantum simulations using magnesium-25 ions stored in a linear Paul trap as the carriers of quantum information. Their quantum state is manipulated and read out using ultraviolet laser beams. Several important steps towards realising the first experiments have been undertaken, the most striking of which is cooling the ions to their motional ground state. We describe a first experiment simulating cosmological particle creation in the Early Universe and discuss the expected results.
511	In this paper we present large-scale correlated calculations of linear optical absorption spectrum of oligo-acenes containing up to seven benzene rings. For the calculations we used the Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) Hamiltonian, along with the configuration interaction (CI) technique at various levels such as the full CI (FCI), the quadruple CI (QCI) and multi-reference singles-doubles CI (MRSDCI). The role of Coulomb parameters used in the P-P-P Hamiltonian was examined by considering standard Ohno parameters, as well as a screened set of parameters. A detailed analysis of the many-body character of the important excited states contributing to the linear absorption has also been performed. The results of our calculations have been compared extensively with the theoretical work of other authors, as well as with the experiments.
614	In this paper we develop a scientific approach to control inter-country conflict. This system makes use of a neural network and a feedback control approach. It was found that by controlling the four controllable inputs: Democracy, Dependency, Allies and Capability simultaneously, all the predicted dispute outcomes could be avoided. Furthermore, it was observed that controlling a single input Dependency or Capability also avoids all the predicted conflicts. When the influence of each input variable on conflict is assessed, Dependency, Capability, and Democracy emerge as key variables that influence conflict.
1481	This research paper proposes a novel modulation technique called Arbitrary Rate Permutation Modulation (ARPM) for the Gaussian channel. ARPM allows for flexible rate adaptation by permuting input symbols, enabling efficient use of bandwidth. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of ARPM's performance and compares it with existing modulation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that ARPM achieves higher spectral efficiency and better error rate performance compared to traditional modulation schemes. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of ARPM and its potential applications in modern communication systems.
1450	We study the asymptotic scaling of the entanglement of a block of spins for the ground state of the one-dimensional quantum Ising model with transverse field. When the field is sufficiently strong, the entanglement grows at most logarithmically in the number of spins. The proof utilises a transformation to a model of classical probability called the continuum random-cluster model, and is based on a property of the latter model termed ratio weak-mixing. Our proof applies equally to a large class of disordered interactions.
548	This research paper investigates the properties of scalar-tensor black holes that are coupled to Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. The authors first derive the field equations for this system and then study the solutions that arise from them. They find that the presence of the Born-Infeld field has a significant impact on the properties of the black hole, including its horizon structure and thermodynamics. Additionally, they show that the scalar field can have a nontrivial impact on the electromagnetic field, leading to novel features such as the existence of electrically charged scalar hair. The authors conclude that the coupling between scalar-tensor gravity and Born-Infeld electrodynamics provides a rich and interesting arena for exploring the properties of black holes, and that this system offers new avenues for testing gravity and electromagnetism in extreme regimes.
725	"The article ""Parametric Nonholonomic Frame Transforms and Exact Solutions in Gravity"" discusses the use of parametric nonholonomic frame transforms to find exact solutions to problems in gravity. The main focus of the article is on the mathematical techniques used to transform the coordinate system of a problem in gravity, allowing for a more straightforward solution to be found. The article presents several examples of how these techniques can be applied to find exact solutions to problems in both classical and quantum gravity. The significant outcome of the article is the demonstration of the effectiveness of these parametric nonholonomic frame transforms in solving problems in gravity, and the potential for further applications of these techniques in future research."
3459	We apply a model for sand dunes to calculate formation of dunes on Mars under the present Martian atmospheric conditions. We find that different dune shapes as those imaged by Mars Global Surveyor could have been formed by the action of sand-moving winds occuring on today's Mars. Our calculations show, however, that Martian dunes could be only formed due to the higher efficiency of Martian winds in carrying grains into saltation. The model equations are solved to study saltation transport under different atmospheric conditions valid for Mars. We obtain an estimate for the wind speed and migration velocity of barchan dunes at different places on Mars. From comparison with the shape of bimodal sand dunes, we find an estimate for the timescale of the changes in Martian wind regimes.
2273	This research paper focuses on understanding the abundance patterns in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that are undergoing third dredge-up (TDU) and hot-bottom burning (HBB). We utilize a sample of AGB stars with masses ranging from 4 to 6 solar masses and perform spectroscopic observations to determine their chemical abundances. Our analysis reveals significant enhancements of carbon, nitrogen, and s-process elements in stars undergoing TDU, which is consistent with previous theoretical predictions. Additionally, we find evidence for HBB in some stars, indicated by enhanced abundances of lithium and beryllium. Our results suggest that the interplay between TDU and HBB plays a crucial role in shaping the chemical evolution of intermediate-mass AGB stars, and has important implications for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the universe.
1292	This research paper examines the intermediate regime in the Tetrathiafulvalene-Chloranil (TTF-CA) pressure-induced neutral-ionic transition. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis, we investigate the behavior of TTF-CA under varying pressure conditions. Our findings reveal the existence of an intermediate regime where the system exhibits unique properties that differ from both the neutral and ionic states. We also identify critical pressure points that trigger the transition from the intermediate regime to the ionic state. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of TTF-CA and may have implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic and optical properties.
2673	The Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface structure has been studied using a combination of quantitative LEED I-V and ab initio methods. The study focused on the missing half-order spots in the 3x1 diffraction pattern. The results showed that the surface reconstruction is caused by the formation of a Sm-Si dimer row, which creates a new surface unit cell. The missing half-order spots are explained by a symmetry reduction due to the formation of the Sm-Si dimers. The study provides a detailed understanding of the surface structure and the origin of the missing half-order spots, which has important implications for the development of semiconductor devices.
1494	Combined effects of electron correlations and lattice distortions are investigated on the charge ordering in \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4 theoretically in a two-dimensional 3/4-filled extended Hubbard model with electron-lattice couplings. It is known that this material undergoes a phase transition from a high-symmetry metallic state to a low-symmetry insulating state with a horizontal-stripe charge order (CO) by lowering temperature. By means of the exact-diagonalization method, we show that electron-phonon interactions are crucial to stabilize the horizontal-stripe CO and to realize the low-symmetry crystal structure.
3782	This research paper examines the switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular junctions. The study focuses on the photoisomerization behavior of these compounds in molecular junctions, utilizing theoretical computations and experimental measurements. The critical outcomes of the study show that the switching behavior of the molecular junctions is highly dependent on the substituent groups present in the diarylethene molecules. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of the electronic structure and the orientation of the molecules in the junctions. The research concludes that the switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular junctions can be effectively controlled by modifying the substituent groups present in the molecules. These findings have significant implications for the development of photochromic molecular devices and contribute to the understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the switching mechanism of molecular junctions.
D2-8	Fossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked Protoceratops skulls were common as fossils. A later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals.  He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations,  which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxon.
888	Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations, these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth, five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps.
3722	This research paper presents a novel geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C). The Lie algebra sl(6,C) is an important object in mathematics and has applications in areas such as physics and representation theory. In this paper, we construct a geometric object using the Grassmannian manifold and show that it has the same Lie algebra structure as sl(6,C). We provide explicit calculations to demonstrate this result and discuss the implications of our construction. This geometric realization of sl(6,C) provides a new perspective on the structure of this Lie algebra and may lead to new insights in related fields.
2729	This research paper focuses on the fan-shaped and toric textures of mesomorphic oxadiazoles. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the relationship between molecular structure and the resulting mesophase textures. The significant findings of the study include the successful synthesis of new oxadiazole derivatives and the identification of their mesophase textures using polarized optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The study concludes that the size and shape of the mesogenic core significantly influence the mesophase textures of oxadiazoles.
1400	This research paper investigates the concept of well-gradedness in a union-closed family and proposes a method for verifying and engineering this property. The study shows that the well-gradedness property can be used to identify optimal solutions in various scenarios, including voting systems and facility location problems. The proposed method utilizes a graph-theoretic approach and computational tools to efficiently verify and engineer well-gradedness. The results indicate that the method is effective and provides practical benefits for decision-making processes. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding and application of well-gradedness in union-closed families and provides a useful tool for decision-makers in various fields.
2502	We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015+161 each has an infrared excess that can be understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid with a chondritic composition.
1015	This research paper presents the discovery of fourteen new companions from the Keck & Lick Radial Velocity Survey, including five brown dwarf candidates. The primary focus of this study was to identify and characterize new companions using high-precision radial velocity measurements. The authors discuss the significance of their findings for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The discovery of brown dwarf candidates also suggests the possibility of finding more of these objects in the future, which could provide insights into the properties and formation mechanisms of these elusive objects.
D2-84	Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life, offering critical insights into Earth's history and evolution. They provide evidence of extinct species, helping scientists reconstruct past ecosystems and understand how life has changed over millions of years. Fossils reveal how species adapted, evolved, or became extinct, shedding light on the processes of natural selection and environmental changes. Additionally, they are used to date rock layers and determine the age of geological formations, aiding in the study of Earth's geologic timeline. Fossils also provide clues about ancient climates and environmental conditions, helping researchers understand past climate changes and their impacts. By studying fossils, we gain a deeper understanding of life's diversity, the history of our planet.
758	This research paper explores the application of quantum mechanics and statistical physics to the field of economics through the lens of evolutionary game theory (EGT). The primary focus is on the use of EGT as a tool for understanding the behavior of economic agents in complex systems. The paper highlights the potential of these interdisciplinary approaches to provide new insights into economic phenomena and suggests that they may offer a more comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics than traditional approaches. Noteworthy findings include the identification of quantum-like effects in economic decision-making and the potential for these effects to explain phenomena such as market crashes and financial bubbles. The paper concludes that future research in this area could lead to significant advances in our understanding of economic systems and provide new tools for policy-makers and practitioners.
3666	It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence.
3609	This research paper focuses on measuring the density of Earth matter and testing the MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) theory. The MSW theory explains how neutrinos interact with matter as they travel through the Earth, affecting their oscillation patterns. The study used data from Super-Kamiokande, a neutrino observatory in Japan, to analyze the neutrino oscillation patterns and calculate the Earth matter density. The results showed that the MSW theory accurately predicted the oscillation patterns and provided a reliable estimate of the Earth matter density. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of neutrinos and the structure of the Earth's interior.
3958	We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) gates.
729	"Plasma instabilities can play a fundamental role in quark-gluon plasma equilibration in the high energy (weak coupling) limit. Early simulations of the evolution of plasma instabilities in non-abelian gauge theory, performed in one spatial dimension, found behavior qualitatively similar to traditional QED plasmas. Later simulations of the fully three-dimensional theory found different behavior, unlike traditional QED plasmas. To shed light on the origin of this difference, we study the intermediate case of two spatial dimensions. Depending on how the ""two-dimensional'' theory is formulated, we can obtain either behavior."
336	This research paper explores the use of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the analysis of resource-sensitive computations in programming languages. Through the use of linear logic and game semantics, we demonstrate how resource modalities can provide a powerful tool for reasoning about the allocation and consumption of resources in programming. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to the interpretation of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the construction of game models that accurately capture the behavior of resource-sensitive programs. Our findings suggest that the use of resource modalities in game semantics can greatly enhance our ability to reason about resource usage in programming languages.
198	This research paper presents a prospective modeling of land use in a Mediterranean mountain region. Through the use of remote sensing and GIS techniques, potential scenarios for land use change were developed and analyzed. The findings show that future land use patterns are influenced by various factors such as urbanization, agricultural practices and forest management policies. The study highlights the importance of sustainable land use planning in preserving the ecological and socio-economic functions of mountain regions. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers to implement measures that balance economic development with environmental conservation.
D2-3	The feasibility of extraterrestrial life is a subject of intense scientific interest, supported by discoveries in astrobiology, planetary science, and extremophile research. While no direct evidence has been found, several factors suggest its plausibility. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some located in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery of extremophiles on Earth, thriving in extreme conditions such as deep-sea vents and frozen tundras, suggests that life could also adapt to harsh extraterrestrial environments like those on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus. Additionally, complex organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been detected in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, indicating that life’s fundamental chemistry is widespread.
1265	We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.
1091	"We discuss in this article a property of action of groups by isometries called ""well displacing"". An action is said to be well displacing, if the displacement function is equivalent to the the displacement function for the action on the Cayley graph. We relate this property with the fact that orbit maps are quasi-isometric embeddings. We first describe countrexamples that shows this two notions are unrelated in general. On the other hand we explain that for a certain class of groups -- in particular hyperbolic groups -- these two properties are equivalent. In the course of our discussion, we introduce an intrinsic property of the group -- that we called the U-property -- which says quantitatively how the norm an element is controlled by the translation length of finitely many related conjugacy classes. This property play a central role in our discussion."
933	We tailor the shape and phase of the pump pulse spectrum in order to study the coherent lattice dynamics in tellurium. Employing the coherent control via splitting the pump pulse into a two-pulse sequence, we show that the oscillations due to A1 coherent phonons can be cancelled but not enhanced as compared to single pulse excitation. We further demonstrate that a decisive factor for the coherent phonon generation is the bandwidth of the pulse spectrum and not the steepness of the pulse envelope. We also observe that the coherent amplitude for long pump pulses decreases exponentially independent of the shape of the pulse spectrum. Finally, by varying the pulse chirp, we show that the coherent amplitude is independent of while the oscillation lifetime is dependent on the chirp sign.
1599	This research paper aims to investigate the properties and potential applications of graphene spin valve devices. Graphene, a two-dimensional material with unique electronic and magnetic properties, has the potential to revolutionize the field of spintronics by acting as a spin transport medium.

Additionally, the potential applications of graphene spin valves in information processing, sensing, and energy conversion will be explored. The results of this study will provide insights into the fundamental physics of graphene spin transport and pave the way for the development of novel spintronics devices.
1459	This research paper presents an ab initio density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic structure of BaFeO3. The primary focus is to investigate the effect of different exchange-correlation functionals on the electronic and magnetic properties of the material. The remarkable findings include the observation of a half-metallic behavior and the significant influence of the exchange-correlation functional on the magnetic moment and bandgap. The study concludes that the choice of the exchange-correlation functional plays a crucial role in predicting the electronic and magnetic properties of BaFeO3.
D1-5	According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller plates. These move continuously at a slow pace, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created). During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the theory of plate tectonics.
2163	The research paper focuses on assessing and propagating the impact of input uncertainty in tree-based option pricing models. The paper introduces a new method for assessing uncertainty in option pricing models that uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate a distribution of possible option prices.

The paper also discusses the importance of considering input uncertainty when making investment decisions and highlights the potential benefits of using tree-based option pricing models in this context. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the impact of input uncertainty on option pricing models and offers a new approach for assessing and propagating this uncertainty in tree-based models.
3204	"""Cool Stars in Hot Places"" is a research paper that explores the behavior of cool stars in hot environments, specifically in the atmospheres of exoplanets. The paper investigates the effects of high-energy radiation on the magnetic fields and activity of cool stars, and also examines the possibility of detecting these stars using transit observations.

The paper concludes that further research in this area is necessary to fully understand the complex interactions between cool stars and their environments."""
3486	We have recently pointed out that color magnetic field is generated in dense quark matter, i.e. color ferromagnetic phase of quark matter. Using light cone quantization, we show that gluons occupying the lowest Landau level under the color magnetic field effectively form a two dimensional quantum well (layer), in which infinitely many zero modes of the gluons are present. We discuss that the zero modes of the gluons form a quantum Hall state by interacting repulsively with each other, just as electrons do in semiconductors. Such a ferromagnetic quark matter with the layer structure of the gluons is a possible origin of extremely strong magnetic field observed in magnetars.
1392	This research paper discusses the study of pulsar radiation belts and transient radio emissions. The research aims to investigate the properties and dynamics of these phenomena and their impact on the surrounding environment. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of observational data and theoretical models, which suggest that the pulsar radiation belts are responsible for the production of transient radio emissions. These emissions exhibit a complex behavior that varies with time and frequency. The study concludes that understanding the nature of these phenomena is crucial for developing a better understanding of the pulsar emission mechanism and the processes that govern the acceleration and propagation of particles in the pulsar magnetosphere. The research provides significant insights into the physics of pulsars and highlights the importance of continued research in this field.
1027	"The research paper titled ""Large Nongaussianity from Nonlocal Inflation"" presents a new framework for inflationary models that can generate large non-Gaussianities. The authors propose a nonlocal model of inflation that incorporates higher derivative operators in the action and show that this can lead to a significant increase in the amplitude of non-Gaussianity. They derive the bispectrum and trispectrum of the primordial perturbations and find that the non-Gaussianity can be as large as the current observational bounds. The authors conclude that this new framework provides a promising avenue for future research in understanding the origin of primordial perturbations and the early universe."
791	The E_6/U(1)_N gauge extension of the Supersymmetric Standard Model, first proposed by Ma, is shown to have exactly the requisite ingredients to realize the important new idea that dark matter is the origin of neutrino mass. With the implementation of a discrete Z_2 X Z_2 symmetry, and particle content given by three {27} representations of E_6, neutrino masses are naturally generated in two loops, with candidates of dark matter in the loops. All particles of this model are expected to be at or below the TeV scale, allowing them to be observable at the LHC.
2353	This research paper explores the concept of probabilities and quantum fluctuations in the context of quantum mechanics. The main objective is to analyze the relationship between the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and the inherent fluctuations in quantum systems. Through a review of relevant literature and mathematical analysis, the study finds that quantum fluctuations are a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and can be understood through the use of probability distributions. The paper also highlights the importance of considering quantum fluctuations in the design and analysis of quantum devices. Overall, the study emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and its implications for the development of future quantum technologies.
3260	We study the effects of a high-frequency (HF) signal on the response of a noisy bistable system to a low-frequency subthreshold sinusoidal signal. We show that, by conveniently choosing the ratio of the amplitude of the HF signal to its frequency, stochastic resonance gains greater than unity can be measured at the low-frequency value. Thus, the addition of the HF signal can entail an improvement in the detection of weak monochromatic signals. The results are explained in terms of an effective model and illustrated by means of numerical simulations.
3276	This paper investigates the use of poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a finite cylinder. In particular, we focus on the development of influence matrices for the decomposition, which can be used to identify the impact of various physical and geometric parameters on the MHD equations. We present a detailed derivation of the influence matrices, as well as numerical simulations to demonstrate their efficacy. Our results highlight the importance of considering the poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of MHD equations in a finite cylinder, and provide a valuable tool for future research in this area.
3046	Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.
1490	We analyze five epochs of Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations of the nearby spiral galaxy M33. Each epoch covered nearly a square degree at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 microns. The point source catalog from the full dataset contains 37,650 stars. The stars have luminosities characteristic of the asymptotic giant branch and can be separated into oxygen-rich and carbon-rich populations by their [3.6] - [4.5] colors. The [3.6] - [8.0] colors indicate that over 80% of the stars detected at 8.0 microns have dust shells. Photometric comparison of epochs using conservative criteria yields a catalog of 2,923 variable stars. These variables are most likely long-period variables amidst an evolved stellar population. At least one-third of the identified carbon stars are variable.
635	The article describes a study of the open cluster M67 using a multisite campaign to detect Delta Scuti pulsations in blue stragglers, which are stars that appear younger than their surroundings. The study found that several blue stragglers in the cluster exhibit Delta Scuti pulsations, which can provide information about the internal structure and evolution of these stars. Additionally, the study found that the pulsation properties of the blue stragglers in M67 are similar to those observed in other open clusters, suggesting that these stars may have a common origin. Overall, the study provides insights into the properties and evolution of blue stragglers in open clusters, and highlights the importance of multisite campaigns in studying these objects.
D2-39	Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s
1057	The Landau-Zener(LZ) transition of a two-level system coupling to spin chains near their critical points is studied in this paper. Two kinds of spin chains, the Ising spin chain and XY spin chain, are considered. We calculate and analyze the effects of system-chain coupling on the LZ transition. A relation between the LZ transition and the critical points of the spin chain is established. These results suggest that LZ transitions may serve as the witnesses of criticality of the spin chain. This may provide a new way to study quantum phase transitions as well as LZ transitions.
2738	The classical characterization of \wp, as a typical concept for far field phenomena, has been successfully applied to many \w phenomena in past decades. The recent reports of superluminal tunnelling times and negative group velocities challenged this concept. A new local approach for the definition of \wvs avoiding these difficulties while including the classical definitions as particular cases is proposed here. This generalisation of the conventional non-local approach can be applied to arbitrary \w forms and propagation media. Some applications of the formalism are presented and basic properties of the concept are summarized.
2519	This research paper evaluates the validity of the axial vector commutator sum rule (AVCSR) in describing pion-pion scattering. The AVCSR is a widely accepted theoretical framework that relates the pion-pion scattering amplitude to the pion decay constant and the electromagnetic form factor of the pion. The authors analyze experimental data from the pion-pion scattering process and compare it with the predictions of the AVCSR. They find that the AVCSR provides a good description of the scattering data, supporting its validity as a theoretical tool for understanding pion-pion interactions. The authors also discuss some limitations of the AVCSR and suggest areas for future research in this field. Overall, this study provides important insights into the fundamental interactions of pions and contributes to the development of our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics.
1020	Let R be a commutative noetherian local ring and consider the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable totally reflexive R-modules. We prove that if this set is finite, then either it has exactly one element, represented by the rank 1 free module, or R is Gorenstein and an isolated singularity (if R is complete, then it is even a simple hypersurface singularity). The crux of our proof is to argue that if the residue field has a totally reflexive cover, then R is Gorenstein or every totally reflexive R-module is free.
1443	This research paper explores the superconducting state of an excitonic insulator, a material that exhibits both excitonic and superconducting properties. The central focus of the study is to understand the relationship between the excitonic and superconducting properties and the conditions required for the excitonic insulator to become a superconductor. The paper presents theoretical models and experimental evidence to support the existence of a superconducting state in the excitonic insulator, and proposes potential applications for this material in quantum computing and energy storage. The study concludes that the excitonic insulator is a promising candidate for developing new superconducting materials with unique properties.
1520	It is known that an explosive instability can occur when nonlinear waves propagate in certain media that admit 3-wave mixing. The purpose of this paper is to show that explosive instabilities can occur even in media that admit no 3-wave mixing. Instead, the instability is caused by 4-wave mixing: four resonantly interacting wavetrains gain energy from a background, and all blow up in a finite time. Unlike singularities associated with self-focussing, these singularities can occur with no spatial structure - the waves blow up everywhere in space, simultaneously.
2641	The time dependent entropy (or Leipnik's entropy) of harmonic and damped harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave function obtained by the Feynman path integral method. Our results for simple harmonic oscillator are in agrement with the literature. However, the joint entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the general properties of the envelop of the joint entropy curve for quantum systems.
1240	This research paper aims to investigate the geometry of Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how it can help to constrain the progenitor models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using multi-wavelength observations, the study identified a correlation between the orientation of the WR winds and the properties of the GRBs associated with them. These findings suggest that the geometry of WR winds plays a crucial role in the GRB progenitor models and can provide valuable insights into their formation mechanisms.
378	"The research paper titled ""Measuring Bremsstrahlung Photons in 200 GeV p+p Collisions"" investigates the production of Bremsstrahlung photons in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV. The study utilized the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to measure the photons' energy distribution and compare it with theoretical models. The findings indicate that the measured photon spectra are consistent with theoretical predictions, suggesting that Bremsstrahlung radiation is a significant contributor to the production of photons in high-energy proton-proton collisions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the production mechanisms of photons in proton-proton collisions for future studies in high-energy nuclear physics."
3287	We numerically investigated the connection between isobaric fragility and the properties of high-order stationary points of the potential energy surface in different supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures. The increase of effective activation energies upon supercooling appears to be driven by the increase of average potential energy barriers measured by the energy dependence of the fraction of unstable modes. Such an increase is sharper, the more fragile is the mixture. Correlations between fragility and other properties of high-order stationary points, including the vibrational density of states and the localization features of unstable modes, are also discussed.
D1-20	No level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even low levels of alcohol use can increase the risk of certain cancers and other health problems. While some guidelines suggest limits to reduce risks, these guidelines are based on minimizing risk rather than ensuring safety. Recent research indicates that even moderate drinking may increase the risk of chronic diseases and premature death compared to abstaining. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether. Alcohol consumption significantly impacts mental health, often exacerbating existing conditions and contributing to new ones. Alcohol initially acts as a depressant, reducing inhibitions and creating a temporary sense of relaxation or confidence.
794	The research paper analyzes the deterministic factors of stock networks based on cross-correlation in financial markets. The study uses daily stock price data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to construct a network of stocks based on cross-correlation coefficients. The researchers identify key stocks or hubs that play a vital role in the network's structure and dynamics. The analysis shows that the stock network's topology is influenced by both the underlying industry structure and the market conditions, with the market volatility being a significant determinant. The study also finds that the stock network's centralization and clustering increase during market downturns, indicating a higher degree of interdependence between stocks. These findings have practical implications for portfolio diversification and risk management strategies.
D2-16	Type 2 diabetes rates have risen dramatically worldwide since the 1980s, constituting a global health crisis. The prevalence has more than doubled over the past three decades, increasing from approximately 108 million adults in 1980 to over 537 million (10.5% of global adult population) by 2021. This surge has been particularly pronounced in middle-income countries experiencing rapid urbanization, with Pacific Islands and Middle Eastern nations showing the highest prevalence rates, while China and India have the largest absolute numbers. Key drivers include rising obesity rates, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, Westernization of diets, aging populations, and improved detection methods. While some high-income countries have shown signs of stabilization recently, global projections remain concerning, with cases expected to reach 783 million by 2045.
3817	"We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product."
564	We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the age of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the local universe may be genuinely young. Indeed, observational evidence for downsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with decreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational and theoretical viewpoints that metallicity is not an arrow of time. Consequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not necessarely young. Current observations suggest that an old stellar population is present in all metal-poor galaxies, although a couple of cases, e.g. IZw18, remain under debate. Further observations with more sentitive equipement should settle this question in the coming years.
3436	This research paper investigates the gravitational coupling of Hadamard states, which are quantum states commonly used in the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The focus is on understanding how these states interact with gravity and how this interaction can be described mathematically. Specifically, we examine the effect of curvature on the correlation functions of Hadamard states and explore the implications of this effect for the interpretation of the states in the context of quantum gravity. The paper utilizes a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to study the behavior of Hadamard states in different gravitational backgrounds. The findings contribute to the ongoing effort to develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity that can reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity.
1155	In this paper, a hierarchical cross-layer design approach is proposed to increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity. Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy consumption.
2546	This research paper explores the extension of Einstein-Lovelock theory to higher order dilaton gravity. The central focus is on studying the properties of the theory and examining its solutions. The paper finds that the theory can accommodate a wider range of solutions and provides a better understanding of the behavior of higher order gravity theories. The conclusion drawn is that the generalization of Einstein-Lovelock theory to higher order dilaton gravity offers a promising avenue for future research in the field of gravity and cosmology.
2616	This research paper explores the role of supersymmetry and gauge symmetry in the heterotic landscape. The heterotic string theory is a promising candidate for a unified theory of all fundamental forces, and the interplay between supersymmetry and gauge symmetry is crucial in understanding the physics of this theory. This paper investigates the impact of these symmetries on the potential vacua of the heterotic landscape and how they affect the predictions of the theory. We analyze various models of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories and compare their predictions with experimental data. Our findings suggest that while both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry are essential for the consistency of the heterotic string theory, their interplay has significant implications for the phenomenology of the theory.
581	The paper presents a quantum theory of orbital magnetization and its generalization to interacting systems. The theory is based on the use of the Berry phase and the adiabatic approximation, which allows for a description of the magnetic properties of quantum systems. The authors show that the theory provides a better understanding of the magnetization of materials and can be used to predict the properties of materials with potential applications in electronics and spintronics. The results suggest that the theory can be used to explain complex phenomena observed in condensed matter systems and that it has potential for use in the development of new materials.
2337	We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.
3957	This research paper investigates the effects of allene and propyne doping on rich methane premixed laminar flames. The study aims to understand the impact of these light unsaturated hydrocarbons on the flame structure and combustion characteristics. The experiments were conducted using a burner stabilized flame, and the results were analyzed using laser-based diagnostics. The findings indicate that both allene and propyne doping increase the flame speed and reduce the flame thickness, indicating enhanced combustion efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of allene and propyne leads to the formation of new intermediate species, which have significant implications for the overall combustion process. These results offer critical insights into the use of light unsaturated hydrocarbons as fuel additives to improve the efficiency and reduce emissions in combustion systems.
170	In this research paper, we investigate the ground states of a continuous family of quantum spin chains consisting of two interacting spin-1/2 particles. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we derive exact expressions for the ground state energy and correlation functions, and show that the system exhibits a rich phase diagram with multiple critical points and a topological phase transition. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of quantum spin chains and have potential applications in quantum computing and condensed matter physics.
949	In this article we develop, step by step, the framework for universal dynamical control of two-level systems (TLS) or qubits experiencing amplitude- or phase-noise (AN or PN) due to coupling to a thermal bath. A comprehensive arsenal of modulation schemes is introduced and applied to either AN or PN, resulting in completely analogous formulae for the decoherence rates, thus underscoring the unified nature of this universal formalism. We then address the extension of this formalism to multipartite decoherence control, where symmetries are exploited to overcome decoherence.

The research findings provide important insights into the behavior of quantum dots and can be useful for designing and optimizing quantum dot-based devices.
34	"The research paper titled ""Bistability of optically-induced nuclear spin orientation in quantum dots"" investigates the behavior of nuclear spins in quantum dots under various optical and magnetic conditions. The primary subject of the study is the bistability of nuclear spin orientation, which refers to the ability of the system to exist in two stable states with different spin orientations. The researchers found that by controlling the optical and magnetic fields, they could induce and manipulate the bistability of nuclear spin orientation in the quantum dots. They also discovered that the duration of the spin polarization was dependent on the strength of the magnetic field. The study's main conclusion is that the bistability of nuclear spin orientation in quantum dots can be controlled and utilized for various practical applications, such as quantum information processing and spin-based electronics."
2308	The Ramsey fringes formation during the excitation of topological coherent modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate by an external modulating field is considered. The Ramsey fringes appear when a series of pulses of the excitation field is applied. In both Rabi and Ramsey interrogations, there is a shift of the population maximum transfer due to the strong non-linearity present in the system. It is found that the Ramsey pattern itself retains information about the accumulated relative phase between both ground and excited coherent modes.
714	This research paper investigates the impact of external fields, hydrostatic pressure, and impurities on a rectangular potential barrier. The study employs theoretical analysis and simulations to assess the changes in the barrier's characteristics under varying conditions. The outcomes indicate that the barrier's height and width are significantly affected by the external fields and hydrostatic pressure, while impurities have a negligible impact. The study also highlights the potential use of these findings in developing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the fundamental physics of potential barriers and provides insights into their practical applications.
3870	In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.
1790	The aim of this article is to study a nonlinear system modeling a Non-Newtonian fluid of polymer aqueous solutions. We are interested here in the existence of weak solutions for the stationary problem in a bounded plane domain or in two-dimensional exterior domain. Due to the third order of derivatives in the non-linear term, it's difficult to obtain solution satisfying energy inequality. But with a good choice of boundary conditions, an adapt special basis and the use of the good properties of the trilinear form associated to the non-linear term, we obtain energy solutions. The problem in bounded domain is treated and the more difficult problem on non bounded domain too.
627	This research paper investigates the potential of medium tomography through the utilization of hard processes within a soft medium. The aim is to explore the ability to reconstruct the internal structure of a medium through the measurement of hard processes, such as the propagation of jets or heavy quarks, within the medium. We propose a novel approach to medium tomography that involves the measurement of the angular and energy distribution of hard probes as they traverse through the soft medium. The feasibility of this approach is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and compared to existing tomography techniques. Our results demonstrate the promising prospects of medium tomography using hard processes, which could provide valuable insights into the properties of the medium created in high-energy collisions.
2421	This research paper explores the principle of virtual work and its relationship with maximum entropy. The primary theme is the application of this principle in the context of statistical mechanics. The authors derive the maximum entropy principle from the principle of virtual work and show that it can be used to explain various phenomena in physics. The findings suggest that the principle of virtual work provides a powerful tool for understanding the principles underlying statistical mechanics. The paper concludes that the principle of virtual work has significant implications for understanding the behavior of complex systems in physics and other fields.
2509	The paper presents a novel approach using laser-driven thermocapillary convection to self-organize metal nanostructures. The researchers demonstrate that by controlling the laser power and scan speed, they can create various patterns and shapes of metal structures on a substrate. The study also reveals that the formation of the nanostructures is due to the interplay between the thermocapillary flow and surface tension. The findings suggest that this method is a promising approach for the fabrication of metal nanostructures with tunable properties for various applications.
2864	We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie, Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model, a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.
D2-97	There has been a steady increase in the number of studies investigating educational robotics and its impact on academic and social skills of young learners. Educational robots are used both in and out of school environments to enhance K–12 students’ interest, engagement, and academic achievement in various fields of STEM education. Some prior studies show evidence for the general benefits of educational robotics as being effective in providing impactful learning experiences. However, there appears to be a need to determine the specific benefits which have been achieved through robotics implementation in K–12 formal and informal learning settings. In this study, we present a systematic review of the literature on K–12 educational robotics.
4019	Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
2778	Superconducting and normal-state properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.
1250	This research paper presents a new method for classifying supersymmetric lattice gauge theories using the concept of orbifolding. The authors introduce a set of criteria that can be used to determine the symmetries and topological properties of these theories. By applying this method to a range of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, the authors are able to identify several distinct classes of theories. They also show that these classes are related to one another through a series of dualities. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.

The research provides valuable insights into the design and development of quantum-based displacement detectors for various applications.

1478	We study the magnetotransport in small hybrid junctions formed by high-mobility GaInAs/InP heterostructures coupled to superconducting (S) and normal metal (N) terminals. Highly transmissive superconducting contacts to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) located in a GaInAs/InP heterostructure are realized by using a Au/NbN layer system. The magnetoresistance of the S/2DEG/N structures is studied as a function of dc bias current and temperature. At bias currents below a critical value, the resistance of the S/2DEG/N structures develops a strong oscillatory dependence on the magnetic field, with an amplitude of the oscillations considerably larger than that of the reference N/2DEG/N structures. The experimental results are qualitatively explained by taking Andreev reflection in high magnetic fields into account.
1266	This research paper investigates the application of Zipf's law in analyzing the popularity distribution of chess openings. The study uses a large dataset of chess games to analyze the frequency of usage of different opening moves. The findings reveal that the popularity distribution of chess openings follows Zipf's law, with a small number of openings being used more frequently than the rest. The results also suggest that the Zipfian nature of the opening popularity distribution is robust across different levels of play and time periods. The implications of this study suggest that the Zipfian distribution could be used in predicting the popularity of new chess openings. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the patterns of usage in chess openings and provides new insights into the application of Zipf's law in the analysis of complex systems.
819	Karabulut and Sibert (\textit{J. Math. Phys}. \textbf{38} (9), 4815 (1997)) have constructed an orthogonal set of functions from linear combinations of equally spaced Gaussians. In this paper we show that they are actually eigenfunctions of a q-oscillator in coordinate representation. We also reinterpret the coordinate representation example of q-oscillator given by Macfarlane as the functions orthogonal with respect to an unusual inner product definition. It is shown that the eigenfunctions in both q-oscillator examples are infinitely degenerate.
686	This paper presents a study on the fabrication and structural characterization of uranium-based multilayers. The focus is on investigating the effects of different deposition conditions on the morphology and crystal structure of the multilayers.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of these multilayers in various fields, including nuclear energy and materials science.
78	This research paper investigates the formation and propagation of magnetosonic solitons in a dusty plasma slab. Using a one-dimensional model, the interactions between the charged particles and the magnetic field were taken into account. The results showed that the dusty plasma slab supported the formation of magnetosonic solitons, which propagate with a constant amplitude and velocity. The amplitude and width of the solitons were found to depend on the dust density and magnetic field strength. The study also revealed that the presence of dust particles in the plasma significantly altered the soliton's behavior, causing it to exhibit a new mode of oscillation. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of dusty plasmas and could be useful in developing new technologies for plasma-based devices.
245	The frictional heating by ion-neutral drift is calculated and its effect on isobaric thermal instability is carried out. Ambipolar drift heating of one-dimensional self-gravitating magnetized molecular slab is used under the assumptions of quasi-magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibrium. We see that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions. The results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in some regions of the slab; therefore it may produce the slab fragmentation and formation of the AU-scale condensations.
3564	The non-Abelian feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results in the gluons losing more energy than quarks in the medium formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Experimental results in p+p collisions when compared to NLO pQCD calculations show that at high transverse momentum (pT) the produced protons+anti-protons are dominantly from gluon jets and charged pions have substantial contribution from quark jets. If such a scenario is applied to heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, one would expect the difference in quark and gluon energy loss to have an effect on measured observables, such as high pT pbar(p)/pi ratios and the nuclear modification factor for various particles species. We discuss the experimental results and some possible future measurements.

Among these exoplanets, the search for potentially habitable planets, or ""cryptoplanets,"" has been of particular interest. In this research paper, we provide an update on the latest findings in the search for cryptoplanets, including the detection methods used, the characteristics of known cryptoplanets, and the prospects for future discoveries. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the search for extraterrestrial life and the understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Our analysis suggests that while the search for cryptoplanets remains challenging, recent advancements in technology and observational techniques are bringing us closer to identifying potentially habitable worlds beyond our own."
3800	"This paper explores the concept of monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups, which are known for their unusual and intricate properties. We begin by reviewing the basic theory of Thompson groups and their associated monoid structures. We then introduce a new class of monoids, which we call ""Thompson-like monoids"", that generalize the Richard Thompson groups and exhibit similar algebraic and geometric properties. We investigate the relationship between these monoids and their associated groups, and provide examples of new monoids that arise from this construction. Finally, we discuss potential applications of these monoid generalizations in group theory and topology. Overall, this paper provides a new perspective on the Richard Thompson groups and demonstrates the richness of their underlying algebraic structures."

3533	This research paper proposes a game-theoretic approach for power control in Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) wireless networks. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of the network while ensuring a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) for the users. The proposed algorithm is based on a non-cooperative game where each user autonomously adjusts its transmit power based on the channel conditions and the actions of the other users. The Nash equilibrium of the game is shown to exist and be unique under mild assumptions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional fixed power allocation schemes in terms of energy efficiency and fairness. The paper concludes that game theory can be a promising tool for power control in IR-UWB networks, providing a balance between energy efficiency and QoS.
3055	The paper focuses on analyzing the overhead and packet lengths of random linear coding over the erasure channel. The authors investigate the impact of the number of packets and the size of the field on the overhead and packet length. They also present a new algorithm that reduces the overhead of random linear coding. The results of their analysis show that the overhead and packet length increase with the number of packets and decrease with the size of the field. Moreover, the new algorithm they propose reduces the overhead significantly. The paper provides insights into the design of practical random linear coding systems and shows that random linear coding can achieve high efficiency and reliability over the erasure channel.
1642	We report a computational first-principles study of positron trapping at vacancy defects in metals and semiconductors. The main emphasis is on the energetics of the trapping process including the interplay between the positron state and the defect's ionic structure and on the ensuing annihilation characteristics of the trapped state. For vacancies in covalent semiconductors the ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling the localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not strongly affect the characteristic features of the electronic structure, e.g., the ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal vacancies the positron-induced ion relaxation has a noticeable effect on the calculated positron lifetime and momentum distribution of annihilating electron-positron pairs.
D1-17	The recommended number of eggs to consume per week varies depending on several factors, including individual health, dietary preferences, and overall dietary patterns. It's important to note that while eggs are a nutritious food, they are also relatively high in dietary cholesterol. According to general guidelines, including those provided by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, consuming up to seven eggs per week is considered reasonable and can be part of a healthy diet for most people. However, it's important to consider the overall context of your diet, including other sources of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as your individual health goals and any specific dietary restrictions or considerations you may have.

The results have important implications in the field of nuclear physics and astrophysics.

3627	The widespread use of genetic testing in high risk pregnancies has created strong interest in rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics for common chromosomal aneuploidies. We show here that digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) can be used for accurate measurement of trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome), the most common human aneuploidy. dPCR is generally applicable to any aneuploidy, does not depend on allelic distribution or gender, and is able to detect signals in the presence of mosaics or contaminating maternal DNA.
3671	Astrophysical gyrokinetics is a branch of plasma physics that studies the behavior of weakly collisional plasmas in a magnetized environment. This research paper focuses on the kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in such plasmas. By using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we investigate how the energy is transferred from large-scale motions to small-scale fluctuations, and how these fluctuations affect the plasma transport and heating processes. Our results show that the turbulent cascades in weakly collisional plasmas are highly anisotropic, with energy flowing predominantly along the magnetic field lines. We also find that the collisionless dissipation mechanisms, such as Landau damping and wave-particle interactions, play a crucial role in regulating the turbulent energy transfer. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of various astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks, solar wind, and magnetospheres.
2014	We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
1224	This research paper explores the idea of wormholes as a potential foil to black holes. The primary focus is on the theoretical concept of traversable wormholes and their potential use as a mechanism for evading or escaping black holes. The paper discusses the mathematical models and physical properties of wormholes and black holes, and explores the potential implications of using wormholes as a means of communication or transport. Noteworthy findings include the potential for wormholes to serve as a means of bypassing the event horizon of a black hole, and the potential for wormholes to allow for faster-than-light travel. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges and limitations of wormhole technology and the need for further research in this area.

967	This research paper focuses on the dynamics of a strongly interacting Fermi gas and examines the radial quadrupole mode of the gas. The authors use a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to study the behavior of the gas under different conditions. The findings suggest that the radial quadrupole mode can be used as a sensitive probe of the properties of the gas, including its temperature and interaction strength. The paper concludes that the radial quadrupole mode is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting Fermi gases and could have important applications in areas such as quantum computing and condensed matter physics.
135	The existing field theories are based on the properties of closed exterior forms, which correspond to conservation laws for physical fields. In the present paper it is shown that closed exterior forms corresponding to field theories are obtained from the equations modelling conservation (balance) laws for material sistems (material media). The process of obtaining closed exterior forms demonstrates the connection between field-theory equations and the equations for material sistems and points to the fact that the foundations of field theories must be conditioned by the properties of equations conservation laws for material sistems.
2879	This paper presents the Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) model, a self-organizing network that categorizes input data based on their similarity and arranges them in a topological order. The model uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the network's topology and adapt its parameters to better fit the input data. The ENG model was tested on several datasets and showed superior performance compared to other clustering and classification algorithms. The research findings suggest that the ENG model can be useful in various applications such as pattern recognition, data visualization, and anomaly detection.
2487	Tau functions expressed as fermionic expectation values are shown to provide a natural and straightforward description of a number of random processes and statistical models involving hard core configurations of identical particles on the integer lattice, like a discrete version simple exclusion processes (ASEP), nonintersecting random walkers, lattice Coulomb gas models and others, as well as providing a powerful tool for combinatorial calculations involving paths between pairs of partitions. We study the decay of the initial step function within the discrete ASEP (d-ASEP) model as an example.
3478	The Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that is valid for a chemical reaction that proceeds along the reaction coordinate over the transition state is extended to molecular dynamics trajectories that in general do not cross the dividing surface between the initial and the final local minima at the exact transition state. Our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle states that low energy molecular dynamics trajectories are more likely to lead into the basin of attraction of a low energy local minimum than high energy trajectories. In the context of global optimization schemes based on molecular dynamics our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle implies that using low energy trajectories one needs to visit a smaller number of distinguishable local minima before finding the global minimum than when using high energy trajectories.

1345	We present a synthetic spectral analysis of nearly the entire far ultraviolet International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive of spectra of dwarf novae in or near outburst. The study includes 46 systems of all dwarf nova subtypes both above and below the period gap. The spectra were uniformly analyzed using synthetic spectral codes for optically thick accretion disks and stellar photospheres along with the best-available distance measurements or estimates. We present newly estimated accretion rates and discuss the implications of our study for disk accretion physics and CV evolution.
487	We have measured the angular diameter of the transiting extrasolar planet host star HD 189733 using the CHARA O/IR interferometric array. Combining our new angular diameter of 0.377+/-0.024 mas with the Hipparcos parallax leads to a linear radius for the host star of 0.779+/-0.052 Rsol and a radius for the planet of 1.19+/-0.08 RJup. Adopting the mass of the planet as derived by its discoverers, we derive a mean density of the planet of 0.91+/-0.18 g cm-3. This is the first determination of the diameter of an extrasolar planet through purely direct means.
1215	We study the effect of mass imbalance on the phase diagram of a two-component fermionic mixture with attractive interactions in optical lattices. Using static and dynamical mean-field theories, we show that the pure superfluid phase is stable for all couplings when the mass imbalance is smaller than a limiting value. For larger imbalance, phase separation between a superfluid and a charge-density wave takes place when the coupling exceeds a critical strength. The harmonic trap induces a spatial segregation of the two phases, with a rapid variation of the density at the boundary.
4018	"The research paper titled ""Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data"" investigates the gamma-ray emission from the Sun using data from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). The study shows that the emission is extended beyond the solar disk, indicating the presence of a halo of gamma rays around the Sun. The analysis also finds evidence of anisotropy in the emission, suggesting that the gamma rays may be produced by cosmic rays interacting with the solar wind. Overall, the study provides new insights into the nature of solar gamma-ray emission and its relationship to the solar wind."
734	We analyze supersymmetry breaking by anti-self-dual flux in the deformed conifold. This theory has been argued to be a dual realization of susy breaking by antibranes. As such, one might expect it to lead to a hierarchically small breaking scale, but only if the warp factor is taken into account. We verify this by explicitly computing the warp-modified moduli space metric. This leads to a new term, with a power-like divergence at the conifold point, which lowers the breaking scale. We finally point out various puzzles regarding the gauge theory interpretation of these results.
3744	"The research paper titled ""Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts"" investigates the behavior of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs) in a two-dimensional electron gas. The main theme of the paper is the study of counterflow, where electrons are injected from opposite sides of the QPCs and flow in opposite directions. The authors report that when the QPCs are close together, the counterflow of electrons is suppressed due to the Coulomb interaction between them. However, when the QPCs are separated by a distance larger than the electron wavelength, the counterflow becomes dominant. The paper concludes that the behavior of electrons in QPCs is highly dependent on their distance and Coulomb interaction, and these findings could have implications for the development of new electronic devices."
1598	Graphene - a single atomic layer of graphite - is a recently-found two-dimensional form of carbon, which exhibits high crystal quality and ballistic electron transport at room temperature. Soft magnetic NiFe electrodes have been used to inject polarized spins into graphene and a 10% change in resistance has been observed as the electrodes switch from the parallel to the antiparallel state. This coupled with the fact that a field effect electrode can modulate the conductivity of these graphene films makes them exciting potential candidates for spin electronic devices.

3640	"The research paper titled ""Couplings between a single massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry (3,1) and one vector field"" explores the interaction between a massless tensor field and a vector field. The paper focuses on a specific type of tensor field with mixed symmetry (3,1), and investigates the couplings between this field and a vector field in the context of general relativity. The authors derive the equations of motion for both fields and analyze the resulting dynamics. They find that the tensor field has both propagating and non-propagating modes, and that the vector field can interact with both types of modes. The paper concludes that this coupling between the tensor and vector fields has important implications for gravitational waves and the overall behavior of the universe."
2052	This research paper investigates the feasibility of using donor type semiconductors as maser active medium at low temperatures. The study involved the fabrication of a maser device using a specially designed donor type semiconductor material. The device was then subjected to various tests to determine its performance as a maser active medium. The results showed that the donor type semiconductor material was able to produce coherent microwave radiation, making it a promising candidate for maser applications. The paper concludes that further research is needed to optimize the fabrication process and improve the performance of the donor type semiconductor maser device. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of using donor type semiconductors as maser active media at low temperatures.
3944	I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory of electron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of the electron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate parameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate superconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are examined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity. Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions and phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.
1730	Photoluminescence is commonly used to identify the electronic structure of individual nanotubes. But, nanotubes naturally occur in bundles. Thus, we investigate photoluminescence of nanotube bundles. We show that their complex spectra are simply explained by exciton energy transfer between adjacent tubes, whereby excitation of large gap tubes induces emission from smaller gap ones via Forster interaction between excitons. The consequent relaxation rate is faster than non-radiative recombination, leading to enhanced photoluminescence of acceptor tubes. This fingerprints bundles with different compositions and opens opportunities to optimize them for opto-electronics.
3858	These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
2174	This paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of highly-committed, well-connected opinion leaders endowed with a strong convincing power. Each individual, located at a vertex of a directed graph, is characterized by her name, the list of people she is interacting with, her level of awareness, and her opinion. Various temporal evolutions according to different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the formation of strongly polarized subgroups, each adopting the opinion of one of the two groups of opinion leaders, is favored.
42	This paper investigates particle motion in the rotating black ring metric, a solution to the equations of General Relativity describing a five-dimensional black hole with a ring topology around its event horizon. The authors derive the equations of motion for test particles moving in this metric and analyze their behavior in various regimes, including geodesic motion, circular orbits, and chaotic trajectories. They find that the black ring metric exhibits several interesting features, such as the existence of stable circular orbits in the plane of rotation and the appearance of chaotic behavior for particles with nonzero angular momentum. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of black hole spacetimes and may have implications for astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks and binary black hole mergers.
2336	This research paper examines the classical nucleation theory in ordering alloys precipitating with L12 structure. The study aims to understand the fundamental principles of nucleation and growth in these alloys through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations. The results show that the classical nucleation theory can accurately describe the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern the nucleation and growth of these materials. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the effects of lattice strain and chemical composition on the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and growth of L12 precipitates in ordering alloys.
1217	This work presents an extended formulation of maximal stiffness design, within the framework of the topology optimization. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation behind the strut-and-tie modeling. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with the help of two examples.

The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of neutron stars and the role of low T/|W| bar-mode instability in their evolution.

The study also explores the symmetries of these theories, such as their gauge symmetries and the relations between them. The key findings of this research paper suggest that braided quantum field theories possess rich mathematical structures, and their symmetries play a crucial role in understanding their properties. These findings could have significant implications for the development of new theoretical frameworks for describing complex physical phenomena in quantum systems.
D2-48	Educational robotics represents an innovative approach to learning that combines technology with hands-on experience, offering numerous benefits for students across different age groups. Educational robotics provides a strong foundation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As students engage with robotics, they naturally develop capabilities in these critical disciplines, preparing them for future academic and career challenges. This approach is increasingly viewed as a strategic way to introduce and incentivize students to pursue careers in STEM fields. Beyond technical knowledge, robotics education cultivates essential life skills that benefit students regardless of their eventual career path. Students working with robotics develop problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and resilience when facing challenges.
3815	We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity.
3584	We elaborate a theory for the modeling of concepts using the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. Concepts are represented by vectors in the complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics and membership weights of items are modeled by quantum weights calculated following the quantum rules. We apply this theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that experimental data of membership weights of items with respect to the disjunction of concepts can be modeled accurately. It is the quantum effects of interference and superposition, combined with an effect of context, that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and underextension observed as deviations from a classical use of the disjunction. We put forward a graphical explanation of the effects of overextension and underextension by interpreting the quantum model applied to the modeling of the disjunction of concepts.
179	This paper presents a geometric description of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on Lie affgebroids subject to affine nonholonomic constraints. We define the notion of nonholonomically constrained system, and characterize regularity conditions that guarantee that the dynamics of the system can be obtained as a suitable projection of the unconstrained dynamics. It is shown that one can define an almost aff-Poisson bracket on the constraint AV-bundle, which plays a prominent role in the description of nonholonomic dynamics. Moreover, these developments give a general description of nonholonomic systems and the unified treatment permits to study nonholonomic systems after or before reduction in the same framework. Also, it is not necessary to distinguish between linear or affine constraints and the methods are valid for explicitly time-dependent systems.
D2-58	The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded in a process called inflation. As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental particles and then atoms formed, eventually leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (leftover heat from the early universe) and the abundance of light elements, strongly supports this theory. The Big Bang also explains the universe's large-scale structure and the observed redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates the ongoing expansion of space.
1933	This research paper investigates the feasibility of using mechanical unzipping data to infer DNA sequences in the large-bandwidth case. We propose a novel method that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and physical models to reconstruct DNA sequences from the mechanical unzipping data. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the mechanical unzipping force distribution contains information about the underlying DNA sequence. We validate our method using simulated data and demonstrate its effectiveness on experimental data obtained from a high-bandwidth mechanical unzipping setup. Our results suggest that mechanical unzipping can be a promising approach for fast and accurate DNA sequencing, especially in high-bandwidth scenarios.
1931	This research paper explores the existence proofs of some EXIT (Extrinsic Information Transfer) like functions. The EXIT function is a crucial tool in analyzing the performance of iterative decoding algorithms in communication systems. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the existence of certain types of EXIT functions, including the polynomial and rational functions. The study also explores the relationship between the existence of these functions and the properties of the underlying communication channels. The findings reveal that the existence of certain types of EXIT functions is closely related to the characteristics of the channel, such as its capacity and noise characteristics. The research provides valuable insights into the fundamental properties of EXIT functions and their role in communication systems.
2247	"The research paper ""Stars and the holographic upper bound on gravitational action"" explores the holographic principle and its implications for the gravitational action of stars. The authors propose a new holographic bound on the action of stars, which constrains the amount of information that can be contained within their gravitational fields. They apply this bound to several astrophysical systems, including neutron stars and black holes, and find that it is consistent with observational data. The authors conclude that the holographic principle provides a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental nature of gravity and the behavior of stars in the universe."
651	In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable configuration is a small-world graph.
717	The melanin is a group of biological pigments commonly found in living beings, it can be classified in three groups: eumelanin human beings, pheomelanins in animals, and allomelanins in the vegetal kingdom. There is a special interest in the eumelanin because this biopolymer exhibits the typical properties of a semiconductor. Eumelanin is also responsible of the main cellular photoprotection mechanisms in the human beings. The exact structural pattern of eumelanin is not completely known yet, the planar molecules 5, 6-indolquinine and its reduced forms semiquinone and hydroquinone outline the greater part of the biological pigment. In this work the structural, electronic and optical properties of monomers in various charged states (0, -1) and dimmers of eumelanin in vacuum, are found for the neutral state of charge, by means of the Semiempirical methods MNDO, AM1, PM3 and ZINDO/S-CI
2325	We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational mode.
2921	Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied. Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric fibration.
3048	Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.
385	This research paper investigates the transport properties of disordered graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) through a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. The study focuses on the impact of different types of disorder on the electronic transport behavior of GNRs, including edge disorder and vacancy defects. Our findings reveal that edge disorder can significantly reduce the transport gap in GNRs and enhance the conductance of the system, while vacancy defects lead to localized states that impede the transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that the transport properties of GNRs are strongly influenced by the width of the ribbon and the degree of disorder. The results of our study provide important insights into the design and optimization of graphene-based devices for electronic and optoelectronic applications.
1500	We consider the stability of a porous medium submitted to a steady-state flow with free-boundary. Assuming some hypotheses, it is possible to implement the kinematic method by using an approximate pressure field bounding the true pressure field from below. We are interested in finding such approximate pressure fields and in proving that they bound the true pressure field from below without knowing the true pressure field. We use fields which are solutions of a problem with relaxed conditions with regard to the real problem. Under a uniqueness condition of the solution of a weak formulation of the problem, such fields are lower bounds for the true pressure field. Finally, we give the example of a vertical dam.
3123	We explore the conductance of self-healing materials as a measure of the material integrity in the regime of the onset of the initial fatigue. Continuum effective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported. Our results illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onset of the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-like time-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damage regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality degradation.
2303	"The research paper titled ""Tait's conjectures and odd crossing number amphicheiral knots"" explores the properties of amphicheiral knots, which are mirror images of each other. The paper focuses on Tait's conjectures, which suggest that certain properties of a knot can be determined solely by its planar diagram. The authors provide new evidence for these conjectures by examining odd crossing number amphicheiral knots, and show that they satisfy Tait's conjectures. The paper also introduces new techniques for studying knots and provides insights into the symmetry and topology of amphicheiral knots. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of Tait's conjectures in understanding the properties of knots and sheds light on the fascinating world of knot theory."
2852	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of persistent currents in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). SQUIDs are widely used in various applications, including magnetometry, quantum computing, and medical imaging. The persistent currents in SQUIDs are of great interest because they can provide a stable and sensitive measure of magnetic fields with a high degree of accuracy. However, the origin and behavior of these currents are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical and experimental aspects of persistent currents in SQUIDs, including their dependence on temperature, magnetic field, and material properties. We also examine the various techniques used to measure these currents and their potential applications in different fields. Our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental physics of superconductivity and could lead to the development of more efficient and effective SQUIDs for practical applications.
3835	In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives.

3190	The CORSIKA program, usually used to simulate extensive cosmic ray air showers, has been adapted to work in a water or ice medium. The adapted CORSIKA code was used to simulate hadronic showers produced by neutrino interactions. The simulated showers have been used to study the spatial distribution of the deposited energy in the showers. This allows a more precise determination of the acoustic signals produced by ultra high energy neutrinos than has been possible previously. The properties of the acoustic signals generated by such showers are described.
1764	Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to investigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In particular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion reactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry energy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting result and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the theoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams.
2843	Comprehensive x-ray scattering studies, including resonant scattering at Mn L-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, were performed on single crystals of TbMn2O5. X-ray intensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectric phases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks. Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the modulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction induced ferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of multiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences. The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed to discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin frustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate phase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase domain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.
1097	We investigate the total spin in an individual single-wall carbon nanotube quantum dot with various numbers of electrons in a shell by using the ratio of the saturation currents of the first steps of Coulomb staircases for positive and negative biases. The current ratio reflects the total-spin transition that is increased or decreased when the dot is connected to strongly asymmetric tunnel barriers. Our results indicate that total spin states with and without magnetic fields can be traced by this method.
3941	"The research paper titled ""The Arctic Circle Revisited"" focuses on the changes occurring in the Arctic region due to climate change. The paper discusses the melting of glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, as well as the impact of these changes on the Arctic ecosystem and the people living in the region. The authors conclude that urgent action is needed to address the effects of climate change in the Arctic, as the consequences will be felt not only in the Arctic region but also globally. The paper also highlights the need for more research to better understand the complex and interconnected systems in the Arctic and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing the vulnerability of the Arctic and taking immediate action to address the impacts of climate change."
712	This research paper investigates the electronic emission properties of bi-layer novel organic semiconductor systems. The study analyzes the effect of the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer on the electronic properties of the bi-layer system. The results show that the electronic emission properties of the bi-layer system depend strongly on the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer. The study also finds that the bi-layer system exhibits improved electronic properties compared to the individual organic semiconductor layers. These findings suggest that bi-layer novel organic semiconductor systems have potential applications in electronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
3332	The work reported below is a first of its kind study of the properties of turbulent flow without strong mean shear in a Newtonian fluid in proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, with emphasis on the small scale aspects. The main tools used are a three-dimensional particle tracking system (3D-PTV) allowing to measure and follow in a Lagrangian manner the field of velocity derivatives and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The comparison of flow properties in the turbulent (A), intermediate (B) and non-turbulent (C) regions in the proximity of the interface allows for direct observation of the key physical processes underlying the entrainment phenomenon. The differences between small scale strain and enstrophy are striking and point to the definite scenario of turbulent entrainment via the viscous forces originating in strain.
3734	This research paper investigates the growth of single-crystal Al2O3 layers on Nb (110) thin films through a layer-by-layer deposition process. The primary theme of the study is to explore the impact of strain on the growth of Al2O3 on Nb (110) thin films and its electronic properties. The essential findings of the study suggest that the strained Al2O3 layers exhibit a unique electronic structure, with the formation of new electronic states near the Fermi level. The study also highlights the potential of strained Al2O3/Nb (110) thin films for the development of novel electronic devices and future applications in the field of materials science.
2471	"This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions."
190	We describe a program for computing the abundances of light elements produced during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis which is publicly available at http://parthenope.na.infn.it/. Starting from nuclear statistical equilibrium conditions the program solves the set of coupled ordinary differential equations, follows the departure from chemical equilibrium of nuclear species, and determines their asymptotic abundances as function of several input cosmological parameters as the baryon density, the number of effective neutrino, the value of cosmological constant and the neutrino chemical potential. The program requires commercial NAG library routines.
2228	Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.
1924	The usual scenario in fault tolerant quantum computation involves certain amount of qubits encoded in each code block, transversal operations between them and destructive measurements of ancillary code blocks. We introduce a new approach in which a single code layer is used for the entire computation, in particular a surface code. Qubits can be created, manipulated and non-destructively measured by code deformations that amount to `cut and paste' operations in the surface. All the interactions between qubits remain purely local in a two-dimensional setting.
3047	This research paper investigates the coupling of whispering-gallery modes in size-mismatched microdisk photonic molecules. By utilizing numerical simulations and experimental measurements, we demonstrate the existence of mode coupling and identify the conditions under which it occurs. Our results reveal that the coupling strength is influenced by the size and separation distance of the microdisks. Furthermore, we observe that the coupling can lead to the creation of new modes and spectral splitting. These findings provide insights into the design and optimization of photonic devices based on microdisk photonic molecules.
2723	This research paper aims to investigate the generation of entanglement outside of the light cone, which refers to a phenomenon where two quantum particles share a state despite being separated by a distance that is too great for any signal to travel between them. The study explores the possibility of creating such entanglement and examines its potential applications in quantum communication and computation. The research findings indicate that entanglement outside of the light cone can be generated through certain physical processes, and its properties have been characterized and analyzed. The paper concludes that this phenomenon has significant implications for the development of future quantum technologies and provides a promising avenue for exploring the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
3526	The conditions for proper definitions in mathematics are given, in terms of the theory of definition, on the basis of the criterions of eliminability and non-creativity. As a definition, Russell's antinomy is a violation of the criterion of eliminability (Behmann, 1931; Bochvar, 1943). Following the path of the criterion of non-creativity, this paper develops a new analysis of Comprehension schema and, as a consequence, proof that Russell's antinomy argumentation, despite the words of Frege himself, does not hold in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik. According to Basic Law (III), the class of classes not belonging to themselves is a class defined by a function which can not take as argument its own course of value. In other words, the class of classes not belonging to themselves is a class whose classes are not identical to the class itself.
2490	This research paper explores the relationship between novelty and collective attention in social media platforms. The authors analyze a dataset of over 160 million tweets to examine how novelty affects the spread of information and the attention of users. They find that new information is more likely to attract attention and be shared, but that the impact of novelty diminishes over time. Additionally, they find that users tend to focus their attention on a small number of topics, leading to a polarization of attention. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of novelty and attention in online communities.
737	We introduce a simple quantum mechanical model in which time and space are discrete and periodic. These features avoid the complications related to continuous-spectrum operators and infinite-norm states. The model provides a tool for discussing the probabilistic interpretation of generally-covariant quantum systems, without the confusion generated by spurious infinities. We use the model to illustrate the formalism of general-relativistic quantum mechanics, and to test the definition of multiple-event probability introduced in a companion paper. We consider a version of the model with unitary time-evolution and a version without unitary time-evolution
3313	We examine transport through a quantum dot coupled to three ferromagnetic leads in the regime of weak tunnel coupling. A finite source-drain voltage generates a nonequilibrium spin on the otherwise non-magnetic quantum dot. This spin accumulation leads to magnetoresistance. A ferromagnetic but current-free base electrode influences the quantum-dot spin via incoherent spin-flip processes and coherent spin precession. As the dot spin determines the conductance of the device, this allows for a purely magnetic transistor-like operation. We analyze the effect of both types of processes on the electric current in different geometries.
3645	A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
3818	The classification of superpotentials is a crucial topic in the field of mathematical physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of different types of superpotentials and their properties.

We then classify superpotentials based on their symmetries and show how this classification can be used to derive important results in quantum mechanics and string theory. Our analysis also highlights the critical outcomes of our study, including the discovery of new classes of superpotentials and their potential applications in various areas of physics. Overall, our research provides significant insights into the classification of superpotentials and offers new perspectives for future research in this field.

Overall, this research paper provides important insights into the feasibility and potential of ground-based direct detection of exoplanets using the GPI.
514	The research paper investigates the ordering of fluids in narrow capillaries. The authors analyze the helical, angular, and radial ordering of fluids in capillaries of varying diameters and surface properties. They find that the ordering of fluids is influenced by the capillary diameter and the surface properties, with narrower capillaries and hydrophobic surfaces promoting greater ordering. Additionally, they observe that the ordering of fluids in capillaries can be manipulated by changing the flow rate and the surface properties. The authors conclude that their findings have implications for the design of microfluidic devices and porous materials for applications such as filtration and separation.
2550	The research paper focuses on the entropy function and the attractor mechanism for spherically symmetric extremal black holes. It examines the relationship between the entropy function and the near horizon geometry of the black hole, and how it leads to the attractor mechanism. The paper also explores the implications of the attractor mechanism for understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy. The findings suggest that the attractor mechanism provides a powerful tool for studying the thermodynamics of black holes and may help uncover the underlying quantum theory that governs their behavior.
2379	This research paper explores the formation of vortices through the merging and interference of multiple trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of the condensates and their interactions with each other. The results show that the merging of condensates can lead to the formation of vortex rings, while interference between them can produce more complex vortex structures. The study also highlights the importance of the initial conditions and trap geometry in determining the resulting vortex patterns. The findings provide insights into the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates in complex systems and may have implications for the development of future quantum technologies.
25	From a detailed analysis of InN epilayers deposited in a close-coupled showerhead metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system under various conditions we investigate the effect of growth parameters on the lattice constants of the InN layer. The layers are under significant internal hydrostatic stress which influences the optical properties. Samples typically fall into two broad categories of stress, with resultant luminescence emission around 0.8eV and 1.1eV. We can correlate the internal stress in the layer and the value of the optical absorption edge, and the PL emission wavelength.
2062	The concept of parity in particle physics has been a topic of interest for many years. Parity is a fundamental property of particles that describes how they behave under mirror reflection. In this research paper, we explore the phenomenon of parity doubling in particle physics. Parity doubling is a theory that suggests that particles can exist in pairs, where one particle has positive parity and the other has negative parity. We analyze data from particle colliders to investigate whether this theory is supported by experimental evidence. Our results suggest that parity doubling may indeed be present in some particles, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential applications of parity doubling in particle physics.
2747	This research paper presents the results of multisite campaigns on two pulsating subdwarf B stars, PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. The aim of the study was to investigate the pulsation properties of these stars through photometric and spectroscopic observations. The analysis revealed several new pulsation modes in PG 1618+563B and confirmed the presence of previously identified modes in PG 0048+091. Additionally, the results showed that the pulsation properties of these stars are influenced by their atmospheric parameters. Overall, this study provides new insights into the pulsation properties of subdwarf B stars and highlights the importance of multisite campaigns in studying these objects.
1830	"We present Very Large Array observations at 7 millimeters wavelength that resolve the dust emission structure in the disk around the young star TW Hydrae at the scale of the ~4 AU (~0.16"") radius inner hole inferred from spectral energy distribution modeling. These high resolution data confirm directly the presence of an inner hole in the dust disk and reveal a high brightness ring that we associate with the directly illuminated inner edge of the disk. The clearing of the inner disk plausibly results from the dynamical effects of a giant planet in formation. In an appendix, we develop an analytical framework for the interpretation of visibility curves from power-law disk models with inner holes."
3431	The Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in order to impose incompressibility. Regularity of the solutions is ensured in several ways: First, the potentials are represented using a spectral basis which is analytic at the cylindrical axis. Second, the non-physical discontinuous boundary conditions at the cylindrical corners are smoothed using a polynomial approximation to a steep exponential profile. Third, the nonlinear term is evaluated in such a way as to eliminate singularities. The resulting pseudo-spectral code is tested using exact polynomial solutions and the spectral convergence of the coefficients is demonstrated. Our solutions are shown to agree with exact polynomial solutions and with previous axisymmetric calculations of vortex breakdown and of nonaxisymmetric calculations of onset of helical spirals. Parallelization by azimuthal wavenumber is shown to be highly effective.
3962	We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially, this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.
762	"This research paper is a continuation of the study of Swan conductors for p-adic differential modules. The main objective is to investigate the global variation of these conductors under certain conditions. The authors introduce the concept of a ""good family"" of p-adic differential modules, and prove that the Swan conductor varies continuously as the family varies over a suitable base. They also give explicit formulas for the variation of the Swan conductor in some special cases. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the study of p-adic L-functions and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Overall, this research provides important insights into the behavior of Swan conductors for p-adic differential modules, and sheds light on the connections between these conductors and other important objects in arithmetic geometry."
2480	"The research paper titled ""Aspects of Stochastic Resonance in Reaction-Diffusion Systems: The Nonequilibrium-Potential Approach"" investigates the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems. The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the nonequilibrium-potential approach, which allows for the examination of the role of noise in the system's behavior. They demonstrate that the presence of noise can enhance the system's response to external signals, leading to stochastic resonance. The study also explores the effects of different parameters, such as the system's size and the strength of the noise, on the occurrence and strength of stochastic resonance. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of how noise influences the behavior of complex systems and have implications for fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology."
3511	This research paper aims to investigate and model the long-term trends in lunar exposure to the Earth's plasmasheet. The plasmasheet is a region of the Earth's magnetosphere where plasma particles are trapped and accelerated by the Earth's magnetic field. These particles interact with the lunar surface, causing a range of effects, including surface charging, sputtering, and erosion. The study will use data from various spacecraft missions, including the Lunar Prospector and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, to model the plasmasheet's behavior over several decades. The research will provide insights into the long-term effects of the Earth's magnetosphere on the lunar surface, which could have implications for future lunar missions and exploration.
86	This research paper presents a study of the electrical conductivity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) using the 2PI effective action. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the impact of the effective action on the electrical conductivity of QED. The paper shows that the 2PI effective action method provides a more accurate description of the electrical conductivity in QED than other traditional approaches. The significant findings of the study include the calculation of the electric conductivity for a wide range of temperatures and densities and the observation of a novel plasma mode. The research concludes that the 2PI effective action is a powerful tool for exploring the electrical conductivity of QED and can provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly interacting systems.
1488	A two-staged, uniaxial magnetoresistive effect has been discovered in SrCo6O11 having a layered hexagonal structure. Conduction electrons and localized Ising spins are in different sublattices but their interpenetration makes the conduction electrons sensitively pick up the stepwise field-dependence of magnetization. The stepwise field-dependence suggests two competitive interlayer interactions between ferromagnetic Ising-spin layers, i.e., a ferromagnetic nearest-layer interaction and an antiferromagnetic next-nearest-layer interaction. This oxide offers a unique opportunity to study nontrivial interplay between conduction electrons and Ising spins, the coupling of which can be finely controlled by a magnetic field of a few Tesla.
688	This research paper investigates the potential of spin transport through Si for achieving high magnetocurrents. A novel device architecture is proposed, which is based on a Si channel with embedded CoFeB electrodes. The experimental results demonstrate a magnetocurrent of up to 35%, which is attributed to the spin injection and detection at the CoFeB/Si interface. The mechanism of spin transport is analyzed using the spin-transport model and the temperature-dependent measurements. The findings of this study provide insights into the fundamental understanding of spin transport in Si-based devices and offer a promising approach for future spintronics applications.
3040	This research paper explores the significance of wide field surveys in expanding our understanding of the astronomical discovery space.

2671	This research paper explores the preparation and detection of magnetic quantum phases in optical superlattices. The authors investigate the behavior of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice that is generated by interfering laser beams. Using a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, they demonstrate the emergence of a magnetic quantum phase with long-range order in the lattice. This phase is characterized by the appearance of a spin density wave, which can be detected using a variety of techniques. The authors conclude that optical superlattices offer a promising platform for studying magnetic quantum phases and could have potential applications in quantum information processing and sensing.
100	The research paper investigates the line tension and structure of smectic liquid crystal multilayers at the air-water interface. By using X-ray reflectivity and surface tensiometry, the authors found that the line tension is related to the thickness of the liquid crystal layers and their interactions with the interface. The multilayers exhibited a range of structures, including a well-ordered hexagonal lattice and a disordered smectic phase. The authors conclude that line tension plays a crucial role in the formation and stability of the multilayers, and their findings provide insight into the behavior of liquid crystal systems at interfaces.
3227	The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars, essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular, we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are due to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca process). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.
232	This paper presents a unified, purely affine theory of gravitation and electromagnetism, which extends the traditional Einstein-Cartan theory to include electromagnetic fields. The theory proposes a new Lagrangian density, which results in a set of field equations that unify the two fundamental forces. By applying the theory to various physical situations, we find that it accurately predicts the behavior of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The results suggest that a purely affine theory of gravity and electromagnetism can provide a more fundamental and comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of these forces.
924	This research paper investigates the role of instantons in the construction of hypermultiplets in the heterotic string theory. The authors explore the connection between the instanton number and the dimension of the hypermultiplets, and demonstrate that the instanton number is related to the number of zero modes of the Dirac operator. They also show that certain hypermultiplets can be constructed through the use of instantons, and discuss the implications of these findings for the heterotic string theory. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the relationship between instantons, hypermultiplets, and the heterotic string, and sheds light on the underlying structure of this fundamental aspect of theoretical physics.
380	"The research paper titled ""Tuning the conductance of a molecular switch"" investigates the conductance of a molecular switch, which is a key component of nanoelectronics. The researchers used a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental techniques to study the conductance of a specific molecular switch known as the D-A system. They found that the conductance of the D-A system can be tuned by changing the distance between the donor and acceptor groups within the molecule. Additionally, they found that the conductance of the D-A system is strongly influenced by the configuration of the molecule. Overall, the results of this study provide important insights into the design and optimization of molecular switches for use in future nanoelectronics."
D2-89	Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, covers 836,330 square miles in the North Atlantic, with approximately 80% of its surface covered by ice. An autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a population of about 56,000, predominantly Inuit. The capital, Nuuk, houses roughly one-third of its inhabitants. Despite its name, most of Greenland experiences Arctic conditions with limited vegetation. Its economy relies on fishing, tourism, and substantial mineral resources, including rare earth elements becoming increasingly valuable due to climate change. Greenlandic culture blends traditional Inuit practices with Scandinavian influences. Climate change poses significant challenges as the melting ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise while simultaneously opening new economic opportunities through increased resource accessibility.
105	It was presented by Cabello and Nakamura [A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 190401 (2003)], that the Kochen-Specker theorem applies to two dimensions if one uses Positive Operator-Valued Measures. We show that contextuality in their models is not of the Kochen-Specker type. It is rather the result of not keeping track of the whole system on which the measurement is performed. This is connected to the fact that there is no one-to-one correspondence between POVM elements and projectors on the extended Hilbert space and the same POVM element has to originate from two different projectors when used in Cabello's and Nakamura's models. Moreover, we propose a hidden-variable formulation of the above models.
1023	This research paper utilizes Quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the ring-shaped polariton parametric luminescence in a semiconductor microcavity. The study aims to understand the underlying physics of the phenomenon and to identify the key parameters that affect the emission characteristics. The results of the simulations reveal the dependence of the emission spectrum on the pump power and the cavity detuning, indicating the possibility of tuning the emission properties for potential applications in quantum information processing and communication. This work provides new insights into the physics of polariton parametric luminescence and paves the way for future experimental investigations.
3181	The paper discusses tautological relations in Hodge field theory, which relate the cohomology of algebraic varieties to the geometry of their moduli spaces. The authors provide a framework for understanding these relations and give examples of their applications in the study of algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture. They also establish new tautological relations and prove their relevance to the theory of motives. The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems and directions for future research in the field.
1926	The idea that substantial absorption in AGN could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of QSO evolution was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of X-ray absorbed AGN at z~1 to z~3, that have shown strong emission at 850 mkm. This strong emission is a signature of the copious star formation. In AGN evolution model, the main obscured growth phase of the QSO coincides with formation of the host galaxy spheroid, the completion of which indicates the beginning of the luminous, unobscured phase of the QSO's evolution. The verification of this model at redshifts up to z~6 appears possible via application of the gamma-ray resonant absorption method.
2377	"The research paper titled ""Magnetosonic solitons in a Fermionic quantum plasma"" explores the formation and behavior of magnetosonic solitons in a quantum plasma consisting of fermions. The study is based on theoretical calculations and simulations using the quantum hydrodynamic equations. The research found that the presence of fermions in the plasma has a significant impact on the formation and propagation of magnetosonic solitons. The results showed that the solitons have a lower amplitude and a wider distribution compared to those in a classical plasma. Additionally, the solitons exhibit particle-like behavior, suggesting that they can be considered as quasiparticles in the quantum plasma. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of magnetosonic solitons in quantum plasmas and could have implications for future research in areas such as astrophysics and fusion energy."
2324	This research paper presents a study on the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices at non-zero temperatures. The primary focus is on investigating the effects of temperature on the decay of superfluid turbulence. The study utilized numerical simulations and analytical calculations to explore the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices. The remarkable findings include the prediction of a critical temperature for the onset of the decay of superfluid turbulence and the observation of a decrease in vortex line density with increasing temperature. The conclusions suggest that temperature plays a critical role in the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices and should be considered in future studies of superfluid turbulence.
2339	We define a wave-function for string theory cosmological backgrounds. We give a prescription for computing its norm following an earlier analysis within general relativity. Under Euclidean continuation, the cosmologies we discuss in this paper are described in terms of compact parafermionic worldsheet systems. To define the wave-function we provide a T-fold description of the parafermionic conformal field theory, and of the corresponding string cosmology. In specific examples, we compute the norm of the wave-function and comment on its behavior as a function of moduli.
3932	We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.
1497	This research paper investigates the achievable rates for two-way wire-tap channels, where two legitimate users communicate with each other in the presence of an eavesdropper. We analyze the secrecy capacity of these channels and derive upper and lower bounds on the achievable rates. The paper also presents numerical results for various channel models and compares the performance of different transmission schemes. Our findings show that the achievable rates for two-way wire-tap channels heavily depend on the channel conditions and the transmission strategies employed. The results can be useful in designing secure communication systems for practical applications.
2268	It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.
3394	Results are presented for the leading two-loop contributions of O(alpha_t alpha_s) to the masses and mixing effects in the Higgs sector of the MSSM with complex parameters. They are obtained in the Feynman-diagrammatic approach using on-shell renormalization. The full dependence on all complex phases is taken into account. The renormalization of the appropriate contributions of the Higgs-boson sector and the scalar top and bottom sector is discussed. Our numerical analysis for the lightest MSSM Higgs-boson mass is based on the new two-loop corrections, supplemented by the full one-loop result. The corrections induced by the phase variation in the scalar top sector are enhanced by the two-loop contributions. We find that the corresponding shift in M_h1 can amount to 5 GeV.

1061	Black hole (BH) oscillations known as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are one of the most important gravitational wave (GW) sources. We propose that higher perturbative order of QNMs, generated by nonlinear gravitational interaction near the BHs, are detectable and worth searching for in observations and simulations of binary BH mergers. We calculate the metric perturbations to second-order and explicitly regularize the master equation at the horizon and spatial infinity. We find that the second-order QNMs have frequencies twice the first-order ones and the GW amplitude is up to ~10% that of the first-order one. The QNM frequency would also shift blueward up to ~1%. This provides a new test of general relativity as well as a possible distance indicator.
2152	Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.

D1-2	The cell cycle is the process by which a cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and divides into two daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and reproduction. The cycle consists of four main phases. In G₁ phase, the cell grows, produces proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. During the S phase, DNA is replicated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy. The G2 phase follows, where the cell continues growing and checks for DNA damage before proceeding to division. Finally, in the M phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where chromosomes are separated, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits.

3484	We consider a network of nodes distributed in physical space without physical links communicating through message broadcasting over specified distances. Typically, communication using smaller distances is desirable due to savings in energy or other resources. We introduce a network formation mechanism to enable reducing the distances while retaining connectivity. Nodes, which initially transmit signals at a prespecified maximum distance, subject links to preferential detachment by autonomously decreasing their transmission radii while satisfying conditions of zero communication loss and fixed maximum node-hopping distance for signaling. Applied to networks with various spatial topologies, we find cost reductions as high as 90% over networks that are restricted to have all nodes with equal transmission distance.

2222	The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response to stimuli.

793	The stock market has been known to form homogeneous stock groups with a higher correlation among different stocks according to common economic factors that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of common economic factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors.
1663	Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to measure the density of heavy water contained in 1-D cylindrical pores of mesoporous silica material MCM-41-S-15, with pores of diameter of 15+-1 A. In these pores the homogenous nucleation process of bulk water at 235 K does not occur and the liquid can be supercooled down to at least 160 K. The analysis of SANS data allows us to determine the absolute value of the density of D2O as a function of temperature. We observe a density minimum at 210+-5 K with a value of 1.041+-0.003 g/cm3. We show that the results are consistent with the predictions of molecular dynamics simulations of supercooled bulk water. This is the first experimental report of the existence of the density minimum in supercooled water.
267	The finite temperature phase transition of strongly interacting matter is studied within a nonlocal chiral quark model of the NJL type coupled to a Polyakov loop. In contrast to previous investigations which were restricted to the mean-field approximation, mesonic correlations are included by evaluating the quark-antiquark ring sum. For physical pion masses, we find that the pions dominate the pressure below the phase transition, whereas above T_c the pressure is well described by the mean-field approximation result. For large pion masses, as realized in lattice simulations, the meson effects are suppressed.

The study provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of copolymer-homopolymer blends for various industrial applications.
1703	OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of remnant-cloud interaction. We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36 supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of fractal geometry in understanding accretion processes and suggests new avenues for future research.
1241	For general quantum systems the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions in relation to the ergodic properties of the underlying classical system is quite difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way, thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set of quantum limits in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as quantum limits, and examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely continuous ergodic measures can occur as quantum limits. The maps we quantise are obtained by cutting and stacking.

1882	The widely used large-scale diagonalization method using harmonic oscillator basis functions (an instance of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, also called a spectral method, configuration-interaction method, or ``exact diagonalization'' method) is systematically analyzed using results for the convergence of Hermite function series. We apply this theory to a Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional model of a quantum dot. The method is shown to converge slowly, and the non-smooth character of the interaction potential is identified as the main problem with the chosen basis, while on the other hand its important advantages are pointed out. An effective interaction obtained by a similarity transformation is proposed for improving the convergence of the diagonalization scheme, and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the improvement. Generalizations to more particles and dimensions are discussed.

3653	The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.

The role of strain is discussed on the basis of explicit calculations of bound hole states.
1546	A spherically symmetrical ultra-relativistic blast wave is not an attractor of a generic asymmetric explosion. Spherical symmetry is reached only by the time the blast wave slows down to non-relativistic velocities, when the Sedov-Taylor-von Neumann attractor solution sets in. We show however, that a directed relativistic explosion, with the explosion momentum close to the explosion energy, produces a blast wave with a universal intermediate asymptotic -- a selfsimilar directed ultra-relativistic blast wave. This universality might be of interest for the astrophysics of gamma-ray burst afterglows.

The results reveal that the charging energy of the quantum dot is significantly influenced by the coupling strength and the Luttinger parameter of the leads. Furthermore, the study indicates that the charging process can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage and the magnetic field. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the physics of charge transport in quantum dot systems and can be useful in the development of future quantum devices.
2420	We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the status of fundamental physics law.
2661	The Gutzwiller description of non-magnetic Mott insulators is a widely used approach to understand the electronic behavior of strongly correlated materials. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Gutzwiller formalism to a dimer lattice model of non-magnetic Mott insulators. We demonstrate that the Gutzwiller approximation is a powerful tool for analyzing the electronic structure and properties of such systems. Specifically, we show that the Gutzwiller approximation can be used to accurately describe the metal-insulator transition in the dimer lattice model and to predict the behavior of the system in the presence of external perturbations. Our results highlight the potential of the Gutzwiller approach for studying Mott insulators in a variety of materials and contexts.
D2-44	To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics

Overall, this research provides insights into the self-compensation mechanism in Cd0.95Zn0.05Te:Cl crystals and its potential applications in the development of novel semiconductor materials.
618	The polarization splitting of the exciton ground state in two laterally coupled quantum dots under an in-plane electric field is investigated and its effective tuning is designed. It is found that there are significant Stark effect and anticrossing in energy levels. Due to coupling between inter- and intra-dot states, the absolute value of polarization splitting is significantly reduced, and it could be tuned to zero by the electric field for proper inter-dot separations. Our scheme is interesting for the research on the quantum dots-based entangled-photon source.
1071	A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom interactions.
1985	Average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions is proposed as a diagnostic probe of high density (saturation) physics. We show that by introducing and varying a transverse momentum cutoff in the definition of the average transverse momentum, one can eliminate the uncertainty in the overall magnitude of the leading order hadron production cross section in high energy collisions, and semi-quantitatively map the different dynamical regions predicted by the saturation physics. We discuss the applications of this method to pion production at RHIC and LHC and make quantitative predictions for the average transverse momentum of produced pions in the kinematics appropriate for the RHIC and LHC experiments.

1986	This research paper investigates the use of the average transverse momentum ($p_t$) as a probe of high energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dynamics. By analyzing experimental data from high energy proton-proton collisions, we demonstrate that the average $p_t$ is sensitive to the underlying QCD processes that govern the production of particles in these collisions. Specifically, we find that the behavior of the average $p_t$ is consistent with the predictions of perturbative QCD at high $p_t$, while at lower $p_t$ it deviates from this behavior, indicating the presence of non-perturbative effects. Our results provide a valuable tool for probing the fundamental nature of QCD at high energies and offer new insights into the behavior of particle production in high energy collisions.
3743	We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.

The proposed method is also shown to be robust to noise and highly interpretable. In conclusion, the paper offers a promising approach for feature selection in supervised learning tasks.
2120	"By making use of the finite-temperature real-time static potential that was introduced and computed to leading non-trivial order in Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory in recent work, and solving numerically a Schr\""odinger-type equation, we estimate the quarkonium (in practice, bottomonium) contribution to the spectral function of the electromagnetic current in hot QCD. The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which becomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450 MeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice reconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'', which generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our results on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on the baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma."

We discuss technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit boards we developed.
3843	I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.

These findings have important implications for the development and implementation of autonomous traffic systems in urban environments, including potential benefits for reducing congestion and improving safety.
2408	In this paper, photonic entanglement and interference are described and analyzed with the language of quantum information process. Correspondingly, a photon state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a new expression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression, each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operations on photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is well interpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement between different degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric down conversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photon state. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interference visibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.
3435	We study the constraints imposed by the Hadamard condition on the two-point function of local states of a scalar quantum field conformally coupled to a gravitational background. We propose a method to assign a stress tensor to the state-dependent part of the two point function which arises as a conserved tensor with an anomalous trace. To characterize the local Hadamard states of physical interest we apply a super-selection rule relating this quantum stress tensor to the matter stress tensor of a conformal invariant gravitational model subject to a conformal symmetry breaking term. This implies that the determination of a Hadamard state may be considered as an integral part of its gravitational coupling via the back-reaction effect.
536	This paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares. Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method.
944	We demonstrate that partner symmetries provide a lift of noninvariant solutions of three-dimensional Boyer-Finley equation to noninvariant solutions of four-dimensional hyperbolic complex Monge-Ampere equation. The lift is applied to noninvariant solutions of the Boyer-Finley equation, obtained earlier by the method of group foliation, to yield noninvariant solutions of the hyperbolic complex Monge-Ampere equation. Using these solutions we construct new Ricci-flat ultra-hyperbolic metrics with non-zero curvature tensor that have no Killing vectors.

103	We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2) plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not observe the sustained growth.

Overall, the paper provides insights into the potential benefits of algorithm synthesis and highlights its relevance in modern computing systems.
2902	Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinear optical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has the potential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics in semiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best be understood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates. However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated by solving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result in a quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressions for the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directions and use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formal connection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons (soft-core bosons) is pointed out.
3160	Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to D2h then to C2h.
2483	A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the Hubble scale at the transition.

The analysis reveals that the theory's predictions are consistent with the current experimental data. Furthermore, the study shows that the MBD theory can provide an alternative explanation for the dark matter and dark energy problems. The outcomes of this research have significant implications for the understanding of gravity and the universe's evolution.

2329	We propose a definition for analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds. This is given by the derivative at zero of a well-chosen combination of zeta functions of a fourth-order modified Rumin Laplacian. The regular value at zero (before differentiation) of this well-chosen combination of zeta functions is shown to be a contact invariant. The variation of our analytic torsion is given as the integral of local terms, together with a global term coming from the null-space of the Laplacian.
367	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of effective attraction induced by repulsive interaction in a spin-transfer system. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this counterintuitive behavior arises due to the interplay between spin-transfer torque and interparticle repulsion.

This study highlights the importance of considering repulsive interactions in understanding the behavior of spin-transfer systems and provides a new avenue for controlling their dynamics.

The study also reveals that the deformation mechanisms of the nanotubes vary with temperature. Conclusively, the findings have significant implications for the design and development of nanotube-based materials for high-temperature applications.
2808	This research paper investigates the effect of the solar corona on small-amplitude prominence oscillations. The study focuses on the longitudinal magnetic field and concludes that the presence of the corona causes attenuation of these oscillations.

These findings have implications for the understanding of the dynamics of prominences and the structure of the solar corona.
1496	We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, (GTW-WT), and the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, (BATW-WT). It is shown that the two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel (GMAC-WT) to illustrate this advantage.

3600	We define the alternating sign matrix polytope as the convex hull of nxn alternating sign matrices and prove its equivalent description in terms of inequalities. This is analogous to the well known result of Birkhoff and von Neumann that the convex hull of the permutation matrices equals the set of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices. We count the facets and vertices of the alternating sign matrix polytope and describe its projection to the permutohedron as well as give a complete characterization of its face lattice in terms of modified square ice configurations. Furthermore we prove that the dimension of any face can be easily determined from this characterization.
D2-64	Spermidine synthase (SpdS) is an enzyme responsible for producing spermidine, a polyamine essential for cell growth and proliferation. It typically exists as a homodimer or monomer, depending on the species, and has a Rossmann-like fold common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The enzyme’s active site binds putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), with key aspartate and glutamate residues facilitating catalysis. During the reaction, SpdS transfers an aminopropyl group from dcSAM to putrescine, forming spermidine and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). This process plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis, stress response, and DNA stabilization. The enzyme ensures efficient polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular function and growth.
2860	The hyperfine structure of highly-charged ions is investigated using laser spectroscopy, aiming to test the validity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in high fields.

The results are compared with QED predictions, and any deviations from the theory are analyzed. This research provides important insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions and could have implications for fundamental physics and technology applications.
1543	The helix-coil phase transition is a fundamental process in protein folding that remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present an ab initio theoretical study of the helix-coil transition using molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that this transition is governed by a delicate balance of enthalpic and entropic contributions, with the former dominated by hydrogen bonding and the latter by conformational entropy. We further demonstrate that the transition is strongly dependent on the sequence and length of the helical segment, with longer and more hydrophobic helices exhibiting a greater propensity to form stable helical structures. Our findings shed new light on the underlying thermodynamics of protein folding and may have important implications for the design of new foldable peptides and proteins.

We investigate the behavior of partition functions in the presence of random fluctuations and derive asymptotic estimates for the probability of large deviations. Our results demonstrate that the large deviation principle plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of these models in the thermodynamic limit. We apply our findings to several specific models and provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical results. Our research sheds light on the fundamental properties of directed polymers and related models, and may have important implications for a wide range of physical and mathematical applications.
348	We find actual evidence, relying upon vorticity time series taken in a high Reynolds number atmospheric experiment, that to a very good approximation the surface boundary layer flow may be described, in a statistical sense and under certain regimes, as an advected ensemble of homogeneous turbulent systems, characterized by a lognormal distribution of fluctuating intensities. Our analysis suggests that usual direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, may play an important role in the study of turbulent boundary layer flows, if supplemented with appropriate statistical information concerned with the structure of large scale fluctuations.

Noteworthy results include a positive correlation between the number of publications and the number of citations received, as well as a concentration of research collaboration within specific geographic regions. The study concludes that bibliometric analysis can provide valuable insights into the research performance of universities, which can inform policy decisions and resource allocation.
921	Quantum mechanics is formulated as a geometric theory on a Hilbert manifold. Images of charts on the manifold are allowed to belong to arbitrary Hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions. Tensor equations in this setting, also called functional tensor equations, describe families of functional equations on various Hilbert spaces of functions. The principle of functional relativity is introduced which states that quantum theory is indeed a functional tensor theory, i.e., it can be described by functional tensor equations. The main equations of quantum theory are shown to be compatible with the principle of functional relativity. By accepting the principle as a hypothesis, we then analyze the origin of physical dimensions, provide a geometric interpretation of Planck's constant, and find a simple interpretation of the two-slit experiment and the process of measurement.
3139	The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps. Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved.

959	This research paper focuses on the direct optimization of ranking measures, which are widely used in information retrieval and machine learning applications. The paper proposes a new optimization framework that directly optimizes ranking measures, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, without the need for surrogate loss functions. The proposed method is based on a novel gradient descent algorithm that updates the ranking model parameters in a way that directly improves the ranking measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets for information retrieval and machine learning tasks. These results suggest that the proposed method can provide a more effective and efficient approach to optimizing ranking measures in various applications.
1390	This research paper explores the concept of higher-order theories and their application in cognitive science and philosophy of mind. Higher-order theories posit that conscious mental states are those that are accompanied by higher-order thoughts or beliefs about those mental states. The paper examines the historical background and various formulations of higher-order theories, including the debate between first-order and higher-order theories. It also considers the implications of higher-order theories for understanding consciousness, self-awareness, and the relationship between mental states and brain states. The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of higher-order theories and directions for future research.
1095	We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of data warehouses. Benchmarking is useful either to system users for comparing the performances of different systems, or to system engineers for testing the effect of various design choices. While the TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council) standard benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the second one. Our Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized. However, two levels of parameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineering benchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and not a competitor. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management systems.
290	This research paper presents an enhanced negative type for finite metric trees that captures the main focus of the study.

The study uses a combination of theoretical analysis and computational experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced negative type. The results show that the enhanced negative type leads to a more precise characterization of the metric structure of trees, and can be used to improve algorithms in various applications. Overall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of metric geometry and offers insights for further investigations into the structure of finite metric trees.
3896	This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex. The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
3249	We examine resonances for two systems consisting of a particle coupled to a massless boson's field. The field is the free field in the whole space. In the first system, the particle is confined inside a ball. We show that besides the usual energy levels of the particle, which have become complex through the coupling to the field, other resonances are to be taken into account if the ball's radius is comparable to the particle's Compton wavelength. In the second system, the particle is in a finite-depth square-well potential. We study the way the resonances' width depends on the extent of the uncoupled particle's wave functions. In both cases, we limit ourselves to considering two levels of the particle only.

These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the algebraic structures underlying knot theory and provide insights into the representation theory of other related algebras.
1690	The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and discussed from several different perspectives: (i) stability of motion against external perturbations and decoherence, (ii) efficiency of quantum simulation in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator spaces, (iii) quantum transport, relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing, and (iv) computation of quantum dynamical entropies. Discussions of all these criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or quantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some conjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many problem are suggested.

43	A recent radio survey of globular clusters has increased the number of millisecond pulsars drastically. M28 is now the globular cluster with the third largest population of known pulsars, after Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc.

Fractional diffusion equations have recently gained attention in various fields due to their ability to model anomalous diffusion processes. In this paper, we investigate the probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations and compare them to those generated by classical diffusion equations.

The paper concludes that conservation efforts should focus not only on currently endangered species but also on those with high potential for future contributions to phylogenetic diversity."
1462	This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier.

3663	This research paper focuses on the convergence of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and presents an extrapolation technique to improve its accuracy. The DDA is widely used to model electromagnetic scattering from particles, but it suffers from slow convergence, particularly for large and highly absorbing particles. In this paper, we propose an extrapolation technique that combines results from DDA simulations with different grid sizes, enabling us to achieve higher accuracy with a lower computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by comparing the results with reference solutions for several test cases. Our results show that the extrapolation technique significantly improves the convergence rate of the DDA, leading to more accurate and efficient simulations. This technique has potential applications in various fields, including atmospheric and environmental sciences, material science, and biomedical engineering.

3121	We construct a class of analytic solutions of WZW-type open superstring field theory describing marginal deformations of a reference D-brane background. The deformations we consider are generated by on-shell vertex operators with vanishing operator products. The superstring solution exhibits an intriguing duality with the corresponding marginal solution of the {\it bosonic} string. In particular, the superstring problem is ``dual'' to the problem of re-expressing the bosonic marginal solution in pure gauge form. This represents the first nonsingular analytic solution of open superstring field theory.
D2-15	There are an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the known Universe, some will hold millions and others will hold billions of stars. Most of the stars will have various amounts of planets in orbit around them and trillions of those planets will be in the Goldilocks Zone, which is an area in space that has the right conditions for liquid water to exist. So the logical thing you might say is “There must be life on some of them”. Maybe some other intelligent life form on a faraway world is asking that same question. If we are alone that would make us more special and unique than we could ever imagine.

1977	Bragg spectroscopy is used to measure excitations of a trapped, quantum-degenerate gas of 87Rb atoms in a 3-dimensional optical lattice. The measurements are carried out over a range of optical lattice depths in the superfluid phase of the Bose-Hubbard model. For fixed wavevector, the resonant frequency of the excitation is found to decrease with increasing lattice depth. A numerical calculation of the resonant frequencies based on Bogoliubov theory shows a less steep rate of decrease than the measurements.

The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of light logics and optimal reductions, showing that they are both NP-complete. These results have significant implications for the development of efficient algorithms for propositional logic and related fields.

They find that the flavor composition is consistent with theoretical predictions and that the energy spectrum follows a power law distribution. Additionally, the authors discuss the implications of these results for understanding the sources and mechanisms of astrophysical neutrinos. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the properties of these elusive particles and their role in astrophysical processes.
1814	The spectrum of large radius exciton in an individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is described within the framework of elementary potential model, in which exciton is modeled as bound state of two oppositely charged quasi-particles confined on the tube surface. Due to the parity of the interaction potential the exciton states split into the odd and even series. It is shown that for the bare and screened Coulomb electron-hole (e-h) potentials the binding energy of even excitons in the ground state well exceeds the energy gap. The factors preventing the collapse of single-electron states in isolated semiconducting SWCNTs are discussed.
3662	We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.

2496	We point out that it is possible to associate the electroweak Higgs boson with the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, thus resolving the hierarchy problem in a technically natural way. We illustrate this idea with two specific gauge models. Besides being consistent with all currently available experimental data, both models maintain the predictive power of the standard model, since the first model has only one additional parameter beyond the standard model, and the second has the same number of free parameters as the standard model.

3862	We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions.

3585	This research paper explores the potential role of quantum interference and superposition in cognitive processes, and develops a theory for the disjunction of concepts. Through a review of existing literature and a synthesis of relevant concepts from quantum mechanics and cognitive psychology, this paper proposes that the disjunction of concepts may be explained by quantum interference and superposition. The theory suggests that the human mind may be capable of processing multiple, contradictory concepts simultaneously, leading to more creative and flexible thinking. The potential implications of this theory for fields such as education, problem-solving, and decision-making are discussed. Overall, this paper offers a novel perspective on the cognitive processes underlying concept formation and disjunction, and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in understanding the complex nature of the human mind.
1401	Feature tracking and recognition are increasingly common tools for data analysis, but are typically implemented on an ad-hoc basis by individual research groups, limiting the usefulness of derived results when selection effects and algorithmic differences are not controlled. Specific results that are affected include the solar magnetic turnover time, the distributions of sizes, strengths, and lifetimes of magnetic features, and the physics of both small scale flux emergence and the small-scale dynamo. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed comparison between four tracking codes applied to a single set of data from SOHO/MDI, describe the interplay between desired tracking behavior and parameterization of tracking algorithms, and make recommendations for feature selection and tracking practice in future work.
493	We study the growth of a directed transportation network, such as a food web, in which links carry resources. We propose a growth process in which new nodes (or species) preferentially attach to existing nodes with high indegree (in food-web language, number of prey) and low outdegree (or number of predators). This scheme, which we call inverse preferential attachment, is intended to maximize the amount of resources available to each new node. We show that the outdegree (predator) distribution decays at least exponentially fast for large outdegree and is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a delta function. The indegree (prey) distribution is poissonian in the large-network limit.
900	One of the main open questions in liaison theory is whether every homogeneous Cohen-Macaulay ideal in a polynomial ring is glicci, i.e. if it is in the G-liaison class of a complete intersection. We give an affirmative answer to this question for Stanley-Reisner ideals defined by simplicial complexes that are weakly vertex-decomposable. This class of complexes includes matroid, shifted and Gorenstein complexes respectively. Moreover, we construct a simplicial complex which shows that the property of being glicci depends on the characteristic of the base field. As an application of our methods we establish new evidence for two conjectures of Stanley on partitionable complexes and on Stanley decompositions.

The paper concludes that the wavelet transform method is a promising technique for modal analysis in spatially extended systems, and it can be used to improve the accuracy of structural models for various applications."
D1-22	Artificial sweeteners are low- or zero-calorie sugar substitutes used to sweeten foods and beverages without the added calories of sugar. Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (a natural alternative). They are widely used in diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and diabetic-friendly products. While they provide sweetness without spiking blood sugar levels, they remain controversial. Studies show they are safe in moderation, but concerns exist about potential long-term effects on gut health and metabolism. Some people experience sensitivity to specific sweeteners. Ultimately, artificial sweeteners can be helpful for reducing calorie intake, but their impact varies widely from person to person.

3223	Efficiently computing fast paths in large scale dynamic road networks (where dynamic traffic information is known over a part of the network) is a practical problem faced by several traffic information service providers who wish to offer a realistic fast path computation to GPS terminal enabled vehicles. The heuristic solution method we propose is based on a highway hierarchy-based shortest path algorithm for static large-scale networks; we maintain a static highway hierarchy and perform each query on the dynamically evaluated network.
1216	The research paper investigates the ground states of fermionic mixtures with mass imbalance in optical lattices. The study reveals that there are competing superfluid and density-wave ground states in such systems, and the nature of the ground state strongly depends on the mass imbalance and interaction strength. The researchers have used various theoretical methods, including mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, to obtain their results. The study provides insights into the behavior of fermionic mixtures in optical lattices and could have implications for the design of future experiments in this field.
1592	This research paper discusses the creation of supersonic radiatively cooled rotating flows and jets in laboratory conditions. The study found that by using a combination of supersonic gas expansion and radiative cooling, it was possible to generate stable, rotating flows and jets at supersonic speeds. The researchers also found that the addition of rotation to the flow improved the stability and reduced the mixing of the flow with the surrounding gas. These findings have potential applications in fields such as astrophysics and aerospace engineering.
3397	This research paper investigates the effect of a fluctuating cutoff on the inflationary spectra. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the cutoff is subject to stochastic fluctuations that could introduce damped corrections to the spectra. We use the stochastic inflationary model to explore this scenario and derive the corresponding equations that govern the dynamics of the cutoff and the spectra. Our analysis shows that the fluctuations in the cutoff can indeed lead to damped corrections to the spectra, which could have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind these corrections and explore their dependence on the parameters of the model. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the cutoff fluctuations could help improve our ability to extract information about the early universe from observational data.
4027	We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases accessible from it.
2030	This research paper focuses on measuring the energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using Compton scattering in PoGOLite. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the polarization properties of soft gamma-rays and their dependence on energy. The paper discusses the experimental setup and data analysis techniques used to measure the polarization in the energy range of 25-80 keV. The results show that the polarization fraction increases with energy, and the polarization angle is consistent with the expected value for Compton scattering. The study concludes that PoGOLite is a promising instrument for measuring polarization in soft gamma-rays.
3330	We introduce a new spinfoam vertex to be used in models of 4d quantum gravity based on SU(2) and SO(4) BF theory plus constraints. It can be seen as the conventional vertex of SU(2) BF theory, the 15j symbol, in a particular basis constructed using SU(2) coherent states. This basis makes the geometric interpretation of the variables transparent: they are the vectors normal to the triangles within each tetrahedron. We study the condition under which these states can be considered semiclassical, and we show that the semiclassical ones dominate the evaluation of quantum correlations. Finally, we describe how the constraints reducing BF to gravity can be directly written in terms of the new variables, and how the semiclassicality of the states might improve understanding the correct way to implement the constraints.

2307	"The research paper titled ""Inferring periodic orbits from spectra of simple shaped micro-lasers"" explores a method to infer the periodic orbits of micro-lasers by analyzing their spectra. The researchers studied two types of micro-lasers, one with a square shape and the other with a circular shape, and used a numerical model to simulate their behavior. By analyzing the spectra of the micro-lasers, they were able to accurately infer the periodic orbits of the lasers.

1982	The objective of this research paper was to investigate the transport properties of graphene across a tunable potential barrier. The study was conducted by fabricating a graphene p-n junction device and applying a gate voltage to manipulate the potential barrier. The main findings of the study showed that the transmission probability across the barrier was highly dependent on the height and width of the barrier, as well as the energy of the incoming electrons. Additionally, the researchers observed that the conductance of the device exhibited a characteristic peak as the potential barrier was tuned, which can be attributed to resonant tunneling of electrons through the barrier. Overall, the research highlights the potential of graphene p-n junction devices as tunable barriers for controlling electron transport in nanoelectronics applications.
282	In planar nano-magnetic devices magnetization direction is kept close to a given plane by the large easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, for example by the shape anisotropy in a thin film. In this case magnetization shows effectively in-plane dynamics with only one angle required for its description. Moreover, the motion can become overdamped even for small values of Gilbert damping. We derive the equations of effective in-plane dynamics in the presence of spin-transfer torques. The simplifications achieved in the overdamped regime allow to study systems with several dynamic magnetic pieces (``free layers''). A transition from a spin-transfer device with a static polarizer to a device with two equivalent magnets is observed. When the size difference between the magnets is less than critical, the device does not exhibit switching, but goes directly into the ``windmill'' precession state.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the surface pattern geometry significantly affects ion condensation, resulting in different ion distributions and charge screening behaviors. Our findings suggest that the ability to control the pattern geometry can provide a powerful tool for tuning ion condensation and charge screening properties on patterned surfaces. Additionally, we show that the ion condensation behavior is also affected by the ion concentration, surface charge density, and temperature. These results have relevant implications for designing surfaces with tailored ion transport properties and for understanding the behavior of biological membranes and ion channels.

1419	Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), being capable of beating PNS attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently. But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit error rate (QBER) increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility (99%) long period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom (1550 nm) wavelength. This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity protocol.

1721	"This research paper titled ""Fundamentalist physics: why Dark Energy is bad for Astronomy"" argues that the concept of Dark Energy, a theoretical form of energy that explains the accelerating expansion of the universe, is problematic for astronomy. The authors contend that the existence of Dark Energy is based on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, which may not be a valid assumption. They further argue that the use of Dark Energy as a fundamental concept in physics limits our ability to explore alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. The paper concludes that the field of astronomy needs to be more open to alternative theories and perspectives to advance our understanding of the universe."
1068	"The research paper titled ""Towards observable signatures of other bubble universes"" explores the possibility of detecting other universes beyond our own. The paper argues that if our universe is just one of many bubbles in a larger multiverse, there should be some observable consequences that could be detected. The authors propose several possible methods for detecting these signatures, including looking for variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation and searching for evidence of collisions between our universe and others. The paper concludes that while detecting other universes is a challenging task, the search for observable signatures is an important direction for future research in cosmology."
