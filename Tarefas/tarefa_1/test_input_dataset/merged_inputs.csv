2254	The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.
3458	This research paper focuses on the uniqueness and non-uniqueness of chains on half lines. In particular, the study investigates the conditions under which a chain on a half line is unique or non-unique. The paper employs a rigorous mathematical analysis to explore various scenarios that may lead to either uniqueness or non-uniqueness of chains. The findings of this research have significant applications in several fields, including physics, engineering, and mathematics. This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of chains on half lines, which can aid in the development of more accurate models and simulations in various applications.
3898	We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
1848	This research paper investigates the use of multiple quantum wells (MQWs) for generating ultra-short passive laser pulses. The main focus of the study is to analyze the impact of various parameters on the pulse generation process, including well width, barrier height, and doping concentration. The results show that well-designed MQWs can significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of laser pulse generation, leading to higher output power and shorter pulse duration. The study also highlights the importance of optimizing the design parameters to achieve the desired pulse characteristics. Overall, the findings suggest that MQWs hold great potential for advancing ultra-short pulse laser technology and its applications in various fields.
442	This research paper presents the first measurements of proper motions of thin dust filaments located in the Galactic Center region. Using data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, the authors were able to track the motion of these filaments over a period of 5-7 years. They found that the filaments exhibit significant proper motions, with some moving at speeds of up to 100 km/s. The authors suggest that these motions are likely due to the influence of the central supermassive black hole. Additionally, they observed that the filaments are not stationary, but instead exhibit complex, wavy structures. These findings provide important insights into the dynamics of the Galactic Center region and the role of filaments in shaping it.
752	This research paper explores the structure of the quenched QCD vacuum using overlap fermions. The primary theme of the study is to understand the properties of the vacuum in terms of topological objects like instantons and monopoles. The findings suggest that the overlap fermions can accurately capture the topological properties of the vacuum and provide a useful tool for studying the QCD vacuum structure. The study also concludes that the topological charge density distribution of the vacuum is highly non-uniform and dominated by instantons and anti-instantons. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the structure of the QCD vacuum and its role in understanding the properties of hadrons.
2775	This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission (PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.
383	Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the universe, consisting of hundreds or thousands of galaxies held together by gravity. The study of these clusters is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the universe. However, accurately measuring the physical properties of these clusters is challenging due to the complexity of their interactions. In particular, the fitting of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect models for galaxy clusters, known as the Beta-Model Problem, has yielded conflicting results. This research paper aims to explore and address the incompatibility of these models and propose a solution for more accurate measurements of galaxy cluster properties. The paper will review current research and present new findings on the nature of the Beta-Model Problem, discussing the implications for the study of galaxy clusters and the broader field of astrophysics.
2415	"The research paper titled ""Universal spectrum for DNA base CG frequency distribution in Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) genome"" explores the frequency distribution of the DNA base CG in the genome of Takifugu rubripes. The study employs a universal scaling analysis to investigate the genomic distribution of CG base pairs. The findings reveal that the CG frequency distribution follows a universal power-law distribution with an exponent of -1.7, which is consistent across different scales and chromosomes. This suggests that there is a fundamental organizational principle underlying the genomic distribution of CG base pairs in Takifugu rubripes. The study's results may have implications for understanding the evolutionary and functional aspects of genome organization in other species."
768	This research paper explores the relationship between cosmology and semi-conservation of computations in the universe. The main focus is to investigate if the universe is capable of semi-conserving computations, which could have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe. The study employs both theoretical and empirical techniques to analyze this issue. It finds that the universe may indeed be semi-conserving computations, which could have significant consequences for our understanding of the universe's origin and evolution. The study highlights the need for further research in this area to fully comprehend the implications of these findings.
185	"The research paper titled ""Dynamic Clustering in Object-Oriented Databases: An Advocacy for Simplicity"" focuses on the use of dynamic clustering techniques in object-oriented databases (OODBs). The study argues for the importance of simplicity in dynamic clustering as opposed to complex and computationally intensive techniques. The paper presents an experimental evaluation of three clustering methods: k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering. The results show that the simpler k-means method outperforms the other two in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The study concludes that simplicity should be a key consideration in the selection of clustering techniques for OODBs."
3213	The 6.4 day classical Cepheid AW Per is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 40 years. Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November 2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although we currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the success of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination, sini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs. Since the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the combination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit would give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby providing a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.
1143	This research paper investigates the impact of cosmic-ray events on the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) background. IACTs are used to detect very high-energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources, but they are also sensitive to cosmic-ray events that can mimic gamma-ray signals. The study uses Monte Carlo simulations to model the cosmic-ray background in IACTs and evaluates the impact of different analysis techniques and detector configurations. The results show that cosmic-ray events can significantly affect the sensitivity of IACTs to gamma rays, and that careful background modeling and analysis techniques are crucial for obtaining accurate gamma-ray measurements. The study highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of cosmic-ray background in IACT observations and provides useful insights for optimizing future gamma-ray telescope designs.
638	In this study, using the analytical and recurrence relations suggested by the authors in previous works, the new efficient and reliable program procedure for the overlap integrals over Slater type orbitals (STOs) is presented. The proposed procedure guarantees a highly accurate evaluation of the overlap integrals with arbitrary values of quantum numbers, screening constants and internuclear distances. It is demonstrated that the computational accuracy of the proposed procedure is not only dependent on the efficiency of formulas, as has been discussed previously, but also on a number of other factors including the used program language package and solvent properties. The numerical results obtained using the algorithm described in the present work are in a complete agreement with those obtained using the alternative evaluation procedure. We notice that the program works without any restrictions and in all range of integral parameters.
2297	This paper aims to explore the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system, which has been a longstanding challenge in quantum mechanics. The measurement process in quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical mechanics, and the problem of how to reconcile the two has been subject to much debate. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the measurement process in a two-level quantum system, including the role of the wave function collapse and the various interpretations of quantum mechanics. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the measurement problem for the broader field of quantum information and computing. Through a comprehensive examination of the measurement problem in a two-level quantum system, this paper provides insights into the nature of quantum mechanics and how it differs from classical mechanics, and offers potential solutions for reconciling the two.
3211	Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3 film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite oxide hetero-interfaces.
D2-50	The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly destroying Earth as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun.
3224	This research paper explores the challenges and potential solutions for finding fast paths in large-scale dynamic road networks. With the exponential growth of urban populations and increasing demand for efficient transportation, it has become critical to develop algorithms that can quickly calculate the fastest routes in dynamic road networks. The paper analyzes existing methods for fast pathfinding and proposes a novel approach that utilizes a combination of heuristics, machine learning, and real-time data processing. The proposed method is tested on real-world datasets and compared with existing approaches, demonstrating superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of more efficient transportation systems and could lead to improvements in traffic management and congestion reduction.
1150	Using first principles calculations, we study the microscopic origin of ferroelectricity (FE) induced by magnetic order in the orthorhombic HoMnO3. We obtain the largest ferroelectric polarization observed in the whole class of improper magnetic ferroelectrics to date. We find that the two proposed mechanisms for FE in multiferroics, lattice- and electronic-based, are simultaneously active in this compound: a large portion of the ferroelectric polarization arises due to quantum-mechanical effects of electron orbital polarization, in addition to the conventional polar atomic displacements. An interesting mechanism for switching the magnetoelectric domains by an electric field via a 180-degree coherent rotation of Mn spins is also proposed.
1533	The development of somites, the embryonic precursors of the vertebrate body segments, is regulated by a complex network of genetic interactions. This study aims to investigate how the oscillations observed in this network are converted into the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the synchronization of these oscillations is critical for generating the spatial patterns observed in somite formation. We show that the timing and duration of the oscillations are also important factors in determining the final somite pattern. Our results suggest that the genetic network regulating somite formation is highly sensitive to small changes in its parameters, indicating a robust and precise system. These findings provide insight into the mechanistic basis of somite formation and have implications for understanding the development of other complex biological systems.
2696	We investigate the physical property of the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.
3982	We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a length-independent value in the presence of radiation.
1905	This research paper presents a novel approach to designing algebraic distributed space-time codes with low maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. The proposed codes are constructed using algebraic techniques that allow for efficient encoding and decoding, as well as low complexity ML decoding. The codes are designed for distributed antenna systems, where multiple antennas are distributed across different nodes in a network. The proposed codes are shown to achieve high data rates while maintaining low decoding complexity, making them ideal for practical applications. The performance of the proposed codes is evaluated using simulations in various network scenarios, and the results demonstrate that they outperform existing state-of-the-art codes in terms of both performance and complexity. The proposed codes provide a promising solution for high-speed and low-latency communication in distributed antenna systems.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of using VIMOS spectroscopy to better understand the properties of extended emission line regions in galaxies."
1736	A SU(4) flavor symmetrical Lagrangian is constructed for the interaction of the pseudo-scalar mesons with the vector mesons. SU(4) symmetry is broken to SU(3) by suppression of terms in the Lagrangian where the interaction should be driven by charmed mesons. Chiral symmetry can be restored by setting this new SU(4) symmetry breaking parameters to zero. Unitarization in coupled channels leads to the dynamical generation of resonances. Many known axial resonances can be identified including the new controversial X(3872) and the structure found recently by Belle around 3875 MeV in the hidden charm sector. Also new resonances are predicted, some of them with exotic quantum numbers.

The critical outcomes of this research are the identification of the limits of human survival in such extreme conditions and the need for further exploration of innovative techniques to enhance survival time. The conclusion highlights the importance of continued research in this area to expand our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and the potential implications for space exploration and beyond.
529	We derive an approach to define the causal direction of the wavevector of modes in optical metamaterials, which in turn, determines signs of refractive index and impedance as a function of {\it real and imaginary} parts of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. We use the developed technique to demonstrate that the interplay between resonant response of constituents of metamaterials can be used to achieve efficient dispersion management. Finally we demonstrate broadband dispersion-less index and impedance matching in active nanowire-based negative index materials. Our work opens new practical applications of negative index composites for broadband lensing, imaging, and pulse-routing.
514	The research paper investigates the ordering of fluids in narrow capillaries. The authors analyze the helical, angular, and radial ordering of fluids in capillaries of varying diameters and surface properties. They find that the ordering of fluids is influenced by the capillary diameter and the surface properties, with narrower capillaries and hydrophobic surfaces promoting greater ordering. Additionally, they observe that the ordering of fluids in capillaries can be manipulated by changing the flow rate and the surface properties. The authors conclude that their findings have implications for the design of microfluidic devices and porous materials for applications such as filtration and separation.

The notable conclusion of the study is that the proposed unified approach to energy-efficient power control can be a promising solution for large CDMA systems that require both high performance and energy efficiency."
2780	The exact formula for the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with constant density, which was discovered by Kimura, Takamura and Yokomakura, has been applied mostly to the standard case with three flavor neutrino so far. In this paper applications of their formula to more general cases are discussed. It is shown that this formalism can be generalized to various cases where the matter potential have off-diagonal components, and the two non-trivial examples are given: the case with magnetic moments and a magnetic field and the case with non-standard interactions. It is pointed out that their formalism can be applied also to the case in the long baseline limit with matter whose density varies adiabatically as in the case of solar neutrino.
349	This research paper explores the phenomenon of large scale intermittency in the atmospheric boundary layer. The main theme of the paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric turbulence and its impacts on atmospheric transport and mixing. The study uses observational data and numerical simulations to examine the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations. The noteworthy results of the research suggest that large scale intermittency is a universal feature of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, and that it has significant implications for the transport and dispersion of air pollutants. The paper concludes that a better understanding of large scale intermittency is crucial for improving air quality models and predicting the dispersion of air pollutants in urban environments.
D2-77	The possibility of extraterrestrial life is rooted in the abundance of potentially habitable environments and the presence of basic components necessary for life. In our solar system, planets like Mars and moons such as Europa and Enceladus show promise due to evidence of water, a key ingredient for life. Beyond our solar system, exoplanets in habitable zones, identified through missions like Kepler, suggest countless opportunities for life. However, while conditions may be favorable, the origin of life remains elusive, requiring the right environment, building blocks, and catalytic events. Detection of life relies heavily on advanced telescopes and space probes, with confirmation posing significant challenges. Regardless of current limitations, the search for extraterrestrial life continues.

The results of their analysis show that the overhead and packet length increase with the number of packets and decrease with the size of the field. Moreover, the new algorithm they propose reduces the overhead significantly. The paper provides insights into the design of practical random linear coding systems and shows that random linear coding can achieve high efficiency and reliability over the erasure channel.
2137	Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades. Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially. Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.
3946	A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.
3372	This research paper explores the phenomenon of limit cycles in the presence of convection and utilizes a travelling wave analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms. Limit cycles are oscillations that occur in dynamical systems and have important applications in various fields, including physics and biology. Convection, which arises due to temperature differences, can significantly affect the behavior of limit cycles. The paper proposes a mathematical model to describe the interplay between limit cycles and convection and investigates the resulting dynamics. The travelling wave analysis provides insight into the spatiotemporal behavior of the system and reveals important features such as bifurcations and stability. The results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of limit cycles in complex systems and have implications for the design of control strategies in practical applications.
3342	This research paper investigates the entanglement dynamics of a system consisting of two atoms and two photon modes in a Jaynes-Cummings model. We analyze the time evolution of the entanglement of the atoms and photons using the concurrence and entropy measures. Different initial states of the system are considered, and the entanglement behavior is studied under various system parameters such as coupling strength and detuning. Our results show that the entanglement dynamics are highly dependent on the initial state and system parameters. We also observe that the entanglement between the atoms and photons can be sustained for longer periods of time under certain conditions. These findings have implications for quantum information processing and quantum communication using two-qubit and two-mode systems.

D2-86	Robotic education is nothing but the Hybrid Education that is provided to students, education when integrated with technology and coding is called as Robotic education. Robotic education is far better than the traditional educational system because of it instructional based teaching. Coding is not preparing an application, it is just understanding the instructions in a sequence and then execution them in a way we need the result. Coding allows the users to create something, traditional education is all about learning that is there in book, where creativity, critical thinking, programming is neglected. As robotic education is based on algorithm (set of programmed instructions to execute in sequence) it triggers students to go one step ahead.
868	A singular foliation on a complete riemannian manifold M is said to be riemannian if each geodesic that is perpendicular at one point to a leaf remains perpendicular to every leaf it meets. We prove that the regular leaves are equifocal, i.e., the end point map of a normal foliated vector field has constant rank. This implies that we can reconstruct the singular foliation by taking all parallel submanifolds of a regular leaf with trivial holonomy. In addition, the end point map of a normal foliated vector field on a leaf with trivial holonomy is a covering map. These results generalize previous results of the authors on singular riemannian foliations with sections.
2372	Kontsevitch's work on Airy matrix integrals has led to explicit results for the intersection numbers of the moduli space of curves. In a subsequent work Okounkov rederived these results from the edge behavior of a Gaussian matrix integral. In our work we consider the correlation functions of vertices in a Gaussian random matrix theory, with an external matrix source, in a scaling limit in which the powers of the matrices and their sizes go to infinity simultaneously in a specified scale. We show that the replica method applied to characteristic polynomials of the random matrices, together with a duality exchanging N and the number of points, allows one to recover Kontsevich's results on the intersection numbers, through a simple saddle-point analysis.
4042	Globular clusters (GCs) are spherical groups of stars that orbit around the galactic center. The horizontal branch (HB) is a region in the HR diagram where stars are burning helium in their cores. In this study, we investigate the kinematic properties of GCs with extended HBs, using data from the Gaia mission. We discover that these GCs exhibit a kinematic decoupling, with their cores moving differently from their outer regions. We propose that this decoupling is due to the presence of multiple stellar populations with different ages and metallicities. Our results suggest that the formation and evolution of GCs are more complex than previously thought, and that the extended HB is a useful tracer of their kinematic properties.
1091	"We discuss in this article a property of action of groups by isometries called ""well displacing"". An action is said to be well displacing, if the displacement function is equivalent to the the displacement function for the action on the Cayley graph. We relate this property with the fact that orbit maps are quasi-isometric embeddings. We first describe countrexamples that shows this two notions are unrelated in general. On the other hand we explain that for a certain class of groups -- in particular hyperbolic groups -- these two properties are equivalent. In the course of our discussion, we introduce an intrinsic property of the group -- that we called the U-property -- which says quantitatively how the norm an element is controlled by the translation length of finitely many related conjugacy classes. This property play a central role in our discussion."
1900	We investigate the dimerization and fusion of C60 molecules to form various C60 dimers when pushed against each other at several inter-molecular distances. We study the stability of this dimerized C60 molecule based on its binding strength provided by intramolecular interactions. Tersoff potential, which is considered to represent intramolecular interactions well, has been used to calculate potential energy at these distances of separation and for all possible orientations of the molecules. We observe that several minimum energy configurations exist at various distances between the C60 molecules. Our calculation shows that apart from the dumbbell structures, many interesting composite phases also result, such as fused, peanut and carbon nanotubes of geometry (5,5) and (10,0) of certain specific length.
1859	We study Markov processes associated with stochastic differential equations, whose non-linearities are gradients of convex functionals. We prove a general result of existence of such Markov processes and a priori estimates on the transition probabilities. The main result is the following stability property: if the associated invariant measures converge weakly, then the Markov processes converge in law. The proofs are based on the interpretation of a Fokker-Planck equation as the steepest descent flow of the relative Entropy functional in the space of probability measures, endowed with the Wasserstein distance. Applications include stochastic partial differential equations and convergence of equilibrium fluctuations for a class of random interfaces.
1554	This research paper explores the relationship between modules over operads and functors, focusing on the structure of these objects and their interactions. Operads are algebraic structures that capture the notion of composition in various mathematical contexts, while functors are transformations between categories that preserve structure. This paper examines how modules over operads and functors relate to one another, including the construction of free modules and the algebraic properties of these objects. The paper also explores applications of these concepts in areas such as algebraic topology and homological algebra. Overall, this research aims to deepen our understanding of the connections between operads, functors, and their associated modules, shedding light on the fundamental algebraic structures underlying many branches of mathematics.
2156	In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.
123	We study a novel configuration for displacement detection consisting of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to both, a radio frequency superconducting interference device (RF SQUID) and to a superconducting stripline resonator. We employ an adiabatic approximation and rotating wave approximation and calculate the displacement sensitivity. We study the performance of such a displacement detector when the stripline resonator is driven into a region of nonlinear oscillations. In this region the system exhibits noise squeezing in the output signal when homodyne detection is employed for readout. We show that displacement sensitivity of the device in this region may exceed the upper bound imposed upon the sensitivity when operating in the linear region. On the other hand, we find that the high displacement sensitivity is accompanied by a slowing down of the response of the system, resulting in a limited bandwidth.
2613	This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.
2968	Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic junctions.
1656	"Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual lenses to characterize what is important in mathematics. Originally the main lenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our focus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory is laid by first showing that the object-to-object ""heteromorphisms"" between the objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to group map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic theory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the heteromorphisms between the objects of different categories."
1322	The paper explores the coevolution of quantum wave functions and the Friedmann universe, using numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of a scalar field in a cosmological setting. The results show that the evolution of the wave function is strongly influenced by the expansion of the universe, leading to the suppression of high-frequency modes and the emergence of classical behavior. This phenomenon is found to be related to the growth of the scale factor and the onset of inflation. The study suggests that the interplay between quantum mechanics and cosmology may have important implications for our understanding of the early universe and the nature of physical reality. Overall, the research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop a consistent and comprehensive theory of quantum gravity.

By analyzing the electrical properties of individual nanoscale emitters, the authors demonstrate the presence of Coulomb blockade, a quantum mechanical effect that restricts the flow of electrons through small conductors. The study also identifies the key factors that influence Coulomb blockade, such as emitter size and temperature, and proposes a theoretical model to explain these observations. This research sheds new light on the fundamental physics of electron emission from nanoscale conductors and has important implications for the design of future electronic devices.

Overall, the paper highlights the importance of prime graphs in understanding the complex combinatorial structures that arise in mathematical objects."

Using a numerical simulation approach, the authors examine the effects of magnetic fields and spin polarization on the transport characteristics of the system. They find that spin-polarized transport can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field and bias voltage, and that the spin polarization can be enhanced by increasing the coupling between the quantum dots. The authors conclude that these findings could have important implications for the development of spintronic devices, which rely on the manipulation of electron spin for information storage and processing.

722	The Exact Renormalisation Group (ERG) flow has been employed as a powerful tool in many-body physics to study the behavior of ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit. This research paper aims to investigate the ERG flow for ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit and analyze the critical behavior of the system. The study will employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the ERG flow and its implications for ultracold Fermi gases. The results of this investigation will contribute significantly to the current understanding of the physical properties of ultracold Fermi gases in the unitary limit and provide insights into the critical behavior of these systems.
1374	The long-ranged elastic model, which is believed to describe the evolution of a self-affine rough crack-front, is analyzed to linear and non-linear orders. It is shown that the nonlinear terms, while important in changing the front dynamics, are not changing the scaling exponent which characterizes the roughness of the front. The scaling exponent thus predicted by the model is much smaller than the one observed experimentally. The inevitable conclusion is that the gap between the results of experiments and the model that is supposed to describe them is too large, and some new physics has to be invoked for another model.
1207	This research paper explores the detection of 658 GHz vibrationally-excited water masers using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The study aims to understand the physical properties and dynamics of the maser emission in the context of star-forming regions and active galactic nuclei. The observations were carried out using the SMA, a state-of-the-art radio interferometer located in Hawaii, and the analysis was performed using advanced data reduction and modeling techniques. The results demonstrate the high sensitivity and resolution of the SMA in detecting and characterizing the maser emission, providing valuable insights into the processes that drive the formation and evolution of galaxies and stars. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for future observational studies of maser emission and their role in astrophysical processes.
2464	A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and inflation.
488	This research paper presents the direct measurement of the radius and density of the transiting exoplanet HD 189733B using the CHARA Array. The main focus of the study is to accurately determine the physical properties of the exoplanet, which can provide valuable insights into its composition and formation. The crucial findings of the research indicate that the exoplanet has a radius of 1.138   0.046 times that of Jupiter and a density of 0.75   0.16 g/cm . These results suggest that the exoplanet has a predominantly gaseous composition with a small rocky core. The study highlights the importance of direct measurements in understanding the properties of transiting exoplanets and provides a new method for future exoplanet research.
3037	It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however, suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the importance of relay selection.
2992	We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
3866	We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.
1673	This research paper investigates the density profile of local elliptical galaxies as potentially being violently relaxed, collisionless, dissipationless systems. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we analyze the surface brightness profiles of a sample of elliptical galaxies and compare them to theoretical predictions for density profiles of collisionless, dissipationless systems. We find that the observed density profiles are consistent with these predictions, suggesting that local ellipticals may indeed be violently relaxed systems. This has implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies, as well as for the broader field of galaxy formation and evolution.
2507	This research paper investigates the deviation of the vacuum refractive index induced by a static gravitational field. The study uses the framework of general relativity to derive the equation for the refractive index deviation and investigates its behavior in different conditions.

The study also highlights the potential applications of the refractive index deviation in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. The conclusions of the research suggest that the refractive index deviation can be used as a tool for observing and analyzing the properties of gravitational fields and their effects on light propagation.
3149	This research paper presents the results of a simultaneous monitoring campaign of the blazar PKS0537-441 in 2005 using the Swift and REM telescopes. Blazars are a type of active galactic nuclei that exhibit extreme variability in their emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The simultaneous monitoring campaign was conducted to investigate the correlation between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar PKS0537-441. The paper presents the light curves and spectral energy distributions obtained from the joint observations and analyzes the variability patterns in both energy bands. The results show a complex interplay between the X-ray and optical emission properties of the blazar, indicating the need for simultaneous monitoring campaigns to fully understand the physics of blazar emission.
11	This research paper explores the application of lens space surgeries on A'Campo's divide knots. These knots are known for their intricate structure and topological properties, and lens space surgeries provide a powerful tool for investigating their behavior. We begin by reviewing the basic theory of A'Campo's divide knots and their associated invariants. We then introduce the concept of lens space surgeries and discuss their potential applications to these knots. We provide a detailed analysis of the effects of lens space surgeries on A'Campo's divide knots, including the changes in their invariants and the resulting topological structures. Our results show that lens space surgeries can significantly alter the properties of these knots, leading to new insights into their behavior and potential applications in various fields of mathematics and physics.
773	We report on far infrared measurements of interplane conductivity for underdoped single-crystal YBa2Cu3Oy in magnetic field and situate these new data within earlier work on two other high-Tc cuprate superconductors, La(2-x)SrxCuO4 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d). The three systems have displayed apparently disparate electrodynamic responses in the Josephson vortex state formed when magnetic field H is applied parallel to the CuO2 planes. Specifically, there is discrepancy in the number and field dependence of longitudinal modes observed. We compare and contrast these findings with several models of the electrodynamics in the vortex state and suggest that most differences can be reconciled through considerations of the Josephson vortex lattice ground state as well as the c-axis and in-plane quasiparticle dissipations.
365	"The research paper titled ""Particle-based modeling of oxygen discharges"" presents a computational model for simulating the behavior of oxygen discharges. The authors use a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method to simulate the interactions between charged particles and neutral molecules in an oxygen plasma. The results show that the model accurately predicts the electrical and chemical properties of the plasma, as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma species.

D2-67	The Lavoisier Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, was formulated by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. This law states that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products during a chemical reaction. In simpler terms, matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it only transforms from one form to another. This fundamental principle revolutionized chemistry, as it emphasized the importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding the fate of matter in reactions. The law laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory and remains a cornerstone of scientific understanding.
3786	This research paper focuses on the equation of state for dense hydrogen and the plasma phase transition.

Additionally, the equation of state for dense hydrogen shows agreement with experimental data and provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen in extreme environments. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the properties of matter at high pressures and temperatures.

The article concludes that CMDNC is a promising protocol for improving the efficiency and reliability of cooperative transmission systems.
2397	This research paper focuses on the lower bounds for the communication capacities of two-qudit unitary operations. The communication capacity of a quantum channel determines the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through the channel. In this work, we investigate the lower bounds for the communication capacity of two-qudit unitary operations, which are essential building blocks in quantum communication and computing. We provide a rigorous analysis of the lower bounds using a combination of information-theoretic and algebraic techniques. Our results shed new light on the fundamental limits of quantum communication and may have practical implications for the design of quantum communication protocols.
2755	We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.
D1-30	The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains uncertain, with two main theories under discussion. The dominant hypothesis suggests a natural origin through zoonotic spillover, where the virus jumped from bats, its likely reservoir, to humans, possibly via an intermediate species such as pangolins. This theory links the early outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live wild animals were sold. Another theory suggests an accidental leak from a laboratory, like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat coronaviruses, though no direct evidence supports this claim. While most scientists favor the natural origin hypothesis, limited data and restricted early access make the exact source of the virus difficult to confirm.
2626	"The research paper titled ""Comment on 'Mass and Width of the Lowest Resonance in QCD'"" presents a critical analysis of a recent study on the properties of the lowest resonance in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The primary theme of the paper is to examine the methodology used in the original study and to provide alternative calculations to support or refute the findings. The authors conclude that while the original study provides interesting insights into the behavior of the resonance, there are limitations to the methodology used that need to be addressed.

380	"The research paper titled ""Tuning the conductance of a molecular switch"" investigates the conductance of a molecular switch, which is a key component of nanoelectronics. The researchers used a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental techniques to study the conductance of a specific molecular switch known as the D-A system. They found that the conductance of the D-A system can be tuned by changing the distance between the donor and acceptor groups within the molecule. Additionally, they found that the conductance of the D-A system is strongly influenced by the configuration of the molecule. Overall, the results of this study provide important insights into the design and optimization of molecular switches for use in future nanoelectronics."
3358	This research paper focuses on the high-mass star formation process and the dynamical evolution of Orion Source I on 10-100 AU scales using SiO masers. The researchers utilized the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to obtain high-resolution images of the SiO masers and analyzed the data to understand the physical properties of the masers and their location relative to the central protostar. The results of the study reveal that the SiO masers trace the outflowing gas and the rotation of the circumstellar disk around the protostar. The findings provide critical insights into the early stages of high-mass star formation and the role of SiO masers in probing the dynamical evolution of protostellar systems.
2772	"The research paper ""The Limits of Special Relativity"" examines the limitations of the theory of special relativity in the context of high-energy physics. The paper discusses the shortcomings of special relativity in explaining phenomena such as the behavior of particles at high energies and the existence of dark matter. The paper proposes that a more comprehensive theory that accounts for these limitations is needed. The findings indicate that while special relativity is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of particles at low energies, it has limitations in the high-energy regime. Therefore, a more comprehensive theory is needed to explain the behavior of particles at all energy levels."
922	This research paper investigates the application of quantum mechanics to Hilbert manifolds and explores the principle of functional relativity. The main objective is to develop a mathematical framework for describing quantum systems on infinite-dimensional manifolds and to demonstrate that the principle of functional relativity holds in this context. Key results include the derivation of a Schr dinger-like equation on a Hilbert manifold and the demonstration that the principle of functional relativity holds for both classical and quantum systems. The paper concludes that the principle of functional relativity is a fundamental property of physical systems and should be considered in the development of future quantum theories.
1932	The complementary strands of DNA molecules can be separated when stretched apart by a force; the unzipping signal is correlated to the base content of the sequence but is affected by thermal and instrumental noise. We consider here the ideal case where opening events are known to a very good time resolution (very large bandwidth), and study how the sequence can be reconstructed from the unzipping data. Our approach relies on the use of statistical Bayesian inference and of Viterbi decoding algorithm. Performances are studied numerically on Monte Carlo generated data, and analytically. We show how multiple unzippings of the same molecule may be exploited to improve the quality of the prediction, and calculate analytically the number of required unzippings as a function of the bandwidth, the sequence content, the elasticity parameters of the unzipped strands.
3072	This research paper assesses the availability of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems based on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles, using a case study approach. The study analyzed the logfiles of a production server over a period of six months and identified various types of system failures. The analysis revealed that the majority of the system failures were caused by hardware issues and software bugs. The study also discussed the limitations of relying solely on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles for availability assessment and suggested the use of additional monitoring tools for a more comprehensive approach. The findings of this study can be useful for system administrators and IT professionals in identifying potential system failures and improving the overall availability of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems.

The authors introduce a new mathematical framework, the Generalized sqrt(epsilon)-law, which allows for a more accurate description of this phenomenon. Through numerical simulations, they demonstrate the importance of including these unphysical source terms in NLTE radiative transfer codes and suggest that this can serve as an additional test of the accuracy of these codes. The main outcome of this research is the development of a more comprehensive understanding of resonance line polarization transfer, which has implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.

281	The paper describes a tracking control algorithm for multi-agent systems with an active leader and variable topology. The goal is to achieve consensus among the agents by tracking the trajectory of the leader. The proposed algorithm uses a decentralized control law that takes into account the relative positions and velocities of neighboring agents. The authors prove that the algorithm guarantees asymptotic convergence to the leader trajectory under certain assumptions on the communication topology and control parameters. They also provide simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in achieving consensus. The paper highlights the importance of the leader role in multi-agent systems and presents a practical approach to achieving consensus in a decentralized manner.
3106	Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets.

The entire FUSE data set has recently been reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and the format of the resulting calibrated data files.
788	This paper examines the efficiency gains that can be achieved in generalized method of moments (GMM) models when auxiliary data is available. We consider a semiparametric approach that allows for nonparametric estimation of the moment functions, and we show that incorporating auxiliary data in the estimation procedure can lead to substantial efficiency improvements. We develop a semiparametric efficiency bound that characterizes the best possible efficiency that can be achieved with the available information, and we propose a computationally efficient estimator that asymptotically achieves this bound. We illustrate our approach through a simulation study and an empirical application to the estimation of a production function using data from the U.S. manufacturing sector. Our results suggest that incorporating auxiliary data can lead to significant efficiency gains, particularly when the sample size is small or the instrument set is weak.

2671	This research paper explores the preparation and detection of magnetic quantum phases in optical superlattices. The authors investigate the behavior of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice that is generated by interfering laser beams. Using a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, they demonstrate the emergence of a magnetic quantum phase with long-range order in the lattice. This phase is characterized by the appearance of a spin density wave, which can be detected using a variety of techniques. The authors conclude that optical superlattices offer a promising platform for studying magnetic quantum phases and could have potential applications in quantum information processing and sensing.

The theory is based on the notion of placeholder substructures, which provides a flexible framework for constructing and manipulating zero-divisor spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several examples of infinite-dimensional zero-divisor spaces, including those arising in algebraic geometry and functional analysis. Our results show that the bit-string-driven recipe theory provides a powerful tool for studying the properties of these spaces and offers insights into their underlying structures. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing research in the field of zero-divisor spaces and offers new avenues for future investigations.
485	We conduct a review of experimental results on Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR's) including measurements of the features of the spectrum, the composition of the primary particle flux and the search for anisotropy in event arrival direction. We find that while there is a general consensus on the features in the spectrum -- the Second Knee, the Ankle, and (to a lesser extent) the GZK Cutoff -- there is little consensus on the composition of the primaries that accompany these features. This lack of consensus on the composition makes interpretation of the agreed upon features problematic. There is also little direct evidence about potential sources of UHECRs, as early reports of arrival direction anisotropies have not been confirmed in independent measurements.
D2-98	Plasticizers like phthalates were thought to be mainly hormone disruptors. They caused fertility problems and adverse developmental effects. Surprisingly, since the 2000s researchers noted that they were instrumental in causing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another key point, phthalates can be absorbed through the skin, ingested by mouth or inhaled. In order to understand how phthalates cause cardiovascular disease, we need to investigate the effects of phthalates on fatty tissue. Phthalates have a negative effect on fatty tissue that leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Fat cells develop out of adipose stem cells committing themselves and maturing into fatty cells that can store lipids. This process has the name adipogenesis.
2965	This research paper investigates the flavor composition and energy spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos, which are high-energy particles that originate from outside our solar system. Using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the authors analyze the arrival times and energies of neutrino events and determine the proportion of different neutrino flavors (electron, muon, and tau). They find that the flavor composition is consistent with theoretical predictions and that the energy spectrum follows a power law distribution. Additionally, the authors discuss the implications of these results for understanding the sources and mechanisms of astrophysical neutrinos. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the properties of these elusive particles and their role in astrophysical processes.

It involves advanced genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR for gene editing and synthetic DNA construction, alongside computational modeling and bioprinting. Applications span medicine, environmental science, and industry, including the development of organisms capable of producing medications, biofuels, or addressing environmental challenges. While it holds great potential, synthetic biology also raises ethical considerations regarding the unintended consequences of engineered organisms and the responsible use of this technology to ensure societal benefits.

The paper introduces a method for constructing such joinings and establishes several key properties of this class, including its relationship to other known classes of joinings. Notably, the paper proves that under certain conditions, this new class of joinings is equivalent to the class of independent joinings, which has important implications for studying probabilistic systems. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of pairwise-independent joinings and their role in probability theory.
913	The paper proposes a reconstruction algorithm for models on random graphs, which is able to recover the model parameters with high accuracy. The algorithm is based on a local-to-global approach, where local observations are used to estimate the global parameters. The authors also prove that the algorithm is optimal in terms of sample complexity and provides a tight bound on the number of samples required for accurate reconstruction. The proposed algorithm is then applied to various models on random graphs, including the stochastic block model, the exponential random graph model, and the degree-corrected block model. The results show that the algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and sample complexity. Overall, the paper provides a practical and efficient method for reconstructing models on random graphs, which has important applications in network analysis and social sciences.
888	Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations, these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth, five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps.
2947	This research paper investigates the thermal effects in solid state lasers, specifically focusing on ytterbium-doped materials. The primary objective of this study is to understand how thermal effects impact the performance of solid state lasers and to identify potential solutions to mitigate these effects. Through a series of experiments and simulations, the study reveals that thermal effects can significantly impair the performance of ytterbium-doped solid state lasers, leading to reduced efficiency and output power. To address this issue, the study proposes using advanced cooling techniques and optimizing the laser cavity design. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the thermal effects in solid state lasers and suggest practical solutions to improve their performance.
310	"The paper titled ""Combination of OFDM and CDMA for high data rate UWB"" discusses the use of a combination of two wireless communication techniques, namely, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), for achieving high data rates in Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems. The paper proposes a novel UWB communication system that uses OFDM as the base modulation scheme and CDMA for spreading the data across different channels. The authors explain the benefits of using this combination, such as high spectral efficiency, improved data security, and low power consumption. They also present simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving high data rates. Overall, the paper concludes that the combination of OFDM and CDMA is a promising technique for achieving high data rates in UWB communication systems."
1375	"The recent developments of the phase string theory for doped antiferromagnets will be briefly reviewed. Such theory is built upon a singular phase string effect induced by the motion of holes in a doped antiferromagnet, which as a precise property of the t-J model dictates the novel competition between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. A global phase diagram including the antiferromagnetic, superconducting, lower and upper pseudogap, and high-temperature ""normal"" phases, as well as a series of anomalous physical properties of these phases will be presented as the self-consistent and systematic consequences of the phase string theory."
1249	We provide a general classification of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories that can be obtained from orbifolding of theories with four and eight supercharges. We impose at least one preserved supercharge on the lattice and Lorentz invariance in the naive continuum limit. Starting with four supercharges, we obtain one two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, identical to the one already given in the literature. Starting with eight supercharges, we obtain a unique three-dimensional lattice gauge theory and infinitely many two-dimensional lattice theories. They can be classified according to seven distinct groups, five of which have two preserved supercharges while the others have only one.
385	This research paper investigates the transport properties of disordered graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) through a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. The study focuses on the impact of different types of disorder on the electronic transport behavior of GNRs, including edge disorder and vacancy defects. Our findings reveal that edge disorder can significantly reduce the transport gap in GNRs and enhance the conductance of the system, while vacancy defects lead to localized states that impede the transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that the transport properties of GNRs are strongly influenced by the width of the ribbon and the degree of disorder. The results of our study provide important insights into the design and optimization of graphene-based devices for electronic and optoelectronic applications.
2989	This research paper aims to quantify the evolution of social groups. The study is based on analyzing data from various social networks and online communities. The research uses network analysis and statistical modeling to identify the factors that contribute to the growth and decline of social groups over time. The critical outcomes of the research indicate that the size of a group, the frequency of interactions, and the diversity of members play a crucial role in the evolution of social groups. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering these factors when designing social networks and online communities. The conclusions of the research suggest that by understanding the evolution of social groups, we can create more effective social networks and communities that foster engagement and growth.
146	The research paper discusses the coordination of a group of autonomous mobile agents with multiple leaders. The study proposes a decentralized approach that enables agents to coordinate their movements without relying on a central control system. The approach uses a combination of local communication and decision-making algorithms to achieve coordination. The paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving coordination and maintaining the formation of the group of agents. The findings indicate that the decentralized approach can efficiently coordinate a group of autonomous agents with multiple leaders, even when the environment is dynamic and uncertain. The study concludes that the proposed approach is a promising solution for coordination problems in multi-agent systems.
D2-68	The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms to produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost-effective manner. Current examples include producing beer, wine, cheese, pharmaceuticals, and other biotechnology products.[2] Another possible area of use is the development of oil crops whose composition has been modified to improve their nutritional value.[3] Some of the common strategies used for metabolic engineering are (1) overexpressing the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, (2) blocking the competing metabolic pathways, (3) heterologous gene expression, and (4) enzyme engineering. Since cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have drastic effects on the cells' viability.
2590	We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory. For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.
1269	"The research paper titled ""On the formation of gyration-like excitations in solid solutions"" investigates the origin and properties of gyration-like excitations in solid solutions. The study focuses on exploring the relationship between the crystal structure and the formation of these excitations. The research findings reveal that gyration-like excitations arise due to the interplay between the atomic vibrations and the crystal symmetry. Furthermore, the study concludes that these excitations could play a crucial role in the dynamics and transport properties of solid solutions. Overall, the research provides critical insights into the fundamental physics of solid solutions and opens new avenues for technological applications."
2896	I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.
1034	We consider a model for periodic patterns of charges constrained over a cylindrical surface. In particular we focus on patterns of chiral helices, achiral rings or vertical lamellae, with the constraint of global electroneutrality. We study the dependence of the patterns' size and pitch angle on the radius of the cylinder and salt concentration. We obtain a phase diagram by using numerical and analytic techniques. For pure Coulomb interactions, we find a ring phase for small radii and a chiral helical phase for large radii. At a critical salt concentration, the characteristic domain size diverges, resulting in macroscopic phase segregation of the components and restoring chiral symmetry. We discuss possible consequences and generalizations of our model.
975	This research paper examines the flow of autonomous traffic on a single multi-lane street. The study utilizes a microscopic traffic simulation model to investigate the impact of autonomous vehicles on traffic flow, including speed, capacity, and density. Results demonstrate that the introduction of autonomous vehicles can improve traffic flow by increasing capacity and reducing delays. The study also highlights the importance of lane management strategies and the need for infrastructure upgrades to support autonomous vehicle operations. These findings have important implications for the development and implementation of autonomous traffic systems in urban environments, including potential benefits for reducing congestion and improving safety.
3905	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes. The primary focus is to understand and identify the process that leads to moment switching in these probes and evaluate the impact of such occurrences on their overall performance. The study utilizes experimental techniques to analyze the behavior of the probes and identify the factors that influence moment switching. The critical outcomes of this research highlight the importance of moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes and provide insights into the design and optimization of the probes for various applications. The paper concludes that moment switching is a critical factor that must be considered in the design and operation of nanotube magnetic force probes, and provides recommendations for future research in this area.
1790	The aim of this article is to study a nonlinear system modeling a Non-Newtonian fluid of polymer aqueous solutions. We are interested here in the existence of weak solutions for the stationary problem in a bounded plane domain or in two-dimensional exterior domain. Due to the third order of derivatives in the non-linear term, it's difficult to obtain solution satisfying energy inequality. But with a good choice of boundary conditions, an adapt special basis and the use of the good properties of the trilinear form associated to the non-linear term, we obtain energy solutions. The problem in bounded domain is treated and the more difficult problem on non bounded domain too.
2815	The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems. Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and (x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs, K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...
3645	A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
511	In this paper we present large-scale correlated calculations of linear optical absorption spectrum of oligo-acenes containing up to seven benzene rings. For the calculations we used the Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) Hamiltonian, along with the configuration interaction (CI) technique at various levels such as the full CI (FCI), the quadruple CI (QCI) and multi-reference singles-doubles CI (MRSDCI). The role of Coulomb parameters used in the P-P-P Hamiltonian was examined by considering standard Ohno parameters, as well as a screened set of parameters. A detailed analysis of the many-body character of the important excited states contributing to the linear absorption has also been performed. The results of our calculations have been compared extensively with the theoretical work of other authors, as well as with the experiments.
1628	We show that condensation in a capped capillary slit is a continuous interfacial critical phenomenon, related intimately to several other surface phase transitions. In three dimensions (3d), the adsorption and desorption branches correspond to the unbinding of the meniscus from the cap and opening, respectively and are equivalent to 2d-like complete-wetting transitions. For dispersion forces, the singularities on the two branches are distinct, owing to the different interplay of geometry and intermolecular forces. In 2d we establish precise connection, or covariance, with 2d critical-wetting and wedge-filling transitions, i.e. we establish that certain interfacial properties in very different geometries are identical. Our predictions of universal scaling and covariance in finite capillaries are supported by extensive Ising model simulation studies in 2d and 3d.
2743	Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (SHB?PT) is a theoretical framework that describes the interactions of heavy baryons with pions. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effective field theory of SHB?PT, which includes different orders of perturbative corrections. We show that SHB?PT can accurately reproduce the experimental data for various observables, such as the mass of the ?b baryon and the decay rates of the ?b and ?b baryons. Our results demonstrate the power and versatility of SHB?PT as a tool for studying the strong interactions of heavy baryons with light mesons.
2502	We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015+161 each has an infrared excess that can be understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid with a chondritic composition.
581	The paper presents a quantum theory of orbital magnetization and its generalization to interacting systems. The theory is based on the use of the Berry phase and the adiabatic approximation, which allows for a description of the magnetic properties of quantum systems. The authors show that the theory provides a better understanding of the magnetization of materials and can be used to predict the properties of materials with potential applications in electronics and spintronics. The results suggest that the theory can be used to explain complex phenomena observed in condensed matter systems and that it has potential for use in the development of new materials.
3960	"In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the exclusion principle ""Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential surface simultaneously"" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic energies."
3675	This research paper presents a novel approach for the intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources. The proposed method is based on a combination of time difference of arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques, which enables the estimation of the location of multiple sources in real time. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations and experiments, which show that it can accurately locate multiple sources with high precision and low error. The results suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to enhance the performance of acoustic emission monitoring systems in various applications, such as structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. Part II of this research paper will further extend the proposed method to handle more complex scenarios, such as sources with different amplitudes and frequencies, and to investigate its robustness under different noise conditions.
835	This research paper investigates the structure of sunspot penumbrae, with a specific focus on the origin of dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains. The study utilizes the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium model to analyze penumbral flux tubes. The results suggest that the dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains originate from the convective overshoot region and the MHS equilibrium in penumbral flux tubes. The findings shed light on the fundamental physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of sunspot penumbrae. This research has significant implications for our understanding of the dynamics of sunspots and their impact on space weather.
2948	Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.
873	"The research paper titled ""Quantum Hacking: Experimental demonstration of time-shift attack against practical quantum key distribution systems"" explores the vulnerability of quantum key distribution systems to time-shift attacks. The paper presents experimental results that show how an attacker can exploit timing errors to gain unauthorized access to quantum keys. The study reveals that practical quantum key distribution systems are susceptible to time-shift attacks, and the security of these systems must be improved to prevent such attacks. The paper concludes that quantum cryptography protocols must be designed with robust timing mechanisms to prevent time-shift attacks and ensure the security of quantum keys."
287	We give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed equivariant total Chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed bundles by a linear group action. This fine moduli scheme is described explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions. We use this description to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy Murphy's Law, in the sense of Vakil. The preliminary sections of the paper give a self-contained introduction to Klyachko's classification of toric vector bundles.
1659	Deformation Theory is a natural generalization of Lie Theory, from Lie groups and their linearization, Lie algebras, to differential graded Lie algebras and their higher order deformations, quantum groups. The article focuses on two basic constructions of deformation theory: the universal solution of Maurer-Cartan Equation (MCE), which plays the role of the exponential of Lie Theory, and its inverse, the Kuranishi functor, as the logarithm. The deformation functor is the gauge reduction of MCE, corresponding to a Hodge decomposition associated to the strong deformation retract data. The above comparison with Lie Theory leads to a better understanding of Deformation Theory and its applications, e.g. the relation between quantization and Connes-Kreimer renormalization, quantum doubles and Birkhoff decomposition.
4027	We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases accessible from it.
1066	"The research paper titled ""Radiative Properties of a Linear Chain of Coupled Qubits"" explores the behavior of a collection of coupled qubits when subjected to external radiation. The paper focuses on the radiative properties of the qubits, including their emission and absorption rates, as well as the coherence of the emitted radiation. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of a linear chain of identical qubits, with the results indicating that the radiative properties of the chain are strongly dependent on the coupling strength between the qubits. The paper concludes that the coherence of the emitted radiation can be significantly enhanced by controlling the coupling strength between the qubits, which could have important implications for the development of future quantum technologies."
1832	"The research paper ""Trapping and Cooling a Mirror to its Quantum Mechanical Ground State"" discusses the experimental achievement of cooling a macroscopic mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state. The researchers used a cavity optomechanical system to trap and cool a mirror in a high-finesse optical cavity, allowing them to observe the quantum behavior of the mirror's motion. The experiment demonstrated the ability to prepare a macroscopic object in its lowest energy state, which has potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement. The paper concludes that this achievement opens up new possibilities for exploring the boundary between classical and quantum physics in macroscopic systems."
3857	This research paper presents a study on modeling the three-point correlation function (TPCF) of galaxies in the universe. The TPCF is a statistical measure that describes the clustering of galaxies in three dimensions. We explore different approaches for modeling the TPCF, including analytical models and numerical simulations. We compare these models to observational data from large galaxy surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results show that the TPCF is sensitive to various cosmological parameters, such as the matter density and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. We also investigate the impact of galaxy bias, which is the tendency of galaxies to cluster differently than the underlying matter distribution. Our findings suggest that accurate modeling of the TPCF is crucial for understanding the large-scale structure of the universe and testing cosmological theories.
2169	This research paper aims to explore the possibility of learning more from the Lorentz transformations, which have been a cornerstone of special relativity for over a century. The paper examines the history of the transformations and their role in modern physics, as well as current research in the field. Through an analysis of various approaches to studying the Lorentz transformations, the paper argues that there is still much to be learned from this fundamental concept. The research also proposes new avenues for investigating the transformations, including the use of computational methods and experimental measurements. Ultimately, this paper provides insights into the potential for uncovering new knowledge and understanding in the field of special relativity through a deeper exploration of the Lorentz transformations.
3888	This research paper presents a parametrized post-Newtonian expansion of Chern-Simons gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity that includes a term proportional to the product of the curvature tensor and the Chern-Simons form. Using this expansion, the authors derive the equations of motion for a test particle in the presence of a spherically symmetric source. They then compare these equations to the predictions of general relativity and find that the two theories differ significantly for certain values of the parameters. This suggests that observations of gravitational waves could be used to constrain the parameters of Chern-Simons gravity and test its validity as an alternative theory of gravity.
923	Hypermultiplet couplings in type IIA string theory on a Calabi-Yau space can be quantum corrected by D2-brane instantons wrapping special Lagrangian cycles. On the other hand, hypermultiplet couplings in the heterotic string on a K3 surface are corrected by world-sheet instantons wrapping curves. In a class of examples, we relate these two sets of instanton corrections. We first present an analogue of the c-map for the heterotic string via a dual flux compactification of M-theory. Using this duality, we propose two ways of capturing quantum corrections to hypermultiplets. We then use the orientifold limit of certain F-theory compactifications to relate curves in K3 to special Lagrangians in dual type IIA compactifications. We conclude with some results from perturbative string theory for hypermultiplet F-terms and a conjecture about the topology of brane instantons.
1220	"The research paper ""Plastic-damage model for concrete in principal directions"" presents a new model for predicting the behavior of concrete material under different loading conditions. The model is based on a plastic-damage framework and takes into account the anisotropic nature of the material. The study focuses on the principal directions of concrete, which are the directions of maximum and minimum material strength. The model is validated through experimental data and numerical simulations, which show good agreement with the predicted behavior. The results indicate that the proposed model can accurately predict the damage evolution and failure behavior of concrete in principal directions. The study concludes that the plastic-damage model can be a useful tool for predicting the behavior of concrete structures under different loading conditions and can aid in the design of more resilient and durable structures."
3636	The paper presents a novel approach for designing parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) using Kinetostatic Performance Criteria (KPC) as the basis for design optimization. The KPC approach considers the dynamic performance of the machine tool, such as its stiffness, accuracy, and workspace, in addition to its kinematic performance. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the KPC approach through a case study involving the design of a 5-axis PKMT. The results show that the KPC approach can significantly improve the performance of PKMTs compared to traditional design approaches. The paper concludes that the KPC approach can provide a valuable tool for the design and optimization of PKMTs in various applications.

2497	This research paper explores the concept of electroweak Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance. It presents the theoretical framework and mathematical models that explain the relationship between electroweak symmetry breaking and scale invariance. The paper also discusses the implications of this concept in the context of particle physics and the Standard Model. The main outcome of this research is the identification of the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, which plays a crucial role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The conclusion drawn from this study is that the Higgs boson is essential in providing mass to fundamental particles and that its discovery is a significant milestone in the field of particle physics.
244	"The research paper titled ""Correlators and fractional statistics in the quantum Hall bulk"" investigates the fractional statistics of particles in the quantum Hall effect. The authors use the Chern-Simons theory to model the behavior of these particles and calculate the correlators, or the statistical relationships between different particles. They find that these correlators exhibit fractional statistics, meaning that the particles behave as if they have a fractionally charged or fractional spin. The paper's crucial conclusion is that this fractional behavior arises from the topological properties of the system, rather than the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the exotic behavior of particles in the quantum Hall effect and sheds light on the fundamental properties of matter."
2441	This research paper explores the behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in one dimension at a nonzero chemical potential. We investigate the phase structure of this system and analyze the effects of temperature and chemical potential on the system's properties. Our results show that the system exhibits a rich phase structure, including a chiral condensate phase and a superfluid phase. Moreover, we found that the phase structure is strongly influenced by the chemical potential, which has the potential to significantly impact the fundamental understanding of QCD. Our study has important implications for the study of QCD and sheds light on the possible behavior of this system in extreme conditions.

The authors review the various modal extraction techniques used in these systems, including the finite element method and the Fourier transform method. They then propose a new approach based on the wavelet transform method, which is shown to be more accurate and efficient. The paper concludes that the wavelet transform method is a promising technique for modal analysis in spatially extended systems, and it can be used to improve the accuracy of structural models for various applications."
3896	This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex. The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
1248	This research paper presents an ab initio density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic structure of barium titanate (BaTiO3). The study investigates the electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and electronic charge density distribution of BaTiO3. The results show that BaTiO3 has a direct band gap of 3.41 eV, and the electronic charge density is mainly distributed between the Ti and O atoms. The study also confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3, which can significantly affect its electronic properties. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of BaTiO3 and its potential applications in electronic devices.
3492	We present a new interatomic potential for water captured in a charge-transfer embedded atom method (EAM) framework. The potential accounts for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms as a function of the local chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of water.
D1-24	Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on the planet, supporting millions of marine species and providing essential services like coastal protection and livelihoods for humans. However, their health is rapidly declining due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for energy, often leading to mass die-offs. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons, further threatening reef stability. The future of coral reefs depends on urgent conservation efforts. Strategies like reducing carbon emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and coral restoration projects (e.g., coral farming) offer hope. Research into resilient coral species and reef rehabilitation techniques is also promising.
2691	This research paper investigates the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight within the framework of the rotationally-invariant slave-boson formalism. The slave-boson formalism is a powerful tool for describing strongly correlated electron systems, and a rotationally-invariant version has been developed to accurately capture the effects of anisotropy in the electron system. We apply this formalism to investigate the quasiparticle weight, which characterizes the strength of the interactions between electrons and their surrounding environment. Our results show that the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight is strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the system, and we provide a detailed analysis of this effect. This research has important implications for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems, and may provide insights into the design of new materials with desirable electronic properties.
D2-63	The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance.

3660	We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.

These heights were introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise."

3449	Two-photon decay rates in simple atoms such as hydrogenlike systems represent rather interesting fundamental problems in atomic physics. The sum of the energies of the two emitted photons has to fulfill an energy conservation condition, the decay takes place via intermediate virtual states, and the total decay rate is obtained after an integration over the energy of one of the emitted photons. Here, we investigate cases with a virtual state having an energy intermediate between the initial and the final state of the decay process, and we show that due to non-uniform convergence, only a careful treatment of the singularities infinitesimally displaced from the photon integration contour leads to consistent and convergent results.

1986	This research paper investigates the use of the average transverse momentum ($p_t$) as a probe of high energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dynamics. By analyzing experimental data from high energy proton-proton collisions, we demonstrate that the average $p_t$ is sensitive to the underlying QCD processes that govern the production of particles in these collisions. Specifically, we find that the behavior of the average $p_t$ is consistent with the predictions of perturbative QCD at high $p_t$, while at lower $p_t$ it deviates from this behavior, indicating the presence of non-perturbative effects. Our results provide a valuable tool for probing the fundamental nature of QCD at high energies and offer new insights into the behavior of particle production in high energy collisions.

2096	Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show variability.

In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to study the performance at the device scale.

3332	The work reported below is a first of its kind study of the properties of turbulent flow without strong mean shear in a Newtonian fluid in proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, with emphasis on the small scale aspects. The main tools used are a three-dimensional particle tracking system (3D-PTV) allowing to measure and follow in a Lagrangian manner the field of velocity derivatives and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The comparison of flow properties in the turbulent (A), intermediate (B) and non-turbulent (C) regions in the proximity of the interface allows for direct observation of the key physical processes underlying the entrainment phenomenon. The differences between small scale strain and enstrophy are striking and point to the definite scenario of turbulent entrainment via the viscous forces originating in strain.
3608	In this talk I have raised the question of how the future discovery of leptonic CP violation can be made robust even at accepting the rather large current experimental uncertainties in our knowledges of neutrino propagation in matter. To make progress toward answering the difficult question, I listed ways to proceed: (1) Obtain tighter constraints on the MSW theory by testing it by various neutrino experiments. (2) Measure the matter effect in situ, namely within the experiment for discovering CP violation itself. (3) Uncover leptonic CP violation in a matter effect free environment. I also reported a step made toward the above point (2) by taking neutrino factory as a concrete setting; An accurate in situ measurement of the matter effect looks promising.

We use numerical simulations to study the behavior of a condensate as it undergoes rapid expansion and observe the formation of a sonic horizon, a boundary beyond which sound waves cannot propagate. Our results indicate that the formation of a sonic horizon is dependent on the initial velocity and the strength of the interactions between the particles in the condensate. We also observe the emergence of shock waves and the formation of vortices in the condensate. Our findings have implications for the study of superfluids and the behavior of quantum fluids in extreme conditions. Overall, this research highlights the complex and fascinating behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates and the importance of further exploration in this field.
D2-79	Greenland is as old as the rest of the earth. And it has no other name than Grønland or Grœnland both of which translate and even sound close to Greenland. The very first humans there were Vikings or Norse, which as government evolved became Denmark. Norway and Denmark, Iceland and Faroe Islands, even areas of England and Scotland ruled by Vikings came under a united Denmark. The story is Ingólgur Arnason wanted to discourage more people coming so named his discovery Iceland, but Eric the Red wanting to encourage settlers named his discovery Greenland although Greenland is more appropriate for Iceland and Iceland more appropriate for Greenland. Just consider them early examples of 5th Avenue Advertizing.
966	We report on measurements of an elementary surface mode in an ultracold, strongly interacting Fermi gas of 6Li atoms. The radial quadrupole mode allows us to probe hydrodynamic behavior in the BEC-BCS crossover without being influenced by changes in the equation of state. We examine frequency and damping of this mode, along with its expansion dynamics. In the unitarity limit and on the BEC side of the resonance, the observed frequencies agree with standard hydrodynamic theory. However, on the BCS side of the crossover, a striking down shift of the oscillation frequency is observed in the hydrodynamic regime as a precursor to an abrupt transition to collisionless behavior; this indicates coupling of the oscillation to fermionic pairs.
3725	From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.

Additionally, they find that users tend to focus their attention on a small number of topics, leading to a polarization of attention. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of novelty and attention in online communities.
1865	Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for a micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit.

We show that this onchip cooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response time of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible experimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be cooled down by several orders of magnitude.

874	"A detailed analysis of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in spacelike Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory is presented. A semiclassical treatment reproduces the leading terms of the tree-level result from quantum field theory. Moreover, certain quantum corrections turn out to be suppressed for large energies of the charged particle, for example, the quantum corrections to the classical MCS Cherenkov angle. It is argued that MCS-theory Cherenkov radiation may, in principle, lead to anisotropy effects for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In addition, a qualitative discussion of vacuum Cherenkov radiation from a modified-Maxwell term in the action is given, together with UHECR bounds on some of its dimensionless ""coupling constants."""

1714	"Fourier phases contain a vast amount of information about structure in direct space, that most statistical tools never tap into. We address ALMA's ability to detect and recover this information, using the probability distribution function (PDF) of phase increments, and the related concepts of phase entropy and phase structure quantity. We show that ALMA, with its high dynamical range, is definitely needed to achieve significant detection of phase structure, and that it will do so even in the presence of a fair amount of atmospheric phase noise. We also show that ALMA should be able to recover the actual ""amount"" of phase structure in the noise-free case, if multiple configurations are used."
231	In the purely affine formulation of gravity, the gravitational field is represented by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor of the affine connection. The classical electromagnetic field can be represented in this formulation by the second Ricci tensor of the connection. Such a construction is dynamically equivalent to the sourceless Einstein-Maxwell equations. We generalize this construction to the case with sources, represented by the derivative of the affine Lagrangian density with respect to the connection. We show that the Maxwell equations with sources emerge for the simplest affine Lagrangian for matter, while the Einstein and Lorentz equations arise if mass has electromagnetic origin. We also show that the Maxwell equations replace the unphysical constraint imposed by the projective invariance of purely affine Lagrangians that depend explicitly on the connection.
1951	This research paper presents an inverse Monte-Carlo approach to determine effective lattice models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. The method involves generating a large number of gauge configurations using Monte-Carlo simulations, and then fitting them to an effective lattice model using a Bayesian analysis framework. The effective model parameters are optimized to reproduce the thermodynamic observables of the Yang-Mills theory, such as the energy density and pressure. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the inverse Monte-Carlo approach in determining accurate effective models for SU(3) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. This research has important implications for the development of effective models for non-perturbative studies of quantum chromodynamics.
3630	The research paper discusses the outburst of the X-ray transient H 1743-322 in 2003 and compares it to the black hole microquasar XTE J1550-564. The authors analyze the X-ray and radio properties of both objects during their outbursts and find that H 1743-322 had a longer duration and lower peak luminosity than XTE J1550-564. They also suggest that the differences in the outburst properties may be due to the different accretion rates and magnetic field strengths of the black holes. Overall, the paper provides insight into the behavior of black holes during outbursts and highlights the importance of studying multiple objects to understand the underlying physics.
D2-12	Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and immune function, primarily by regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Humans can synthesize vitamin D through skin exposure to sunlight (UVB rays), but factors like limited sun exposure, darker skin, age, and geographic location can reduce production. The recommended daily intake varies by age and health status. For most adults, 600-800 IU (15-20 µg) per day is sufficient, though some individuals may require higher doses, especially if deficient. Dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and weakened immunity, making adequate vitamin D intake crucial for overall health and well-being. Regular checks can ensure optimal levels.

According to the observational result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.
3658	We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement

D2-93	Metabolic engineering is not another form of classic manipulation of intermediary metabolism; rather, it is the purposeful design of metabolic networks. The metabolic engineering approach examines biochemical reactions in their entirety, rather than individually, and is concerned with the construction of novel pathways, the thermodynamic feasibility of pathways, and the location of limiting branch-point(s) and enzymatic reaction(s) in a reaction network. The ultimate goal is the construction of strains with superior yield and productivity obtained through a convergent evolutionary process. Progress has been made toward this objective within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis through the development of methodologies for the experimental determination of elasticities and flux control coefficients.

Overall, this study provides important insights into the chemical properties of star-forming dwarf galaxies and highlights the need for further research in this area.

Using a one-dimensional model, the interactions between the charged particles and the magnetic field were taken into account. The results showed that the dusty plasma slab supported the formation of magnetosonic solitons, which propagate with a constant amplitude and velocity. The amplitude and width of the solitons were found to depend on the dust density and magnetic field strength. The study also revealed that the presence of dust particles in the plasma significantly altered the soliton's behavior, causing it to exhibit a new mode of oscillation. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of dusty plasmas and could be useful in developing new technologies for plasma-based devices.

D2-37	Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a close relationship. The likelihood and severity of type 2 diabetes are closely related to BMI. Obese people have a higher risk of diabetes than healthy weight people, with a threefold increase in risk for overweight people. While it is well known that body fat distribution is an important primary indicator of diabetes risk, the precise mechanism of association is unknown. It is also unknown why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and why not all type 2 diabetics are obese. Also obesity significantly increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in your life. When there is an excess of fat, the tissues must process more nutrients.
662	This research paper presents a new Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model for simulating nuclear collisions at the microscopic level. The model incorporates the effects of Coulomb interactions, surface tension, and mean-field potentials to accurately predict the behavior of nuclear matter during collisions. The simulation results show that this new QMD model is capable of reproducing experimental data with high precision. Notably, the study reveals that the Coulomb repulsion between the colliding nuclei plays a critical role in the reaction dynamics. The results obtained from this study have important implications for the understanding of nuclear reactions and the design of future experiments in nuclear physics.
424	This research paper proposes an automated evaluation metric for Chinese text entry that evaluates the performance of input methods based on their ability to predict the next character in an input sequence. The metric uses a corpus of Chinese text to generate a benchmark of expected performance and compares the accuracy of input methods against this benchmark. The evaluation metric was tested on a dataset of over 800,000 input sequences and found to be effective in identifying the most accurate input methods. The results suggest that this automated evaluation metric can be a useful tool for improving the performance of Chinese text entry systems.

The authors investigate the behavior of quintessence in various cosmological models and analyze its impact on the evolution of the universe. They find that quintessence can have a significant effect on the cosmic history and can potentially provide an explanation for the observed acceleration. The study also highlights the importance of considering both the dynamics and the properties of quintessence in order to better understand its role in the universe. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its impact on the evolution of the cosmos.
1063	The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321. This class contains the freely-braided permutations and the fully-commutative permutations. In this work, we show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative pattern classes can be transformed to give generating functions for the corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes. Moreover, this transformation of generating functions is rational. As a result, we obtain enumerative formulas for the pattern classes mentioned above as well as the corresponding hexagon-avoiding pattern classes where the hexagon-avoiding permutations are characterized by avoiding 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, and 56781234.
1475	"The research paper titled ""On the Universal Tachyon and Geometrical Tachyon"" explores the properties of tachyons in the context of string theory. The paper investigates the universal tachyon, which is present in all string theories, and the geometrical tachyon, which arises from the dynamics of branes in curved spacetime. The authors use a variety of mathematical techniques to study the behavior of these tachyons, including conformal field theory and homotopy theory. The paper presents several key findings, including the existence of a universal tachyon potential and the emergence of a geometrical tachyon in certain brane configurations. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of tachyons and their role in string theory."
3765	An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.
4019	Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
3472	The refractive index of a dielectric medium comprising both passive and inverted components in its permittivity was determined using two methods: (i) in the time domain, a finite-difference algorithm to compute the frequency-domain reflectance from reflection data for a pulsed plane wave that is normally incident on a dielectric half-space, and (ii) in the frequency domain, the deflection of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam on transmission through a dielectric slab. The dielectric medium was found to be an active medium with a negative real part for its refractive index. Thereby, a recent controversy in the scientific literature was resolved.
2030	This research paper focuses on measuring the energy dependent polarization in soft gamma-rays using Compton scattering in PoGOLite. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the polarization properties of soft gamma-rays and their dependence on energy. The paper discusses the experimental setup and data analysis techniques used to measure the polarization in the energy range of 25-80 keV. The results show that the polarization fraction increases with energy, and the polarization angle is consistent with the expected value for Compton scattering. The study concludes that PoGOLite is a promising instrument for measuring polarization in soft gamma-rays.
3743	We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.
274	We use continuum theory to show that chirality is a key thermodynamic control parameter for the aggregation of biopolymers: chirality produces a stable disperse phase of hexagonal bundles under moderately poor solvent conditions, as has been observed in {\it in-vitro} studies of F-actin [O. Pelletier {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 148102 (2003)]. The large characteristic radius of these chiral bundles is not determined by a mysterious long-range molecular interaction but by in-plane shear elastic stresses generated by the interplay between a chiral torque and an unusual, but universal, non-linear gauge term in the strain tensor of ordered chains that is imposed by rotational invariance.
200	This research paper explores the thermodynamics of squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes, focusing on the concepts of mass and free energy. Through a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these black holes, the paper reveals important insights into the behavior of these objects and their relationship to the wider field of thermodynamics. The primary findings of the research suggest that the mass and free energy of squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes are tightly linked, with changes in one variable leading to corresponding changes in the other. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of black holes and the broader field of physics. Overall, the research provides a valuable contribution to the field of black hole thermodynamics and sheds new light on the complex nature of these enigmatic objects.
419	We review Maxwell's multipole vectors, and elucidate some of their mathematical properties, with emphasis on the application of this tool to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, for a completely random function on the sphere (corresponding to the statistically isotropic Gaussian model of the CMB), we derive the full probability density function of the multipole vectors. This function is used to analyze the internal configurations of the third-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe quadrupole and octopole, and we show the observations are consistent with the Gaussian prediction. A particular aspect is the planarity of the octopole, which we find not to be anomalous.
646	This research paper explores the development of a surface-gated InSb quantum well single electron transistor (SET) for use in low-temperature electronic applications. The primary theme of the study is the use of a surface gate to control the electron transport through the transistor. The researchers found that the surface gate was successful in controlling the electron transport, and they were able to demonstrate single-electron charging effects in the device. The paper also presents an analysis of the device's performance and concludes that the surface-gated SET has the potential to be a promising platform for future electronic applications.
2856	This research paper focuses on the Genetic Programming Collaboration Network (GPCN) and its communities. The GPCN is a network of researchers who collaborate to advance the field of genetic programming through the exchange of ideas, research, and resources. The paper explores the structure of the GPCN, including its various communities, and highlights the key findings from an analysis of the network's collaboration patterns. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the future of genetic programming research and collaboration. The outcomes of this research suggest that the GPCN is a valuable resource for researchers in the field and that collaboration within the network is essential for advancing the field of genetic programming.
2100	Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.
3967	This paper investigates the evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole and explores the effect of the black hole quadrupole on this evolution. The Carter constant plays a crucial role in determining the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes and is particularly important for understanding the dynamics of objects approaching black holes. We use numerical simulations to study the evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole with and without a quadrupole moment. Our results show that the quadrupole moment has a significant impact on the evolution of the Carter constant, causing it to vary more rapidly and exhibit greater complexity. These findings have important implications for understanding the gravitational waves emitted by inspirals into black holes and for testing the predictions of general relativity in strong gravitational fields.
204	This research paper investigates the resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom in multidimensional chaotic map dynamics, with the aim of establishing them as a basis for further analysis. The study employs a combination of numerical simulations and analytical techniques to identify and isolate the resonant modes of the system. Through this analysis, the authors demonstrate that these modes can be effectively controlled and manipulated through external forcing, leading to potentially significant applications in fields such as cryptography and secure communications. Ultimately, the findings of this research provide a valuable contribution to the ongoing study of chaotic systems and their potential for practical use.
1926	The idea that substantial absorption in AGN could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of QSO evolution was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of X-ray absorbed AGN at z~1 to z~3, that have shown strong emission at 850 mkm. This strong emission is a signature of the copious star formation. In AGN evolution model, the main obscured growth phase of the QSO coincides with formation of the host galaxy spheroid, the completion of which indicates the beginning of the luminous, unobscured phase of the QSO's evolution. The verification of this model at redshifts up to z~6 appears possible via application of the gamma-ray resonant absorption method.
2602	This research paper investigates the obscured X-ray source population in the HELLAS2XMM survey by analyzing data from the Spitzer telescope. The researchers find that a significant portion of the X-ray sources are obscured by dust and gas, and that the majority of these sources are likely to be active galactic nuclei. Additionally, they find that the Spitzer data allows for a more precise determination of the properties of these obscured sources, providing valuable insights into the evolution of galaxies and black holes. Overall, this study highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations for a comprehensive understanding of the X-ray source population.
D2-92	With the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) from research laboratories into routine clinical use, it is important to redefine the most appropriate use of each imaging technique. The aim of this review article is to show the potential of PET in oncology. We discuss the most promising indications and the perspectives for the future. We will also point out the shortcomings and the important questions to be answered before fully considering PET as a necessary tool in the day-to-day practice of oncology. Although many studies have documented the high accuracy of 18F-FDG PET for the detection and staging of malignant tumours and for the monitoring of therapy results in these patients.
D2-54	Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations the behavior of quark and gluon propagators is studied in the Landau gauge for momenta from the deep Euclidean to the confinement regime. We find that while at short distances quarks and gluons propagate like free particles, over longer distances, of the order of a fermi, the gluon propagator is greatly enhanced as are the triple-gluon and quark-gluon couplings. These in turn suppress the propagation of massless quarks over long distances to such an extent that they have no physical particle pole, exactly as expected of a confining theory. We study the way the world changes as the number of massless flavors of quark is increased from zero.
1245	We study the relation between PageRank and other parameters of information networks such as in-degree, out-degree, and the fraction of dangling nodes. We model this relation through a stochastic equation inspired by the original definition of PageRank. Further, we use the theory of regular variation to prove that PageRank and in-degree follow power laws with the same exponent. The difference between these two power laws is in a multiple coefficient, which depends mainly on the fraction of dangling nodes, average in-degree, the power law exponent, and damping factor. The out-degree distribution has a minor effect, which we explicitly quantify. Our theoretical predictions show a good agreement with experimental data on three different samples of the Web.
492	This research paper investigates the quantum effects in black holes using the Schwarzschild black string as a model. The study focuses on analyzing the behavior of the quantum fields near the black string horizon and examining the relationship between the black string and traditional Schwarzschild black holes. The results reveal that the quantum fields near the horizon exhibit distinct effects, such as the Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the quantum nature of black holes in understanding their behavior. The findings of this research contribute to the ongoing study of black holes and their role in the universe.
1772	We use optical tweezers to perform stretching experiments on DNA molecules when interacting with the drugs daunomycin and ethidium bromide, which intercalate the DNA molecule. These experiments are performed in the low-force regime from zero up to 2 pN. Our results show that the persistence length of the DNA-drug complexes increases strongly as the drug concentration increases up to some critical value. Above this critical value, the persistence length decreases abruptly and remains practically constant for larger drug concentrations. The contour length of the molecules increases monotonically and saturates as drugs concentration increases. Measured in- tercalants critical concentrations for the persistence length transition coincide with reported values for the helix-coil transition of DNA-drug complexes, obtained from sedimentation experiments.
2606	"The research paper titled ""The Reverse Shock of SNR 1987A"" focuses on the study of the reverse shock wave generated by the supernova explosion of SNR 1987A. The paper outlines the observations and analysis of the X-ray and radio emissions from the supernova remnant over a period of 30 years since its explosion. The study provides important insights into the physical properties of the reverse shock wave and its interaction with the surrounding medium. The research concludes that the reverse shock wave has a significant impact on the evolution of supernova remnants and the distribution of cosmic ray particles in the interstellar medium."
1412	This research paper investigates the relationship between the asymmetry of the Hamiltonian and the Tolman's length, which is a measure of the thermodynamic properties of curved surfaces. The study explores the impact of asymmetry on the Tolman's length in various systems, including black holes, condensed matter systems, and cosmological models. The findings suggest that the asymmetry of the Hamiltonian significantly affects the Tolman's length, leading to non-trivial consequences for the thermodynamic behavior of curved surfaces. The results have implications for the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena and may have practical applications in the design of advanced materials.
D2-82	A PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that allows doctors to observe the metabolic activity of tissues and organs in the body. It involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer (a substance containing a radioactive atom) into the bloodstream. This tracer is typically a form of glucose that is metabolized by cells. The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the tracer, creating detailed images that show how tissues are functioning, rather than just their structure. PET scans are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders (such as Alzheimer’s disease). They are especially useful in identifying abnormal cell activity, which can help detect cancerous tumors.
500	We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.
572	A trapping mechanism is observed and proposed as the origin of the anomalous behavior recently discovered in transport properties of overdamped ratchets subject to external oscillatory drive in the presence of quenched noise. In particular, this mechanism is shown to appear whenever the quenched disorder strength is greater than a threshold value. The minimum disorder strength required for the existence of traps is determined by studying the trap structure in a disorder configuration space. An approximation to the trapping probability density function in a disordered region of finite length included in an otherwise perfect ratchet lattice is obtained. The mean velocity of the particles and the diffusion coefficient are found to have a non-monotonic dependence on the quenched noise strength due to the presence of the traps.
182	The aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a laser in a plasma. At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To solve this huge linear system, one uses a iterative Krylov method with a preconditioning by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightments on the parallel implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture.
D2-73	"Lamarck's ""Hydrogéologie"" (1802) represents a fascinating but often overlooked contribution to early geological thought. While Lamarck is primarily remembered for his evolutionary biology theories, this work showcases his broader scientific vision. In it, he proposed that Earth's features formed through gradual processes over immense time periods—challenging the catastrophist views popular in his era. The text emphasized water's crucial role in shaping landscapes and theorized about atmospheric influences on geological formations. Notably, Lamarck's uniformitarian approach in geology paralleled his biological thinking about gradual change. Though overshadowed by his biological works and contemporaries like Cuvier, ""Hydrogéologie"" demonstrates Lamarck's cross-disciplinary thinking and his willingness to challenge scientific orthodoxy across multiple fields."
248	This research paper investigates the existence and properties of symmetric and asymmetric solitons in linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in optical lattices. The theoretical analysis is based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the numerical simulations are performed using the split-step Fourier method. We demonstrate that symmetric solitons can exist in BECs with equal coupling strengths, while asymmetric solitons can appear in BECs with unequal coupling strengths. The stability of the solitons is also analyzed and it is found that the symmetric solitons are more stable than the asymmetric ones. Additionally, the influence of the lattice depth on the soliton properties is investigated. Our findings can be used to design and control soliton dynamics in BEC systems, which have potential applications in quantum information processing and precision measurements.
72	"The research paper titled ""An Analysis of the Shapes of Interstellar Extinction Curves. V. The IR-Through-UV Curve Morphology"" focuses on analyzing the shapes of interstellar extinction curves. The primary theme of this research is to study the morphology of IR-through-UV extinction curves and investigate their variations in different environments. The research findings suggest that the shape of the extinction curve depends on the physical properties of the interstellar environment, such as the size distribution of dust grains and the abundance of heavy elements. The conclusions drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the nature and evolution of interstellar dust and the interstellar medium."
967	This research paper focuses on the dynamics of a strongly interacting Fermi gas and examines the radial quadrupole mode of the gas. The authors use a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to study the behavior of the gas under different conditions. The findings suggest that the radial quadrupole mode can be used as a sensitive probe of the properties of the gas, including its temperature and interaction strength. The paper concludes that the radial quadrupole mode is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting Fermi gases and could have important applications in areas such as quantum computing and condensed matter physics.
3941	"The research paper titled ""The Arctic Circle Revisited"" focuses on the changes occurring in the Arctic region due to climate change. The paper discusses the melting of glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, as well as the impact of these changes on the Arctic ecosystem and the people living in the region. The authors conclude that urgent action is needed to address the effects of climate change in the Arctic, as the consequences will be felt not only in the Arctic region but also globally. The paper also highlights the need for more research to better understand the complex and interconnected systems in the Arctic and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing the vulnerability of the Arctic and taking immediate action to address the impacts of climate change."
2012	Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the number of matches is known or not in advance.
3864	"While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass."
2858	This research paper proposes an effective conservation of energy and momentum algorithm using switching potentials for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamical systems. The algorithm is designed to address the challenges of accurately simulating complex systems with large numbers of particles while maintaining energy and momentum conservation. The switching potentials method allows for the accurate calculation of forces between particles, ensuring that energy and momentum are conserved throughout the simulation. The proposed algorithm is tested on various thermodynamical systems and is found to be effective in maintaining energy and momentum conservation while accurately simulating the behavior of the systems. This algorithm has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers in the field of molecular dynamics simulation.
700	This research paper explores the concept of intrinsically universal one-dimensional quantum cellular automata (QCAs) in two distinct flavours. We investigate the properties and characteristics of these QCAs and their potential applications in quantum computation and information processing. Our study is based on comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, which reveal the intrinsic universality and robustness of these QCAs. We also discuss the potential challenges and limitations in implementing these QCAs in experimental settings. Our findings highlight the significance of intrinsically universal QCAs in advancing the field of quantum computing and offer new insights into the design and optimization of quantum circuits and algorithms.
1545	This research paper explores the possibility of using D-branes as a means of constructing a bubbling Calabi-Yau manifold. Calabi-Yau manifolds are fundamental objects in string theory, and have been extensively studied due to their importance in understanding the extra dimensions predicted by the theory. This paper presents a new approach to constructing Calabi-Yau manifolds by studying the behavior of D-branes in the presence of fluxes. The paper demonstrates that D-branes can indeed be used to construct a bubbling Calabi-Yau manifold, and discusses the implications of this result for further research in string theory. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe.
1550	We observe several interesting phenomena in a technicolor-like model of electroweak symmetry breaking based on the D4-D8-D8bar system of Sakai and Sugimoto. The benefit of holographic models based on D-brane configurations is that both sides of the holographic duality are well understood. We find that the lightest technicolor resonances contribute negatively to the Peskin-Takeuchi S-parameter, but heavy resonances do not decouple and lead generically to large, positive values of S, consistent with standard estimates in QCD-like theories. We study how the S parameter and the masses and decay constants of the vector and axial-vector techni-resonances vary over a one-parameter family of D8-brane configurations. We discuss possibilities for the consistent truncation of the theory to the first few resonances and suggest some generic predictions of stringy holographic technicolor models.
2984	We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
1062	The study of quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers is an area of active research due to its potential for detecting gravitational waves. In this paper, we investigate the existence of second and higher-order quasi-normal modes in binary black hole mergers using numerical simulations. Our results show that these modes do indeed exist, and that they can provide valuable information about the properties of the black holes involved in the merger. In particular, we find that the frequencies of these modes are sensitive to the spin of the black holes, providing a new avenue for studying these important astrophysical objects. These findings have important implications for the future detection and analysis of gravitational waves, as well as for our understanding of the dynamics of black hole mergers.
321	"We propose a new algorithm to the problem of polygonal curve approximation based on a multiresolution approach. This algorithm is suboptimal but still maintains some optimality between successive levels of resolution using dynamic programming. We show theoretically and experimentally that this algorithm has a linear complexity in time and space. We experimentally compare the outcomes of our algorithm to the optimal ""full search"" dynamic programming solution and finally to classical merge and split approaches. The experimental evaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either show a lower time complexity or provide polygonal approximations closer to the input discrete curves."
D2-27	In 1802, Lamarck published Hydrogéologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe. That year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life.
2983	This research paper aims to investigate and compare the effects of driven activation and thermal activation on the performance of a particular system. The study uses experimental methods to explore the differences in activation mechanisms and their impact on the system's output. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the experimental results, including the characterization of the activation mechanisms and the identification of the key factors that influence system performance. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of driven activation and thermal activation, and the implications of these mechanisms for the design and optimization of systems. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research in this area.
2848	This research paper investigates the oriented growth of pentacene films on vacuum-deposited polytetrafluoroethylene layers that are aligned using the rubbing technique. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the alignment on the morphology and electrical properties of the pentacene films. The results indicate that the rubbing technique produces highly aligned polytetrafluoroethylene layers, which leads to the formation of highly oriented pentacene films. The electrical conductivity of the pentacene films is found to be strongly dependent on the orientation of the film and the direction of the current flow. The study concludes that the rubbing technique can be used to control the orientation and electrical properties of pentacene films, which is important for the development of organic electronic devices.
3093	This research paper investigates the non-extensive thermodynamics of 1D systems with long-range interaction. The main objective is to explore the behavior of such systems under non-extensive statistical mechanics, which has been shown to be more appropriate for systems with long-range interactions. The paper presents a theoretical framework for calculating the thermodynamic quantities of these systems, including the entropy and energy. The results indicate that the non-extensive formalism leads to a better description of the thermodynamic behavior of 1D systems with long-range interaction. Additionally, the study reveals that the parameter q, which characterizes the non-extensive statistical mechanics, plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system. Overall, the findings suggest that non-extensive thermodynamics is a promising approach for understanding the properties of complex systems with long-range interactions.
D2-9	There are two types of diabetes: type 1, where your body is unable to make insulin; and type 2, where your body is unable to properly use the insulin it makes. When your body doesn't have enough insulin, you can't move glucose from your blood to the cells, and then you don't get the nutrients your body needs for energy. Type 2 diabetes is also often genetic, as in my case. The fact that there's no break from the disease. I have diabetes 24/7, 365 days a year. Managing what I eat is a constant challenge, especially when there are potato chips nearby. And honestly, I hate cooking and I'm always looking for easy recipes.
3859	This research paper explores the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, with a focus on the case of weighted projective spaces. Abelian symplectic reductions are a powerful tool in algebraic geometry for studying symplectic quotients. The orbifold cohomology of these reductions is a topological invariant that captures the underlying geometric structure of the quotient space. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions, and derive explicit formulas for the case of weighted projective spaces. Our results shed new light on the interplay between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry, and have potential applications in a wide range of fields, including mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology.
3597	The research paper explores the decoherence of a driven multilevel quantum system that interacts with a multi-bath reservoir. The study aims to investigate the effect of the multi-bath reservoir on the coherence of the quantum system. The research uses a model of a driven three-level system, which is coupled to three independent baths with different spectral densities. The study finds that the coherence of the quantum system is highly sensitive to the spectral density of the baths. The research also shows that the coherence of the system can be enhanced by adjusting the driving frequency and the coupling between the system and the baths. Overall, the study provides insights into the factors that affect the decoherence of a multilevel quantum system and offers potential strategies for mitigating this effect.
2073	"The research paper titled ""Dynamics of single polymers under extreme confinement"" investigates the behavior of polymers in confined environments. Using computer simulations, the study analyzes the dynamics of various polymers under extreme confinement conditions. The findings suggest that confinement significantly affects the movement of polymers, causing them to experience reduced mobility and altered conformational distributions. The study also suggests that the degree of confinement plays a crucial role in determining the polymer's behavior. Overall, the research provides insights into the fundamental dynamics of polymers in confined environments, which can have implications for various applications ranging from drug delivery to materials science."
2654	We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately, sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another ``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.
2916	This research paper explores the collective excitations in a magnetically doped quantized Hall ferromagnet. By utilizing the magneto-optical spectroscopy technique, we investigate the collective modes of the ferromagnet and their dependence on the magnetic field. Our results show that the collective modes can be tuned by varying the magnetic field, which suggests the possibility of controlling the magnetization dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collective modes exhibit a strong coupling with the Landau level transitions, providing insight into the underlying physics of the system. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of the collective excitations in magnetically doped quantized Hall ferromagnets and offer potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.
2119	This research paper explores the dynamics of dislocations in a crystal lattice using the Peierls-Nabarro model. The study focuses on the relief of the lattice and its impact on the movement of dislocations. By analyzing the interactions between dislocations and the lattice relief, the researchers were able to identify key factors that influence the behavior of dislocations. The study also suggests that the Peierls-Nabarro model provides an accurate representation of dislocation dynamics in crystal lattices. Overall, the research contributes to a better understanding of dislocation behavior in materials science and has potential applications in various fields such as engineering and nanotechnology.
3146	We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
D2-100	It is an approximation useful in chemistry, but not strictly correct. It is not, in general, obeyed by nuclear reactions, or even in one common medical procedure, PET scanning (positron emission tomography). In this procedure, radioactive variants of common drug or body chemicals are injected into a patient under observation. Some of a particular radioactive chemical element or elements are radioactive in a particular way—they are neutron-light. Their nuclear reactions in the body are similar to beta-decay of neutron-heavy elements, except that the “electrons” released are not electrons, but the corresponding anti-matter: positrons. As anti-matter, positrons are quite unwelcome in ordinary matter—the patient—and very quickly encounter electrons, annihilating each electron-positron pair.
2099	This research paper investigates the molecular environment of massive star forming cores that are associated with Class II methanol maser emission. The study employs observational data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to analyze the physical and chemical properties of these sources. The results suggest that the methanol maser emission is produced in dense and warm gas environments, and is likely linked to the presence of young and massive stars. The study also identifies several molecular tracers that can be used to probe the physical conditions and chemical evolution of these regions. Overall, the findings shed light on the complex processes involved in the formation of massive stars and their surrounding environments.
1013	This research paper investigates the dynamics of a phantom field in loop quantum cosmology, a theoretical framework that extends loop quantum gravity to the cosmological scale. Using numerical simulations, the study shows that the evolution of the phantom field is significantly affected by the quantum geometry of the universe, which leads to a modification of the classical dynamics. The results suggest that loop quantum cosmology could provide a viable alternative to the standard inflationary paradigm for explaining the early universe's dynamics. The study also highlights the importance of including quantum effects in cosmological models and opens up new avenues for exploring the interplay between quantum gravity and cosmology.
2892	Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities. Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D, to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli exactly equal to seven.
1376	"The research paper titled ""Phase String Theory for Doped Antiferromagnets"" investigates the behavior of doped antiferromagnets using a phase string theory approach. The study explores how the doping of antiferromagnets affects the quantum fluctuations and the ground state properties of the system. The results suggest that the doping-induced quantum fluctuations lead to the emergence of new phases in the system, such as a spin-liquid phase and a superconducting phase. Additionally, the study proposes that the phase string theory approach can be used to explain the anomalous behavior of doped cuprate superconductors. Overall, the research paper highlights the potential of the phase string theory approach for understanding the complex behavior of doped antiferromagnets and provides new insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductivity."
3397	This research paper investigates the effect of a fluctuating cutoff on the inflationary spectra. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the cutoff is subject to stochastic fluctuations that could introduce damped corrections to the spectra. We use the stochastic inflationary model to explore this scenario and derive the corresponding equations that govern the dynamics of the cutoff and the spectra. Our analysis shows that the fluctuations in the cutoff can indeed lead to damped corrections to the spectra, which could have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind these corrections and explore their dependence on the parameters of the model. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the cutoff fluctuations could help improve our ability to extract information about the early universe from observational data.
681	The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument onboard GLAST offers a tremendous opportunity for future blazar studies. In order to fully benefit from its capabilities and to maximize the scientific return from the LAT, it is of great importance to conduct dedicated multi-frequency monitoring campaigns that will result comprehensive observations. Consequently, we initiated an effort to conduct a GLAST-dedicated, quasi-simultaneous, broad-band flux-density (and polarization) monitoring of potential GLAST blazars with the Effelsberg and OVRO radio telescopes (11cm to 7mm wavelength). Here, we present a short overview of these activities which will complement the multi-wavelengths activities of the GLAST/LAT collaboration towards the 'low-energy' radio bands. Further we will give a brief outlook including the extension of this coordinated campaign towards higher frequencies and future scientific aims.
3086	A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. We present first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion path probability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result is then used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heat or entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the path uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.
3126	This research paper investigates the invariants of triangular Lie algebras, a special class of Lie algebras with a triangular decomposition. The main objective of this study is to identify and classify the invariants of such Lie algebras, which are essential for understanding the algebraic structures of various physical systems. We explore the relationship between the Lie algebra structure and its invariants, and prove that for triangular Lie algebras, these invariants are determined by the structure constants of the algebra. We also establish the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial invariants and provide explicit examples of such invariants. Our findings suggest that the invariants of triangular Lie algebras play a crucial role in the study of Lie algebraic structures and their applications in physics and other fields.

Overall, the paper provides insights into the potential benefits of algorithm synthesis and highlights its relevance in modern computing systems.
3529	This research paper aims to investigate the role of elastic stresses in the development of leaf venation patterns. Leaf venation plays a crucial role in plant physiology as it facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the leaf. However, the mechanisms that regulate the formation of venation patterns are not fully understood. In this study, we hypothesize that elastic stresses, resulting from differential growth rates in different regions of the leaf, play a significant role in the development of venation patterns. We will use computational simulations to model the growth and development of leaves under different elastic stress conditions. We will also examine the venation patterns of actual leaves under different experimental conditions. Our results will provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate leaf venation morphogenesis and could contribute to the development of more efficient plant engineering techniques.
D2-26	The global increase in demand for meat and the limited land area available prompt the search for alternative protein sources. Also the sustainability of meat production has been questioned. Edible insects as an alternative protein source for human food and animal feed are interesting in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions, high feed conversion efficiency, low land use, and their ability to transform low value organic side streams into high value protein products. More than 2000 insect species are eaten mainly in tropical regions. The role of edible insects in the livelihoods and nutrition of people in tropical countries is discussed, but this food source is threatened
2589	This research paper explores the concept of Brane-world quantum gravity, which proposes that our universe is a four-dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The paper provides an overview of the theoretical framework and mathematical models used to describe this phenomenon. The study also delves into the implications of Brane-world quantum gravity, including the potential for resolving the hierarchy problem and the prediction of extra dimensions that could be observed in experiments. The research concludes that Brane-world quantum gravity offers a promising avenue for further exploration and understanding of the fundamental nature of our universe.
85	In this article we calculate the electrical conductivity in QED using the 2PI effective action. We use a modified version of the usual 2PI effective action which is defined with respect to self-consistent solutions of the 2-point functions. We show that the green functions obtained from this modified effective action satisfy ward identities and that the conductivity obtained from the kubo relation is gauge invariant. We work to 3-loop order in the modified 2PI effective action and show explicitly that the resulting expression for the conductivity contains the square of the amplitude that corresponds to all binary collision and production processes.
674	This research paper delves into the complexity of model checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HOFL), a formal logic used to express properties of computer programs.

The study's findings have important implications for the development of more efficient tools and techniques for verifying complex software systems. Overall, this research enhances our understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of model checking HOFL and provides a valuable contribution to the field of formal methods for software engineering.

The research also investigates the relationship between domain names and their associated content, including website categories and language. The methodology involves collecting and analyzing a large dataset of domain names and their corresponding attributes. The findings reveal patterns in the statistical behavior of domain systems, providing insights into their underlying structure and potential applications in areas such as cybersecurity and marketing. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the statistical properties of domain systems and their impact on the internet ecosystem.
3876	We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.
3210	This research paper investigates the anisotropic quasiparticle renormalization in Na0.73CoO2 and the role of inter-orbital interactions and magnetic correlations in this process. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observe significant renormalization in the electronic structure of Na0.73CoO2. Our results demonstrate that inter-orbital interactions play a crucial role in the renormalization process, leading to anisotropic renormalization of the quasiparticle bands. We also find evidence for the presence of magnetic correlations, which further enhance the renormalization effect. Our findings provide new insights into the electronic properties of Na0.73CoO2 and have implications for the understanding of other correlated electron systems.
2398	We consider quantum field theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, with the position coordinates represented by twistors instead of the usual world-vectors. Upon imposing canonical commutation relations between twistors and dual twistors, quantum theory of fields described by non-holomorphic functions of twistor variables becomes manifestly non-commutative, with Lorentz symmetry broken by a time-like vector. We discuss the free field propagation and its impact on the short- and long-distance behavior of physical amplitudes in perturbation theory. In the ultraviolet limit, quantum field theories in twistor space are generically less divergent than their commutative counterparts. Furthermore, there is no infrared--ultraviolet mixing problem.
487	We have measured the angular diameter of the transiting extrasolar planet host star HD 189733 using the CHARA O/IR interferometric array. Combining our new angular diameter of 0.377+/-0.024 mas with the Hipparcos parallax leads to a linear radius for the host star of 0.779+/-0.052 Rsol and a radius for the planet of 1.19+/-0.08 RJup. Adopting the mass of the planet as derived by its discoverers, we derive a mean density of the planet of 0.91+/-0.18 g cm-3. This is the first determination of the diameter of an extrasolar planet through purely direct means.
472	This research paper investigates the use of network statistics to analyze early English syntax and identify structural criteria that are unique to this period. Through a quantitative analysis of a large corpus of early English texts, this study uncovers significant patterns and trends in sentence structure that distinguish it from later periods. The results highlight the importance of incorporating network analysis techniques in the study of historical syntax and demonstrate the potential for uncovering new insights into the linguistic evolution of English. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the structural criteria that characterize early English syntax and underscores the value of network statistics in linguistic research.
894	This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally quantized.
3302	"The research paper titled ""Simultaneous recording of two- and four-probe resistive transitions in doped laser-processed Sr-Ru-O"" focuses on studying the electrical properties of doped laser-processed Sr-Ru-O. The primary theme of the research is to understand the resistive transitions in this material by simultaneously recording two- and four-probe measurements. The study reveals that the resistive transitions in doped laser-processed Sr-Ru-O are highly dependent on the dopant concentration and the measurement technique used. The research provides important insights into the electrical properties of this material, which can be useful in the development of new electronic devices."
772	This research paper focuses on the development of reliable memory structures from unreliable components. The key objective of the study is to explore the use of expander graphs as a means of achieving reliable memory structures. The paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of expander graphs in memory design. The authors propose a new design methodology that combines expander graphs with traditional memory design techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. The results show that the use of expander graphs can significantly improve the reliability of memory structures. The study concludes that expander graphs are a promising tool for building reliable memories from unreliable components, and that further research is needed to explore their full potential in this area.
364	We present an one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo model for capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The model quantitatively describes the central part of the discharge. For a given voltage and pressure, it self-consistently determines the electric potential and the distribution functions for electrons, negatively charged atomic oxygen, and positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used collision cross sections are critically assessed and in some cases modified. Provided associative detachment due to metastable oxygen molecules is included in the model, the electro-negativities in the center of the discharge are in excellent agreement with experiments. Due to lack of empirical data for the cross section of this process, we propose a simple model and discuss its limitations.
2066	This research paper investigates the collective excitations of hard-core bosons at half filling on square and triangular lattices. Using numerical simulations, the paper shows that as the strength of the interactions between the bosons is increased, a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum develops. The paper also finds that this roton minimum collapses at a critical interaction strength, leading to a breakdown of the superfluid state. Additionally, the paper compares the behavior of the bosons on square and triangular lattices, finding that the triangular lattice has a larger roton gap and a stronger tendency towards superfluidity. The results of this study have implications for understanding the behavior of strongly interacting bosons in condensed matter systems.

The research findings highlight the importance of understanding the behavior of geodesics on an ellipsoid, which has significant implications in various fields of physics, including relativity and cosmology. The paper concludes by discussing potential applications of the research findings in the development of new technologies and scientific discoveries.
997	"The research paper titled ""Large deviation generating function for energy transport in the Pauli-Fierz model"" focuses on studying the energy transport in a system of interacting particles known as the Pauli-Fierz model. The authors use mathematical techniques to derive a large deviation generating function that describes the probability of observing a particular energy transport in the system. They also investigate the behavior of the generating function in different limits and identify the dominant energy transport mechanisms. The main conclusion of the study is that the behavior of the generating function is consistent with the existence of two distinct energy transport mechanisms, one that is diffusive and another that is ballistic. These findings provide insights into the fundamental properties of energy transport in interacting particle systems, which have important implications for various fields of physics and engineering."
2359	This research paper aims to investigate the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes using a tight-binding grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation approach. The primary focus of the study is to understand the effect of the catalyst nanoparticles' size, type, and concentration on the growth of carbon nanotubes. The significant findings of the study indicate that the optimal catalyst size and concentration play a crucial role in the carbon nanotube's growth, which is consistent with experimental observations. The study also suggests that the use of a binary catalyst system can enhance the growth rate and length of carbon nanotubes. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes and can facilitate the design and optimization of nanotube synthesis techniques.

3394	Results are presented for the leading two-loop contributions of O(alpha_t alpha_s) to the masses and mixing effects in the Higgs sector of the MSSM with complex parameters. They are obtained in the Feynman-diagrammatic approach using on-shell renormalization. The full dependence on all complex phases is taken into account. The renormalization of the appropriate contributions of the Higgs-boson sector and the scalar top and bottom sector is discussed. Our numerical analysis for the lightest MSSM Higgs-boson mass is based on the new two-loop corrections, supplemented by the full one-loop result. The corrections induced by the phase variation in the scalar top sector are enhanced by the two-loop contributions. We find that the corresponding shift in M_h1 can amount to 5 GeV.
3197	We consider an anisotropic brane world with Bianchi type I and V geometries where the mechanism of confining the matter on the brane is through the use of a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the special case of a Bianchi type I the solutions of the field equations are obtained in an exact analytic form. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally important parameters.
1843	Considering a separable and purely kinetic 5D scalar field on a warped product metric background we propose a new and more general approach for inducing 4D scalar potentials on a 4D constant foliation of the 5D space-time. We obtain an induced potential for a true 4D scalar field instead of a potential for an effective 4D scalar field. In this formalism we can recover the usual 4D inflationary formalism with a geometrically induced inflationary potential. In addition the quantum confinement of the inflaton modes is obtained naturally from the model for at least a class of warping factors. Besides the 4D inflationary physics that results of this formalism is independent of the 4D-hypersurface chosen.
2698	The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial dislocations.
1760	A ToO observation of the TeV-emitting blazar Mrk 421 with INTEGRAL was triggered in June 2006 by an increase of the RXTE count rate to more than 30 mCrab. The source was then observed with all INTEGRAL instruments with the exception of the spectrometer SPI for a total exposure of 829 ks. During this time several outbursts were observed by IBIS and JEM-X. Multiwavelength observations were immediately triggered and the source was observed at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths up to TeV energies. The data obtained during these observations are analysed with respect to spectral evolution and correlated variability. Preliminary results of the analysis are presented in this poster.
2508	When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing, \lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles.
629	This research paper investigates the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks under quality-of-service constraints. The proposed approach aims to minimize the energy consumption of network nodes while ensuring the satisfaction of QoS requirements for all users. The paper presents a joint optimization model for allocating power and bandwidth resources, taking into account the channel conditions, traffic characteristics, and QoS parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which show significant energy savings compared to other existing methods, while maintaining high QoS levels. The results of this study can be useful for designing energy-efficient wireless networks that can support diverse applications with different QoS requirements.
3218	This paper explores the intersection of geometry, quantum mechanics, and neuroscience to investigate the phenomenon known as the quantum Zeno effect. Specifically, we examine the role of the axiom of choice in the geometry of time and its implications for the neuro-biological basis of the quantum Zeno effect. Using mathematical models and empirical evidence from neuroscientific studies, we argue that the quantum Zeno effect is intimately tied to the structure of time and the way in which the brain processes information. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of the geometry of time and the quantum Zeno effect could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of more powerful quantum computing technologies.
D2-91	The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state known as a singularity. This singularity then rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, causing space itself to stretch exponentially in a fraction of a second. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing matter to form, leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and eventually the structure of the universe we observe today. Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes the cosmic microwave background radiation (a faint glow left over from the early universe), the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
710	"The research paper titled ""A study of uranium-based multilayers: II. Magnetic properties"" presents an investigation of the magnetic properties of uranium-based multilayers. The study focused on the magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions in these multilayers. The researchers used various techniques such as magnetometry, x-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering to analyze the samples. The results showed that the multilayers exhibited a strong magnetic anisotropy and that the exchange interactions between the uranium layers were antiferromagnetic. The study also found that the magnetic properties of the multilayers were strongly influenced by the thickness of the uranium layers and the composition of the spacer layers. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the magnetic properties of uranium-based multilayers, which could have important implications for the development of new materials for magnetic storage and other applications."
468	This research paper presents QMC, a model checker specifically designed for quantum systems.

The key findings of this work show that QMC is a promising tool for verifying quantum systems, and it can handle larger quantum circuits than existing model checkers. Overall, this paper demonstrates that model checking can be a useful technique for ensuring the correctness of quantum systems.
2763	A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and dissipated in the outer solar layers. Progress in this field has been slow and painstaking. However, advances in computer hardware and numerical methods, vastly increased observational capabilities and growing physical insight seem finally to be leading towards understanding. Here we present exploratory numerical MHD models that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE radiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin radiative losses as well as magnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the transition region and corona.
1847	Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking. Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the correlation with more predictive procedures.
3268	This research paper presents a physically sound Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamical Casimir effect, a phenomenon where a vacuum is induced to produce real particles due to the time-varying boundary conditions of a cavity. The primary theme of the paper is to develop a rigorous mathematical framework that accurately describes the dynamics of the system and provides a physically intuitive understanding of the effect. The research findings suggest that the proposed Hamiltonian formulation provides a more accurate and complete description of the dynamical Casimir effect compared to previous formulations. The conclusions drawn from the study provide valuable insights into the physics of the effect and can aid in the design and development of experimental systems to observe the phenomenon.
632	We determine from Polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity. Their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Moreover we study the inverse decay length of the correlation between the real parts and between the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compare the results with expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.
1869	The paper focuses on studying the Dirac quasinormal modes of a D-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The authors use a numerical method to calculate the quasinormal frequencies and investigate their dependence on the dimensions of the spacetime and the mass of the Dirac field. They find that the quasinormal frequencies for the Dirac field are different from those of a scalar field, which has been previously studied. The authors also discuss the physical implications of their results, including the potential for future observations of these quasinormal frequencies in astrophysical contexts. Overall, the paper provides new insights into the behavior of Dirac fields in de Sitter spacetime and their potential observational signatures.
143	We show that a quantum state may be represented as the sum of a joint probability and a complex quantum modification term. The joint probability and the modification term can both be observed in successive projective measurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurement disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part. This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as a nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significance of the Schwinger basis.
2519	This research paper evaluates the validity of the axial vector commutator sum rule (AVCSR) in describing pion-pion scattering. The AVCSR is a widely accepted theoretical framework that relates the pion-pion scattering amplitude to the pion decay constant and the electromagnetic form factor of the pion. The authors analyze experimental data from the pion-pion scattering process and compare it with the predictions of the AVCSR. They find that the AVCSR provides a good description of the scattering data, supporting its validity as a theoretical tool for understanding pion-pion interactions.

D2-7	Spermidine synthases are essential enzymes that function as aminopropyltransferases, transferring aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structurally, these enzymes contain a SAM-MT fold and typically form homodimers. The mechanism follows an SN2 reaction pathway where spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine The human spermidine synthase is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor.

620	Controlled Lagrangian and matching techniques are developed for the stabilization of relative equilibria and equilibria of discrete mechanical systems with symmetry as well as broken symmetry. Interesting new phenomena arise in the controlled Lagrangian approach in the discrete context that are not present in the continuous theory. In particular, to make the discrete theory effective, one can make an appropriate selection of momentum levels or, alternatively, introduce a new parameter into the controlled Lagrangian to complete the kinetic matching procedure. Specifically, new terms in the controlled shape equation that are necessary for potential matching in the discrete setting are introduced. The theory is illustrated with the problem of stabilization of the cart-pendulum system on an incline. The paper also discusses digital and model predictive controllers.
3678	Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis.

One-way permutations are mathematical functions that are easy to compute in one direction but difficult to invert. The paper explores the properties of one-way permutations and their applications in cryptography and computer security. The research concludes that one-way permutations provide a powerful tool for protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access to data. It also highlights the need for continued research into the design and analysis of one-way permutations to ensure their effectiveness in the face of evolving threats.
3854	Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.
2420	We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the status of fundamental physics law.
3598	Magneto-optical imaging was used to observe dendritic flux avalanches connecting the outer and inner edges of a ring-shaped superconducting MgB2 film. Such avalanches create heated channels across the entire width of the ring, and inject large amounts of flux into the central hole. By measuring the injected flux and the corresponding reduction of current, which is typically 15%, we estimate the maximum temperature in the channel to be 100 K, and the duration of the process to be on the order of a microsecond. Flux creep simulations reproduce all the observed features in the current density before and after injection events.

3997	"Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature. The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer theories. They have then listed 9 ""absolute discrepancies"" for such cancer theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out."
1274	We present the results of six-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 3C~66A. The high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) maps obtained at multi-frequency (2.3, 8.4, and 22.2 GHz) simultaneously enabled us to identify the brightest compact component with the core. We find that the spectrum of the core can be reasonably fitted by the synchrotron self-absorption model. Our VLBA maps show that the jet of 3C~66A has two bendings at about 1.2 and 4 mas from the core. We also give possible identifications of our jet components with the components in previous VLBA observations by analysing their proper motions. We find consistent differences of the position from the core in one component between different frequencies at six epochs.
3564	The non-Abelian feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results in the gluons losing more energy than quarks in the medium formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Experimental results in p+p collisions when compared to NLO pQCD calculations show that at high transverse momentum (pT) the produced protons+anti-protons are dominantly from gluon jets and charged pions have substantial contribution from quark jets. If such a scenario is applied to heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, one would expect the difference in quark and gluon energy loss to have an effect on measured observables, such as high pT pbar(p)/pi ratios and the nuclear modification factor for various particles species. We discuss the experimental results and some possible future measurements.
3151	This research paper explores the historical significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 in the development of the concept of gravitational lensing. Through a detailed analysis of historical records and scientific literature, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the observations and interpretations of the nova's behavior, which led to the groundbreaking proposal of the bending of light by gravity. The critical outcomes of this research affirm the significance of Nova Geminorum 1912 as a pivotal event in the history of astrophysics, as it initiated the theoretical framework for gravitational lensing, which has since been confirmed through numerous observations and experiments. This paper concludes that the discovery of Nova Geminorum 1912 and subsequent research in gravitational lensing have broadened our understanding of the universe and opened new avenues for scientific inquiry.
3338	"The research paper titled ""Bimodality in spectator fragmentation"" investigates the phenomenon of bimodal fragmentation in high-energy particle collisions.

The study also highlights the potential of bimodality as a tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions and have important implications for ongoing research in particle physics."
2392	We calculate the very high energy (sub-GeV to TeV) inverse Compton emission of GRB afterglows. We argue that this emission provides a powerful test of the currently accepted afterglow model. We focus on two processes: synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission within the afterglow blast wave, and external inverse Compton (EIC) emission which occurs when flare photons (produced by an internal process) pass through the blast wave. We show that if our current interpretations of the Swift XRT data are correct, there should be a canonical high energy afterglow emission light curve. Our predictions can be tested with high energy observatories such as GLAST, Whipple, H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. Under favorable conditions we expect afterglow detections in all these detectors.
2876	The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well with a diluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation with an in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positively charged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fast oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing times up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole g factor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of hole localization at cryogenic temperatures.
3386	Using AdS/CFT correspondence and the Euclidean action formalism for black hole entropy Kraus and Larsen have argued that the entropy of a BTZ black hole in three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry does not receive any correction from higher derivative terms in the action. We argue that as a consequence of AdS/CFT correspondence the action of a three dimensional supergravity with (0,4) supersymmetry cannot receive any higher derivative correction except for those which can be removed by field redefinition. The non-renormalization of the entropy then follows as a consequence of this and the invariance of Wald's formula under a field redefinition.
1267	"We show that if a meromorphic function has a direct singularity over infinity, then the escaping set has an unbounded component and the intersection of the escaping set with the Julia set contains continua. This intersection has an unbounded component if and only if the function has no Baker wandering domains. We also give estimates of the Hausdorff dimension and the upper box dimension of the Julia set of a meromorphic function with a logarithmic singularity over infinity. The above theorems are deduced from more general results concerning functions which have ""direct or logarithmic tracts"", but which need not be meromorphic in the plane. These results are obtained by using a generalization of Wiman-Valiron theory. The method is also applied to complex differential equations."
3784	This research paper discusses the robust manipulation of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of singly charged quantum dots. The study found that by applying a series of tailored microwave pulses, the electron spin coherence in the quantum dots can be precisely manipulated and maintained over long periods of time. This manipulation of spin coherence is important for the development of quantum information processing technologies. The paper also introduces a new method for measuring the coherence time of these spins, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of quantum dots in practical applications. Overall, the research shows promising results for the future development of quantum technologies.
3653	The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.
294	This research paper presents a method for determining the frequency distribution function of supernova (SNe) explosions based on numerical simulations. The study finds that the SNe frequency distribution function can be approximated by a power law with an index of -1.9, which is consistent with previous observational studies. The simulations also show that the frequency of Type Ia SNe is higher than that of Type II SNe, which may have important implications for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Overall, the study provides new insights into the frequency distribution of SNe and highlights the importance of numerical simulations in astrophysical research.
2646	This research paper explores a language-based approach for enhancing the resilience of network application protocol implementations. The proposed method employs a programming language that enforces stronger type safety and contracts to minimize errors and vulnerabilities in the protocol implementation.

Results indicate that the language-based approach can significantly reduce the number of errors and improve the overall stability and security of the protocol. The findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of network protocols, particularly in the context of cybersecurity and network reliability.
252	This research paper investigates the behavior of magneto-elastic waves in crystals of magnetic molecules. Through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, we identify the specific characteristics of these waves and their effect on the magnetic properties of the crystal. Our results reveal the crucial role of magneto-elastic coupling in the understanding of magnetic materials and provide insights into the potential applications of these waves in magneto-electronics and spintronics. Overall, this study highlights the significance of magneto-elastic waves in the field of condensed matter physics and serves as a vital step towards developing advanced magnetic materials and devices.
1394	This research paper presents the results of the analysis of three transits of the exoplanet TrES-2 as part of The Transit Light Curve Project. Observations were conducted using the Kepler Space Telescope and the light curve was analyzed using various techniques to determine the planet's physical characteristics, such as its size, orbital period, and atmospheric composition. The results indicate that TrES-2 is a gas giant planet with a radius of 1.19 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 2.47 days. The planet's atmosphere was found to be largely composed of hydrogen and helium, with a possible presence of water vapor. The findings provide valuable insights into the properties of exoplanets and contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
2899	The research paper presents a Finite Element framework for computing protein normal modes and mechanical response. The main theme of the paper is to develop a method that can accurately calculate the normal modes of proteins, which are essential for understanding protein function and dynamics. The paper uses a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Finite Element Analysis to compute the normal modes of proteins. The results show that the proposed method is effective in accurately calculating the normal modes of proteins. Furthermore, the paper also explores the mechanical response of proteins under different loading conditions. The conclusion of the paper is that the developed method can be a useful tool in understanding the mechanical properties of proteins and their response to external stimuli.
2866	Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.
2088	We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.
1351	A discrete Laplace transform and its inversion formula are obtained by using a quadrature of the continuous Fourier transform which is given in terms of Hermite polynomials and its zeros. This approach yields a convergent discrete formula for the two-sided Laplace transform if the function to be transformed falls off rapidly to zero and satisfy certain conditions of integrability, achieving convergence also for singular functions. The inversion formula becomes a quadrature formula for the Bromwich integral. This procedure also yields a quadrature formula for the Mellin transform and its corresponding inversion formula that can be generalized straightforwardly for functions of several variables.
1849	We study five-dimensional black holes obtained by compactifying M theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Recent progress in solving topological string theory on compact, one-parameter models allows us to test numerically various conjectures about these black holes. We give convincing evidence that a microscopic description based on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants accounts correctly for their macroscopic entropy, and we check that highly nontrivial cancellations -which seem necessary to resolve the so-called entropy enigma in the OSV conjecture- do in fact occur. We also study analytically small 5d black holes obtained by wrapping M2 branes in the fiber of K3 fibrations. By using heterotic/type II duality we obtain exact formulae for the microscopic degeneracies in various geometries, and we compute their asymptotic expansion for large charges.
906	"The detection and estimation of signals in noisy, limited data is a problem of interest to many scientific and engineering communities. We present a computationally simple, sample eigenvalue based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise when there are relatively few samples. We highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based detection of weak high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size and discuss its implication for the detection of two closely spaced signals. This motivates our heuristic definition of the 'effective number of identifiable signals.' Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the consistency of the algorithm with respect to the effective number of signals and the superior performance of the algorithm with respect to Wax and Kailath's ""asymptotically consistent"" MDL based estimator."
3547	This research paper focuses on investigating the charging behavior of a quantum dot coupled to Luttinger liquid leads. The study employs a theoretical approach to analyze the electron transport properties of the system and explores the effects of Coulomb interactions on the charging dynamics. The results reveal that the charging energy of the quantum dot is significantly influenced by the coupling strength and the Luttinger parameter of the leads. Furthermore, the study indicates that the charging process can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage and the magnetic field. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the physics of charge transport in quantum dot systems and can be useful in the development of future quantum devices.
649	"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestr""om-Kakeya theorem."
3066	This research paper investigates the polarization properties of subwavelength hole arrays composed of rectangular holes. The study explores the effects of the angle of incidence and the dimensions of the holes on the transmission and polarization properties of the arrays. The results demonstrate that the polarization properties of the arrays are highly dependent on the shape and orientation of the holes. The study also suggests that subwavelength hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes can be utilized for controlling the polarization of light in a variety of optical devices. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of subwavelength hole arrays for applications in polarization-sensitive optical systems.
D2-78	Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications. The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life.
1198	"We introduce the idea of using adiabatic rotation to generate superpositions of a large class of quantum states. For quantum computing this is an interesting alternative to the well-studied ""straight line"" adiabatic evolution. In ways that complement recent results, we show how to efficiently prepare three types of states: Kitaev's toric code state, the cluster state of the measurement-based computation model and the history state used in the adiabatic simulation of quantum circuit. We also show that the method, when adapted for quantum search, provides quadratic speedup as other optimal methods do with the advantages that the problem Hamiltonian is time-independent and that the energy gap above the ground state is strictly nondecreasing with time. Likewise the method can be used for optimization as an alternative to the usual adiabatic algorithm."
291	"Edge casing is a well-known method to improve the readability of drawings of non-planar graphs. A cased drawing orders the edges of each edge crossing and interrupts the lower edge in an appropriate neighborhood of the crossing. Certain orders will lead to a more readable drawing than others. We formulate several optimization criteria that try to capture the concept of a ""good"" cased drawing. Further, we address the algorithmic question of how to turn a given drawing into an optimal cased drawing. For many of the resulting optimization problems, we either find polynomial time algorithms or NP-hardness results."
D2-4	Many cross sectional and prospective studies have confirmed the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese: more than 85% of people with type 2 diabetes in southeast Scotland in 2005 had a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared) of over 25. Recent evidence indicates that high waist circumference may be an even better indicator than body mass index (BMI) of increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes over a 14 year follow-up period in the nurses' health study was 49 times higher among women whose baseline BMI was >35 than among women whose baseline BMI was <22.
1070	This research paper aims to compare two popular techniques for handling missing data in machine learning: neural network and expectation maximization (EM). The study will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. The paper will also investigate how these techniques can be applied in real-world scenarios and provide recommendations for selecting the most appropriate approach based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the research objectives. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a better understanding of missing data handling techniques and provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning.
1339	We systematically evaluate the potential energy at the touching configuration for heavy-ion reactions using various potential models. We point out that the energy at the touching point, especially that estimated with the Krappe-Nix-Sierk (KNS) potential, strongly correlates with the threshold incident energy for steep fall-off of fusion cross sections observed recently for several systems at extremely low energies. This clearly indicates that the steep fall-off phenomenon can be attributed to the dynamics after the target and projectile touch with each other, e.g., the tunneling process and the nuclear saturation property in the overlap region.
2706	The dynamics of quasicrystals is characterized by the existence of phason excitations in addition to the usual phonon modes. In order to investigate their interplay on an elementary level we resort to various one-dimensional model systems. The main observables are the static, the incoherent, and the coherent structure factor, which are extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic periodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic and anharmonic interaction potentials. In the dynamic Fibonacci chain neighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips. The difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic Fibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width. If a bias is introduced in the well depth, dispersionless optic phonon bands split off.
445	Spherically symmetric transonic accretion of a fractal medium has been studied in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary transonic solution is greatly sensitive to infinitesimal deviations in the outer boundary condition, but the flow becomes transonic and stable, when its evolution is followed through time. The evolution towards transonicity is more pronounced for a fractal medium than what is it for a continuum. The dynamic approach also shows that there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of motion for a perturbation in the flow, and the metric of an analogue acoustic black hole. The stationary inflow solutions of a fractal medium are as much stable under the influence of linearised perturbations, as they are for the fluid continuum.
3540	Holzer and Holzer (Discrete Applied Mathematics 144(3):345--358, 2004) proved that the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the solution, which implies that the unique Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP.
1410	"The research paper titled ""L'identit  alg brique d'une pratique port e par la discussion sur l' quation   l'aide de laquelle on d termine les in galit s s culaires des plan tes (1766-1874)"" examines the historical development of mathematical practices used to determine the secular inequalities of planets between 1766 and 1874. The paper shows how the use of algebraic identities played a crucial role in the development of these practices and the determination of planetary motion. The research concludes that the use of algebraic identities was essential in creating a mathematical framework for understanding the secular inequalities of planets and that this framework had a significant impact on the development of celestial mechanics."
1333	Minimum cost distributed source coding over a network is a research paper that focuses on optimizing the coding rate of a distributed source coding system over a network while minimizing the total communication cost. The paper proposes a new algorithm, called the Minimum Cost Distributed Source Coding (MC-DSC) algorithm, that achieves this optimization by iteratively updating the coding rate and the transmitting nodes' selection. The algorithm also takes into account the correlation between the source nodes and the channel noise to further optimize the coding rate. The paper concludes that the MC-DSC algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of communication cost while maintaining a high reconstruction quality. This paper's findings are significant because they can be applied in various fields that involve distributed source coding, such as wireless sensor networks and multimedia communications.
1346	The study focuses on analyzing the ultraviolet spectra of ten dwarf novae in outburst using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite. The researchers aimed to investigate the physical properties of the accretion disks and white dwarf stars that are responsible for the outbursts. They discovered that the spectra of the dwarf novae showed evidence of emission from accretion disks, white dwarfs, and hot gas. The study also revealed that the outbursts of dwarf novae are caused by the instabilities in the accretion disks. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the physics of accretion disks and help to better understand the behavior of dwarf novae.
3192	Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.
1584	Charge redistribution at interfaces is crucial for electronic applications of high-Tc superconductors, since the band structure is modified on a local scale. We address the normal-state electronic structure of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) at an YBCO-metal contact by first principles calculations for prototypical interface configurations. We derive quantitative results for the intrinsic doping of the superconducting CuO2 planes due to the metal contact.

We provide theoretical analysis and simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting and identifying the change points. Our findings have implications for various applications, such as signal processing and anomaly detection, where the ability to detect and identify changes in data distributions is critical.
1054	This research paper explores the potential existence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and their implications for particle physics. The Lee-Wick model predicts the existence of a tower of excited states for each gauge boson, which could explain some of the observed anomalies in current experimental data. We present a detailed analysis of the LHC data, focusing on the search for resonant peaks in the invariant mass distribution of the final state particles. We find no evidence of Lee-Wick gauge bosons in the current data, placing stringent limits on the model parameters. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of new physics models beyond the Standard Model.

2915	A theory of collective states in a magnetically quantized two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with half-filled Landau level (quantized Hall ferromagnet) in the presence of magnetic 3d impurities is developed. The spectrum of bound and delocalized spin-excitons as well as the renormalization of Zeeman splitting of the impurity 3d levels due to the indirect exchange interaction with the 2DEG are studied for the specific case of n-type GaAs doped with Mn where the Lande` g-factors of impurity and 2DEG have opposite signs. If the sign of the 2DEG g-factor is changed due to external influences, then impurity related transitions to new ground state phases, presenting various spin-flip and skyrmion-like textures, are possible. Conditions for existence of these phases are discussed. PACS: 73.43.Lp, 73.21.Fg, 72.15.Rn

3986	Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.

The study concludes that the prismatic drive offers a promising alternative to traditional linear actuators, with potential for further optimization and improvement.
3437	The two dimensional analog of the Hadamard state condition is used to specify the local Hadamard states associated with a linear quantum field coupled to a two dimensional gravitational background. To characterize a local Hadamard state corresponding to a physical vacuum state, we apply a superselection rule in which the state dependent part of the two-point function is determined in terms of a dynamical scalar field. It implies a basic connection between the vacuum state and a scalar field coupled to gravity. We study the characteristics of the Hadamard vacuum state through this superselection rule using two different background metrics, the two dimensional analog of the schwarzschild and FRW metric.

Using computer simulations and theoretical models, the authors demonstrate that cold denaturation is caused by a decrease in protein solvation due to the formation of ice-like water structures around the protein. They also propose a new model for predicting the temperature at which cold denaturation occurs based on protein size and shape. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the physical principles that govern protein stability, which could have implications for fields such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.

To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex formation.

The study concludes that the understanding of collective oscillations in disordered Bose-Einstein condensed gases is important for the development of future applications in areas such as quantum computing and precision metrology.
D1-3	Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.
2426	We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple and general tool for lifting additivity results.

2483	A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the Hubble scale at the transition.
313	In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.

3846	It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
265	We study the computation of the static quark potential under decimations in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG). Employing a multi-representation plaquette action, we find that fine-tuning the decimation prescription so that the MCRG equilibrium self-consistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances. In particular, lattice coarsening (change of effective lattice spacing on action-generated lattices after decimation) is nearly eliminated. Failure to correctly tune the decimation, on the other hand, produces large coarsening effects, of order 50% or more, consistent with those seen in previous studies. We also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances, where no particular improvement is seen for this action.
789	We study the motion of small particles in a random turbulent flow assuming linear law of friction. We derive a symmetry relation obeyed by the large deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponents in the phase space. The relation applies when either the statistics of the strain matrix is invariant under the transposition or when it is time-reversible. We show that, as a result, the Lyapunov exponents come in pairs which sum is equal to minus the inverse relaxation time of the particles. We use the pairing to consider the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the particles attractor in the phase space. In particular, the results apply to case of the flow which is white noise in time.

1401	Feature tracking and recognition are increasingly common tools for data analysis, but are typically implemented on an ad-hoc basis by individual research groups, limiting the usefulness of derived results when selection effects and algorithmic differences are not controlled. Specific results that are affected include the solar magnetic turnover time, the distributions of sizes, strengths, and lifetimes of magnetic features, and the physics of both small scale flux emergence and the small-scale dynamo. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed comparison between four tracking codes applied to a single set of data from SOHO/MDI, describe the interplay between desired tracking behavior and parameterization of tracking algorithms, and make recommendations for feature selection and tracking practice in future work.
3064	A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D, contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

Our findings reveal that UED models with right-handed neutrinos can produce the correct dark matter relic abundance, and that the observed baryon asymmetry can be generated through leptogenesis. These results have significant implications for the search for dark matter and the study of the origin of matter in the universe.

1279	The random initialization of weights of a multilayer perceptron makes it possible to model its training process as a Las Vegas algorithm, i.e. a randomized algorithm which stops when some required training error is obtained, and whose execution time is a random variable. This modeling is used to perform a case study on a well-known pattern recognition benchmark: the UCI Thyroid Disease Database. Empirical evidence is presented of the training time probability distribution exhibiting a heavy tail behavior, meaning a big probability mass of long executions. This fact is exploited to reduce the training time cost by applying two simple restart strategies. The first assumes full knowledge of the distribution yielding a 40% cut down in expected time with respect to the training without restarts. The second, assumes null knowledge, yielding a reduction ranging from 9% to 23%.
2681	This research paper explores the phenomenon of photo-assisted shot noise in Coulomb interacting systems. By using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study demonstrates that the interplay between Coulomb interactions and photo-assisted transport can lead to a non-trivial dependence of shot noise on the photo-excitation power. This effect is found to be robust against variations in system parameters and can be used as a tool to probe the underlying physics of the system. The results provide important insights into the behavior of correlated systems under external perturbations and have potential implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
616	Magnetic domain patterns under an oscillating field is studied theoretically by using a simple Ising-like model. We propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field. The first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out, and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns. The second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field, and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field.
3276	This paper investigates the use of poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a finite cylinder. In particular, we focus on the development of influence matrices for the decomposition, which can be used to identify the impact of various physical and geometric parameters on the MHD equations. We present a detailed derivation of the influence matrices, as well as numerical simulations to demonstrate their efficacy. Our results highlight the importance of considering the poloidal-toroidal decomposition in the analysis of MHD equations in a finite cylinder, and provide a valuable tool for future research in this area.
1976	We demonstrate that the strong anomalies in the high frequency LO-phonon spectrum in cuprate superconductors can in principle be explained by the enhanced electronic polarizability associated with the self-organized one dimensionality of metallic stripes. Contrary to the current interpretation in terms of transversal stripe fluctuations, the anomaly should occur at momenta parallel to the stripes. The doping dependence of the anomaly is naturally explained, and we predict that the phonon line-width and the spread of the anomaly in the transverse momentum decrease with increasing temperature while high resolution measurements should reveal a characteristic substructure to the anomaly.
1672	In a series of recent papers, a new formalism has been developed that explains the inner structure of dark matter halos as collisionless, dissipationless systems assembled through mergers and accretion at the typical cosmological rate. Nearby ellipticals are also collisionless, dissipationless systems assembling their mass through mergers, but contrarily to the former structures they do not continuously accrete external matter because they are shielded by their host halos. Here we explore the idea that the infall of their own matter ejected within the halo on the occasion of a violent merger can play a role similar to external accretion in halos. The predicted stellar mass density profile fits the observed one, and the empirical total mass density profile is also recovered.
2445	This research paper reports on the observation of an anti-correlation between scintillation and ionization for MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon. The study involved measurements of the energy deposition and scintillation light production in liquid xenon using a gamma-ray source. The results showed that the scintillation light yield decreased as the ionization yield increased, indicating an anti-correlation between the two. The authors suggest that this anti-correlation may be due to the recombination of electrons and ions in the liquid xenon. These findings have important implications for the development of liquid xenon-based detectors for dark matter searches and other applications.
850	The article discusses the potential of two long period, massive binary systems (HD 37366 and HD 54662) as targets for long baseline optical interferometry. The authors analyze the available data on these systems, including photometric and spectroscopic observations, to determine their physical parameters and orbital properties. They then explore how these systems could be studied using interferometry techniques to gain further insights into their properties and evolution. The authors conclude that both HD 37366 and HD 54662 are excellent targets for interferometry observations and could provide valuable information about the physics of massive binary systems. Overall, the article highlights the importance of using advanced observational techniques to better understand the properties and evolution of binary star systems.
1486	Light and cold extrasolar planets such as OGLE 2005-BLG-390Lb, a 5.5 Earth-mass planet detected via microlensing, could be frequent in the Galaxy according to some preliminary results from microlensing experiments. These planets can be frozen rocky- or ocean-planets, situated beyond the snow line and, therefore, beyond the habitable zone of their system. They can nonetheless host a layer of liquid water, heated by radiogenic energy, underneath an ice shell surface for billions of years, before freezing completely. These results suggest that oceans under ice, like those suspected to be present on icy moons in the Solar system, could be a common feature of cold low-mass extrasolar planets.
108	The study focuses on the stability of poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars. The researchers used numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of these fields in different rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. They found that in some cases, the poloidal magnetic fields can become unstable and create toroidal magnetic fields, which can lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field from the star. This process is known as the Tayler instability. The researchers also found that the strength of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the poloidal magnetic field. The study's outcomes suggest that poloidal magnetic fields in rotating stars can be unstable and lead to the expulsion of the magnetic field, which can have significant implications for star formation and evolution.
2438	"We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium. The general nature of the solution is similar to the ""Bondi solution"", but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars."
88	This research paper presents a study on the constraints of dark energy from cosmic shear power spectra. The impact of intrinsic alignments on photometric redshift requirements is also analyzed. The study shows that the inclusion of intrinsic alignment contaminants in the analysis of cosmic shear data significantly affects the precision of the dark energy constraints. The results suggest that accurate photometric redshifts are essential for obtaining robust constraints on dark energy. This research contributes to the understanding of the nature of dark energy and emphasizes the importance of improving the accuracy of photometric redshift estimations in future cosmic shear surveys.

The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of the process in different scenarios and to compare the results obtained using different expansion techniques. The study shows that the behavior of the pair-creation contact process is highly dependent on the parameters of the system and the expansion technique used. The outcomes of this study provide insights into the behavior of the pair-creation contact process and can be used to improve the understanding of similar processes in different systems. Overall, the results suggest that the use of series expansions can be an effective tool for studying the behavior of complex systems and can provide valuable insights into their dynamics.
848	This research paper presents a detailed analysis of P2P IPTV traffic, focusing on the scaling properties of the traffic. The authors use real-world data obtained from a large-scale P2P IPTV system to investigate the behavior of the traffic as the number of users and channels increase. They find that the traffic exhibits self-similarity, which can be used to model the traffic and predict its behavior under different conditions. The results have important implications for the design and management of P2P IPTV systems, as they demonstrate the need for scalable solutions that can handle large numbers of users and channels. The study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of P2P IPTV traffic, which can be used to optimize network performance and enhance the user experience.
905	"The research paper ""Milnor Invariants for Spatial Graphs"" explores the concept of Milnor invariants for spatial graphs, which are graphs embedded in three-dimensional space. The paper presents a method for computing the Milnor invariants of spatial graphs using the Jones polynomial, a well-known invariant in knot theory. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to compute the Milnor invariants for a variety of spatial graphs. The paper concludes that the Milnor invariants provide a powerful tool for distinguishing between non-isomorphic spatial graphs and may have applications in areas such as materials science and computer science."
370	We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M 2-9 and may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.
3795	We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.
3229	"We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a Gr\""obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome."
3606	Although there is mounting observational evidence that the cosmic expansion is undergoing a late-time acceleration, the physical mechanism behind such a phenomenon is yet unknown. In this paper, we investigate a holographic dark energy (HDE) model with interaction between the components of the dark sector in the light of current cosmological observations. We use both the new \emph{gold} sample of 182 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the 192 SNe Ia ESSENCE data, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the shift parameter from the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. In agreement with previous results, we show that these observations suggest a very weak coupling or even a noninteracting HDE. The phantom crossing behavior in the context of these scenarios is also briefly discussed.
1469	As an AI language model, I do not have access to a specific research paper as context. However, based on the title, the Deformation Principle and further geometrization of physics suggest that the paper might explore the idea of using the principles of deformation and geometry to enhance the understanding of physics. This might involve using mathematical models to describe physical phenomena and understanding the underlying geometric structures that govern them. The paper might also discuss the potential applications of these ideas in various fields of physics, including particle physics and cosmology. The key results or conclusions of the research paper might include new insights into the nature of physical phenomena and the development of more accurate and comprehensive models for understanding them.
3889	We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.
1991	Improved actions in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theories are investigated with an emphasis on asymptotic scaling. A new scheme for tadpole improvement is proposed. The standard but heuristic tadpole improvement emerges from a mean field approximation from the new approach. Scaling is investigated by means of the large distance static quark potential. Both, the generic and the new tadpole scheme yield significant improvements on asymptotic scaling when compared with loop improved actions. A study of the rotational symmetry breaking terms, however, reveals that only the new improvement scheme efficiently eliminates the leading irrelevant term from the action.
2231	This research paper focuses on the order of the 2D polymer escape transition, which refers to the point at which a polymer chain escapes from a confining boundary. The study uses computer simulations to investigate the critical properties of the transition and the effects of various parameters, such as chain length and confinement size. The findings suggest that the order of the transition depends on the degree of confinement and that longer chains require larger confinements to exhibit a second-order transition. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the escape transition in various physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and biological membranes. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the fundamental properties of polymer chains in confined environments and has potential applications in materials science and biophysics.
1022	We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum correlations in the parametric luminescence from semiconductor microcavities in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime. As already demonstrated in recent experiments, a ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the signal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold, accounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and static disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo simulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.
1588	"The research paper titled ""The causal boundary of product spacetimes"" investigates the causal boundary of product spacetimes, which are commonly used in mathematical physics and general relativity.

The main conclusion of the paper is that the causal boundary of product spacetimes provides important insights into the nature of spacetime and its geometric properties."
640	This research paper presents a novel algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor networks that possesses the gradient property. The algorithm is designed to efficiently synchronize the clocks of nodes in a network, even when there are communication delays and counter errors. The proposed algorithm utilizes the gradient property to detect and adjust clock drifts, resulting in accurate and precise synchronization among nodes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through various simulations and experiments, which show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the reliability and performance of clock synchronization in sensor networks, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
523	In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of accelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of space-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe. This interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some experimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated expansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale.
1840	This research paper presents a study on the thermodynamic properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) superconductor, which is highly desirable for various technological applications. The electronic dispersion of BSCCO was calculated using a first-principles approach to obtain the band structure. Based on the electronic dispersion, various thermodynamic properties were calculated, including the specific heat, entropy, and free energy. The results show that the specific heat and entropy of BSCCO are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, the calculated free energy provides valuable information on the stability of the superconducting state. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of BSCCO and enhance the potential for its use in various technological applications.
1057	The Landau-Zener(LZ) transition of a two-level system coupling to spin chains near their critical points is studied in this paper. Two kinds of spin chains, the Ising spin chain and XY spin chain, are considered. We calculate and analyze the effects of system-chain coupling on the LZ transition. A relation between the LZ transition and the critical points of the spin chain is established. These results suggest that LZ transitions may serve as the witnesses of criticality of the spin chain. This may provide a new way to study quantum phase transitions as well as LZ transitions.
2964	The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure.
3070	This research paper presents a study on the relationship between the transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant, and energy on locally compact spaces. The main objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of these three quantities under different conditions and to establish their interdependence. The research findings suggest that the transfinite diameter and Chebyshev constant are closely related, with the latter being an upper bound for the former. Additionally, the energy of a locally compact space was found to be directly proportional to the square of the Chebyshev constant. These results have important implications in the field of mathematical analysis and can be used to derive new theorems and formulas for various applications.

Overall, the paper highlights the significant potential for using Chern parity to explore the properties of TIs and opens up new avenues for research in this field.

The study found that the deterministic behavior of stochastic genetic circuits can be predicted based on the topology of the circuit. The results suggest that the proposed approach can be used to design more robust genetic circuits that have predictable behavior. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of understanding the deterministic behavior of stochastic genetic circuits for the development of effective synthetic biology applications.
1069	The estimation of missing input vector elements in real time processing applications requires a system that possesses the knowledge of certain characteristics such as correlations between variables, which are inherent in the input space. Computational intelligence techniques and maximum likelihood techniques do possess such characteristics and as a result are important for imputation of missing data. This paper compares two approaches to the problem of missing data estimation. The first technique is based on the current state of the art approach to this problem, that being the use of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Expectation Maximisation (EM. The second approach is the use of a system based on auto-associative neural networks and the Genetic Algorithm as discussed by Adbella and Marwala3. The estimation ability of both of these techniques is compared, based on three datasets and conclusions are made.
2071	For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner part of the disk is expected to make a transition from advection dominance to neutrino cooling. This transition is characterized by sharp changes of the disk properties. I argue here that during this transition, a modest increase of the accretion rate leads to powerful enhancement of the Poynting luminosity of the GRB flow and decrease of its baryon loading. These changes of the characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon energy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.
449	We present an experimental study of the dynamics underlying the buildup and decay of dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a single semiconductor quantum dot. Our experiment shows that the nuclei can be polarized on a time scale of a few milliseconds, while their decay dynamics depends drastically on external parameters. We show that a single electron can very efficiently depolarize the nuclear spins and discuss two processes that can cause this depolarization. Conversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear spin polarization is on the time scale of a second, most likely limited by the non-secular terms of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. We can further suppress this depolarization rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude by applying an external magnetic field exceeding 1 mT.
2660	We introduce a novel extension of the Gutzwiller variational wavefunction able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we find that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron repulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.
2699	"The research paper titled ""Tiling models for metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants"" investigates the nature and behavior of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants using various tiling models. The study reveals that the metadislocations are composed of a series of topological defects that can be described using specific tiling patterns. It also demonstrates that the tiling models can provide insights into the structural and mechanical properties of the approximants, including the formation of shear bands and the deformation behavior under stress. The essential conclusion is that the tiling models are useful tools for understanding the complex nature of metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants and can aid in the design of new materials with desired properties."
2271	The study of excited states in solids is essential for understanding the electronic and optical properties of materials. Ab initio wavefunction-based methods are powerful tools for calculating excited states in solids, but they often neglect important correlation effects.

A systematic analysis of the correlation effects on the electronic structure of ionic oxides will be performed. The results will provide insights into the nature of electronic excitations in these materials and will pave the way for the design of novel materials with tailored electronic properties.
2996	This research paper explores the dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds, a theoretical construct in which our observable universe is a four-dimensional membrane embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The dynamical Casimir effect refers to the production of particles from vacuum fluctuations in a rapidly changing cavity. This paper investigates the effect on the braneworld scenario and its implications for experimental testing. The main conclusion is that the braneworld model can lead to significant modifications in the dynamical Casimir effect, with potential consequences for the interpretation and detection of this phenomenon. This paper provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing investigation of the nature of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics.
3570	Presented in this paper is the kinematic analysis of a symmetrical three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator. In opposite to serial manipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This property produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility in trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of aspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on the notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse kinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular assembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel manipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle.
2446	New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies.

The authors find that their method produces results that are in excellent agreement with both numerical simulations and experimental data. Furthermore, they demonstrate that their approach can be used to study the behavior of systems with strong interactions, where perturbative methods break down. Ultimately, the paper concludes that non-perturbative conserving approximations offer a powerful tool for understanding the collective behavior of interacting particle systems.
156	"The research paper titled ""Decoherence of Highly Mixed Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions"" discusses the phenomenon of decoherence in macroscopic quantum systems. The paper explores the effect of decoherence on highly mixed macroscopic quantum superpositions and how it leads to the collapse of the quantum state into a classical state. The authors conclude that the decoherence process is irreversible and that the loss of coherence in macroscopic systems is a fundamental limitation of quantum mechanics. The paper highlights the importance of understanding decoherence in macroscopic systems for the development of quantum technologies and the realization of quantum computing. Overall, the paper provides insights into the behavior of macroscopic quantum systems and the challenges faced in harnessing their full potential."
D1-16	General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is a geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It provides a unified description of gravity as a property of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional continuum combining space and time. The theory posits that massive objects cause a curvature in spacetime, and this curvature influences the motion of objects, effectively manifesting as gravity. Einstein developed general relativity to address limitations in Newton's law of universal gravitation, particularly in explaining anomalies like the precession of Mercury's orbit. The theory has been extensively tested and confirmed through observations of gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects, and the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields

880	This research paper investigates the effect of beta-Dystroglycan (beta-DG) processing on Utrophin/DP116 anchorage in normal and MDX mouse Schwann cell membrane. The study found that beta-DG processing significantly affects the localization of Utrophin/DP116 in the Schwann cell membrane, leading to reduced membrane stabilization and increased susceptibility to damage. This suggests that beta-DG processing may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and highlights the potential of Utrophin/DP116 as a therapeutic target for this condition. Overall, these results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and have important implications for the development of novel therapies.
1609	The research paper presents a new chaotic attractor in a multi-strain epidemiological model that incorporates temporary cross-immunity. The model considers the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of a disease in a population and the temporary immunity that arises from exposure to one strain. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate the existence of a chaotic attractor in the model with temporary cross-immunity. The results show that the chaotic behavior can arise due to the interaction between the cross-immunity and the transmission dynamics of the disease. The study concludes that the new chaotic attractor has important implications for understanding the dynamics of multiple strains of a disease and highlights the need for further research in this area.
1001	This paper explores the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in selective-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The authors propose a selective-fading MIMO channel model and derive the DMT for this model using an outage probability analysis. They also compare the performance of different MIMO schemes, including space-time codes and beamforming, in terms of their achievable DMT. The findings suggest that beamforming can achieve higher multiplexing gains than space-time codes, but at the cost of reduced diversity gains. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering the DMT when designing MIMO systems for selective-fading channels.
2379	This research paper explores the formation of vortices through the merging and interference of multiple trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of the condensates and their interactions with each other.

The findings provide insights into the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates in complex systems and may have implications for the development of future quantum technologies.
933	We tailor the shape and phase of the pump pulse spectrum in order to study the coherent lattice dynamics in tellurium. Employing the coherent control via splitting the pump pulse into a two-pulse sequence, we show that the oscillations due to A1 coherent phonons can be cancelled but not enhanced as compared to single pulse excitation. We further demonstrate that a decisive factor for the coherent phonon generation is the bandwidth of the pulse spectrum and not the steepness of the pulse envelope. We also observe that the coherent amplitude for long pump pulses decreases exponentially independent of the shape of the pulse spectrum. Finally, by varying the pulse chirp, we show that the coherent amplitude is independent of while the oscillation lifetime is dependent on the chirp sign.
1776	Recently, one of us (H.S.) gave an explicit form of the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action of QED. We first rederive the identity using a functional method. The identity makes it possible to realize the gauge symmetry even in the presence of a momentum cutoff. In the cutoff dependent realization, the abelian nature of the gauge symmetry is lost, breaking the nilpotency of the BRS transformation. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we extend the Wilson action by including the antifield contributions. Then, the Ward-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action is lifted to a quantum master equation, and the modified BRS transformation regains nilpotency. We also obtain a flow equation for the extended Wilson action.
738	This research paper examines the concept of multiple-event probability in general-relativistic quantum mechanics, and proposes a discrete model as a potential framework for understanding this complex phenomenon. By analyzing the underlying principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, the paper argues that a discrete model may provide a more accurate representation of multiple-event probability than existing continuous models. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the discrete model in predicting the probability of multiple events in complex systems. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and offers a promising avenue for further exploration of multiple-event probability in these fields.
988	This article presents a model of general-purpose computing on a semantic network substrate. The concepts presented are applicable to any semantic network representation. However, due to the standards and technological infrastructure devoted to the Semantic Web effort, this article is presented from this point of view. In the proposed model of computing, the application programming interface, the run-time program, and the state of the computing virtual machine are all represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The implementation of the concepts presented provides a practical computing paradigm that leverages the highly-distributed and standardized representational-layer of the Semantic Web.
159	We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability obtained by optimal schemes.
3178	Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most 1.
3433	Graphene nanoribbons are quasi-one-dimensional meterials with finite width. Characterizing a wide class of nanoribbons by edge shape and width, we make a systematic analysis of their electronic properties. The band gap structure of nanoribbons is shown to exhibit a valley structure with stream-like sequences of metallic or almost metallic nanoribbons. Among them, all zigzag nanoribbons are metallic, and armchair nanoribbons are metallic by period of 3. We find that these stream-like sequences correspond to equi-width curves, and that the band gap of chiral and armchair nanoribbons oscillate as a function of the width. Furthermore a possible application of nanoribbons to nanoelectronics is discussed.
2365	This research paper introduces a new approach to Arakelov geometry, which is a mathematical field that studies the intersection between algebraic geometry and complex analysis. The authors propose a new way of defining Arakelov divisors, which are important objects in this field, using ideas from tropical geometry. They then use this new definition to prove several key results, including a version of the Riemann-Roch theorem that holds for Arakelov divisors. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of this new approach to other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and algebraic geometry. Overall, this research presents a promising new avenue for studying Arakelov geometry and its related fields.
2004	The research paper proposes a joint universal lossy coding and identification scheme for stationary mixing sources. The main theme of the paper is to develop a method that can efficiently compress and identify mixed sources without prior knowledge of the mixing process. The proposed method is based on a combination of universal lossy coding and maximum likelihood estimation. The paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of compression rate and identification accuracy. The noteworthy conclusion of the paper is that the joint universal lossy coding and identification scheme provides a promising approach for compressing and identifying mixed sources in various applications, such as signal processing and data compression.
1217	This work presents an extended formulation of maximal stiffness design, within the framework of the topology optimization. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation behind the strut-and-tie modeling. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with the help of two examples.
2191	This research paper explores the concepts of charge conservation and the equivalence principle in the noncommutative spacetime framework. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the effects of noncommutativity on these fundamental principles of physics. The paper presents theoretical derivations and calculations to demonstrate that the noncommutativity of spacetime can lead to violations of charge conservation and the equivalence principle. The findings of the study suggest that the noncommutativity of spacetime could have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further research to fully understand the consequences of noncommutativity on the principles of charge conservation and the equivalence principle.
1668	This research paper explores the relationship between Whitehead's Trilogy and the curvature of spacetime. The paper argues that Whitehead's philosophical framework provides a useful lens through which to understand the nature of spacetime, particularly in relation to the curvature of space caused by the presence of mass and energy. Drawing on Whitehead's concepts of actual entities, prehensions, and concrescence, the paper develops a new model for understanding the curvature of spacetime that is grounded in a relational ontology. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this new model for our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and the implications for future research in physics and philosophy.
763	We elaborate an unified geometric approach to classical mechanics, Riemann-Finsler spaces and gravity theories on Lie algebroids provided with nonlinear connection (N-connection) structure. There are investigated the conditions when the fundamental geometric objects like the anchor, metric and linear connection, almost sympletic and related almost complex structures may be canonically defined by a N-connection induced from a regular Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian), in mechanical models, or by generic off-diagonal metric terms and nonholonomic frames, in gravity theories. Such geometric constructions are modelled on nonholonomic manifolds provided with nonintegrable distributions and related chains of exact sequences of submanifolds defining N-connections. We investigate the main properties of the Lagrange, Hamilton, Finsler-Riemann and Einstein-Cartan algebroids and construct and analyze exact solutions describing such objects.

The authors present the mathematical model of the manipulator and derive its kinematic equations, which are used to analyze its motion characteristics. They also propose a novel approach for optimizing the manipulator's workspace using a genetic algorithm. The results of the study show that the proposed manipulator has a large workspace and good motion performance, making it suitable for various applications in industry and automation. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid manipulators.
3296	The aim of this research paper is to investigate the bond formation and slow heterogeneous dynamics in adhesive spheres with long-ranged repulsion. We present a quantitative test of Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) to understand the dynamic behavior of these systems. Our results demonstrate that MCT is capable of predicting the slow dynamics observed in these systems, particularly the dynamics of bond formation and the formation of glassy structures. Moreover, our findings indicate that the long-range repulsion significantly affects the dynamics, leading to a more complex behavior. Our study provides insights into the fundamental understanding of the dynamic behavior of adhesive spheres and highlights the importance of considering long-range interactions in predicting their behavior.

The central focus is on the identification and characterization of these states, which are important for understanding the behavior of quantum fields in cosmological settings. The key findings include the existence of a unique vacuum state that is invariant under the symmetries of the spacetime, as well as the construction of coherent states that provide a semiclassical description of the quantum field. These results have implications for the study of early universe cosmology and the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetimes.
2468	This research paper explores the concept of lattice refining loop quantum cosmology in the context of anisotropic models and stability. Loop quantum cosmology is a theoretical framework that seeks to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity to better understand the behavior of the universe on a cosmological scale. The lattice refining technique is used to increase the resolution of the lattice used in numerical simulations of loop quantum cosmology, allowing for more accurate and precise calculations. Anisotropic models are introduced to better account for the non-uniformity of the universe. The stability of these models is analyzed, and it is found that lattice refining can improve the stability of the system. The results of this study have potential implications for the understanding of the early universe and the development of more accurate cosmological models.
2935	"The research paper titled ""Monitoring spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a drying colloidal thin film"" presents a study on the drying process of a colloidal thin film and its spatially heterogeneous dynamics. The main subject of the study is the understanding of the drying process of colloidal thin films and the dynamics that occur during the process. The researchers used an advanced imaging technique to monitor the drying process and mapped the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that occur during the process. The essential findings of the study suggest that the drying process of colloidal thin films is highly dynamic and spatially heterogeneous. The researchers conclude that their study provides new insights into the drying process of colloidal thin films and offers a novel approach to studying spatially heterogeneous dynamics in other materials."
3291	"We consider the formation of OB associations from two perspectives: (a) the fractional gas consumption in star formation,epsilon, per dynamical time scale t_dyn in a galaxy, and (b) the origin of the so-called Kennicutt-Schmidt law that the rate of star formation per unit area is proportional to a power, alpha, of the surface density in HI and H_2 gas when certain thresholds are crossed. The empirical findings that epsilon is approximately 0.01 and alpha is approximately 1.4 or 1.5 have simple explanations if the rate of star formation is magnetically regulated. An empirical test of the ideas resides in an analysis of why giant OB associations are ``strung out like pearls along the arms"" of spiral galaxies."
2823	This research paper presents a study of the proper motion of L and T dwarf stars within the Pleiades star cluster. By using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the authors identified 21 L and T dwarf candidates as potential members of the Pleiades. Through further analysis of their proper motions and comparison with known members of the cluster, they confirmed 10 of these candidates as likely members. This study expands our understanding of the population of low-mass stars within the Pleiades and highlights the potential of using proper motion as a tool for identifying new cluster members.

The ASIC scheme has been previously shown to improve the accuracy of exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory calculations. The study focused on the analysis of the exchange parameters for atomic systems with varying electron configurations. The main findings of this research paper suggest that the ASIC method significantly improves the accuracy of the exchange parameters compared to standard exchange-correlation functionals. The results highlight the potential of ASIC as a useful tool for predicting electronic properties of materials and provide insights for future development of more accurate exchange-correlation functionals.
394	Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex. This paper explores an imputation technique based on rough set computations. In this paper, characteristic relations are introduced to describe incompletely specified decision tables.It is shown that the basic rough set idea of lower and upper approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99%.
D2-5	There were observations of spectral lines. That means there are distinct levels where electrons stay. Classical mechanics does not allow such distinctive levels for electrons to stay. For this new approach is needed. In classical mechanics, energy remains constant. This must be building block. It is my interpretation. Then. he thought that the electrons obey some function distribution which give distinctive levels. This is possible for sin and cos functions. So the electrons should obey sin and cos functions and also obey total energy conservation i.e to start with kinetic energy + potential energy = constant. Potential energy and sin function is not problem, because we know pendulum oscillations. How to modify kinetic energy to give sine function.
1068	"The research paper titled ""Towards observable signatures of other bubble universes"" explores the possibility of detecting other universes beyond our own. The paper argues that if our universe is just one of many bubbles in a larger multiverse, there should be some observable consequences that could be detected. The authors propose several possible methods for detecting these signatures, including looking for variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation and searching for evidence of collisions between our universe and others. The paper concludes that while detecting other universes is a challenging task, the search for observable signatures is an important direction for future research in cosmology."
1981	The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junctions (npn or pnp) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.
2552	Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta. However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.
1743	This research paper investigates the optical pumping of charged excitons in unintentionally doped InAs quantum dots. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the effect of optical pumping on the charged exciton states and their dynamics in these quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that optical pumping can efficiently modify the charged exciton states and their recombination dynamics. The study also explores the potential applications of this phenomenon in the development of quantum dot-based optoelectronic devices. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of charged excitons in InAs quantum dots and offer new avenues for the design and optimization of quantum dot-based devices.
1718	Feedback from black hole activity is widely believed to play a key role in regulating star formation and black hole growth. A long-standing issue is the relation between the star formation and fueling the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation rates in circumnuclear regions (CNRs). Comparing with the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law, we find that the star formation rates in CNRs of most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to explain the suppressed star formation rates.
D2-25	"Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, both essential to our understanding of strong nuclear forces, yet they differ in several key ways. Fundamental Nature Quarks are elementary fermions that serve as the building blocks of hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other composite particles). Six ""flavors"" exist: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. In contrast, gluons are gauge bosons that mediate the strong force between quarks, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. Properties Quarks possess fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3), mass, spin-1/2, and color charge. Gluons are massless, have spin-1, carry no electric charge, but uniquely possess both color and anticolor charges."
D2-51	"The Big Bang theory is the predominant scientific explanation for our universe's origin, describing not an explosion but rather how the universe expanded from an initial state of extreme density and temperature approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial state, called a singularity, contained all matter in an incredibly hot, dense point before expansion began. Proposed by physicist Georges Lemaître in 1927, the theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (essentially the Big Bang's ""afterglow"") and the abundance of light elements in the universe. Later refinements include cosmic inflation theory, suggesting that the early universe briefly expanded faster than light speed."
320	This research paper focuses on SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2, a white dwarf star with a gaseous debris disc. The main objective of the study was to analyze the properties of the disc and understand its formation. The authors used various observational techniques, including spectroscopy and imaging, to study the system. The crucial finding of the study was the detection of a second white dwarf with a gaseous debris disc, which suggests that such systems may be more common than previously thought. The study also provides insight into the evolution of planetary systems and the fate of their debris after the star dies.
3434	The paper investigates the band gap structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are strips of graphene with varying widths and edge shapes. Using density functional theory calculations, the authors demonstrate that the band gap of GNRs is highly dependent on their width and edge shape. Specifically, GNRs with zigzag edges have a band gap that decreases with increasing width, while those with armchair edges have a constant band gap regardless of width. The authors also show that the band gap of GNRs can be tuned by introducing defects or functional groups. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of GNR-based electronic devices.
490	The research paper presents a model of late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) that simulates memory maintenance. The model focuses on the role of protein synthesis in the maintenance of L-LTP and how it can be disrupted by inhibitors. The simulation results suggest that protein synthesis is a critical factor in memory maintenance. The study also highlights the importance of L-LTP in the formation of long-term memory and provides insight into potential therapeutic targets for memory disorders. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of memory and the potential for developing effective treatments for memory-related disorders.

2076	"The motivations to make ultraviolet (UV) studies of supernovae (SNe) are reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for ""dark energy"" that seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed."
1214	The research paper proposes a new approach to Gaussian layered broadcast coding with successive refinement that aims to minimize expected distortion. The approach involves creating a layered structure with multiple encoding layers, where each layer provides additional refinement to the previously encoded layers. The authors derive an expression for the minimum expected distortion achievable using this approach and show that it is achievable through a practical coding scheme. The proposed approach is compared with existing methods, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms them in terms of expected distortion. The main conclusion of the paper is that the proposed approach provides an effective method for achieving high-quality broadcast coding with successive refinement.
3593	The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a crucial tool for understanding the origins and evolution of the universe. Recent studies have shown that the CMB can also provide valuable information about the outer solar system. This research paper explores how the CMB can reveal the properties of distant objects such as Kuiper Belt Objects and the Oort Cloud. We examine the ways in which the CMB can be used to study the composition, size, and shape of these bodies. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the outer solar system. Our analysis suggests that the CMB is a powerful tool for investigating the outer reaches of our solar system and can provide valuable insights into the history of our cosmic neighborhood.
D2-65	Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term.
1112	With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator must perform manually. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for some years. However, little research has been achieved. The aim of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent itemsets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.
792	This research paper explores the E_6/U(1)_N model and its implications for neutrino mass and dark matter. The authors use a two-loop calculation to determine the neutrino mass, finding that it is sensitive to the choice of parameters in the model. They also investigate the possibility of dark matter particles in the model, considering both a scalar and a fermionic candidate. The authors find that the scalar candidate is ruled out by current experimental limits, but the fermionic candidate remains a viable option. Overall, this research highlights the potential of the E_6/U(1)_N model in explaining both neutrino mass and dark matter, and provides insights into the properties of such particles.

1683	This research paper presents hydrodynamical simulations of the jet in the symbiotic star MWC 560 III, with a focus on understanding X-ray jets in symbiotic stars. The simulations reveal that the jet is highly collimated and has a strong shock structure, which is consistent with observations of similar systems.

The main theme of the paper is to explore the impact of spin on the dynamics of QCD strings and its role in the formation of hadrons. The paper employs both analytical and numerical techniques to study the behavior of the spin-string interaction. The study reveals that the spin of quarks affects the shape of the QCD string and can lead to the formation of mesons with non-zero spin. The paper concludes that the spin-string interaction plays a crucial role in the formation of hadrons and sheds new light on the understanding of QCD strings and their properties."
959	This research paper focuses on the direct optimization of ranking measures, which are widely used in information retrieval and machine learning applications. The paper proposes a new optimization framework that directly optimizes ranking measures, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, without the need for surrogate loss functions. The proposed method is based on a novel gradient descent algorithm that updates the ranking model parameters in a way that directly improves the ranking measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets for information retrieval and machine learning tasks. These results suggest that the proposed method can provide a more effective and efficient approach to optimizing ranking measures in various applications.
3115	"A parametric study of so-called ""super growth"" of single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminum oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs. Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates."
2558	We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the Planck length.
3952	A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
3568	Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators. One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.
D2-80	A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a sophisticated medical imaging technique that reveals how tissues and organs function at the molecular level. Unlike CT or MRI scans that show anatomical structure, PET scans detect metabolic activity by using a radioactive tracer—typically a form of glucose—injected into the bloodstream. This tracer emits positrons that create signals detected by the scanner. Areas with higher metabolic activity, such as rapidly growing cancer cells, absorb more tracer and appear brighter on the resulting 3D images. PET scans are particularly valuable for diagnosing and monitoring cancer, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular conditions. The procedure is painless, typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours, and exposes patients to minimal radiation.
3134	"The research paper titled ""GLAST and Dark Matter Substructure in the Milky Way"" explores the potential of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) to detect dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. The study utilizes simulations to investigate the expected gamma-ray signals from dark matter subhalos and streams. The results suggest that GLAST could detect a significant number of dark matter subhalos and streams, aiding in the search for the elusive particle responsible for dark matter. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the substructure of dark matter in the Milky Way for future studies of galactic structure and evolution."
3537	Protein folding is a complex process that is critical for the proper functioning of biological systems. Understanding the network structure of protein folding pathways can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying this process. In this paper, we review recent advances in the field of protein folding and explore the network structure of folding pathways. We examine the role of network motifs, community structure, and other network properties in shaping folding pathways. Additionally, we discuss the implications of network structure for protein design and engineering, as well as potential applications in drug discovery. Our findings suggest that a network-based approach can provide a powerful framework for understanding protein folding and its role in biological systems.
2273	This research paper focuses on understanding the abundance patterns in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that are undergoing third dredge-up (TDU) and hot-bottom burning (HBB). We utilize a sample of AGB stars with masses ranging from 4 to 6 solar masses and perform spectroscopic observations to determine their chemical abundances. Our analysis reveals significant enhancements of carbon, nitrogen, and s-process elements in stars undergoing TDU, which is consistent with previous theoretical predictions. Additionally, we find evidence for HBB in some stars, indicated by enhanced abundances of lithium and beryllium. Our results suggest that the interplay between TDU and HBB plays a crucial role in shaping the chemical evolution of intermediate-mass AGB stars, and has important implications for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the universe.
976	The charge transport mechanism and the macroscopic dielectric constant in polycrystalline device materials commonly exhibit several components such as electrode-sample interface, grain boundary and bulk contributions. In order to gain precise understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic device materials it is essential to deconvolute these contributions. The paradigm of functional thermistor ceramics based on thick film spinel manganates has been studied by temperature dependent alternating current impedance spectroscopy. Three typical relaxation phenomena were detected, which all showed a separated temperature dependence of resistivity consistent with thermally activated charge transport. The dominating grain boundary and the interface contributions exhibited distinctively different capacitance allowing clear identification. The composite nature of the dielectric properties in polycrystalline functional ceramics was emphasized, and impedance spectroscopy was shown to be a powerful tool to account for and model such behaviour.
767	Resent works of Hawking and Susskind suggested that information is conserved in the universe. We extend this thesis and propose that dynamics of information - computations can conserve in Anti-de-Sitter cosmological model. Information geometry formalism is proposed to analyze information in dynamical systems. We consider entropy flow as a geometrical flow on statistical manifold and develop a Dynamic Cores model to analyze migration of information in dynamical systems. Geometrical flow on the statistical manifold was considered as a transition of local dynamical systems in original d+1-dim AdS space to their delocalized holographic representation in d-dim Conformal Field Theory (CFT). It was noted that geometrical flow related to renormalization group flow and provide semi-conservation of informational invariants. Those invariants interpreted as types of computations.
3628	An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the data, and hence, saves time.
815	The unbinding process of a protein-ligand complex of major biological interest was investigated by means of a computational approach at atomistic classical mechanical level. An energy minimisation-based technique was used to determine the dissociation paths of the system by probing only a relevant set of generalized coordinates. The complex problem was reduced to a low-dimensional scanning along a selected distance between the protein and the ligand. Orientational coordinates of the escaping fragment (the ligand) were also assessed in order to further characterise the unbinding. Solvent effects were accounted for by means of the Poisson--Boltzmann continuum model. The corresponding dissociation time was derived from the calculated barrier height, in compliance with the experimentally reported Arrhenius-like behaviour. The computed results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.
3090	In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with the zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass of the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge couplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial deviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are suppressed by a factor \cos \theta_H from the values in the standard model, where \theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can be tested at LHC and ILC.
1300	This research paper explores the physics of polarons in optical lattices. A polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between a moving charged particle and its surrounding medium. Optical lattices are periodic structures created by interfering laser beams, which trap and manipulate atoms to form a lattice-like structure. By combining these two systems, we can investigate the behavior of polarons in a controlled environment. In this paper, we review the theoretical background of polarons and optical lattices, and discuss recent experimental observations of polarons in optical lattices. We also explore the potential applications of these systems in quantum computing and quantum simulation. Overall, this paper highlights the exciting possibilities for studying and manipulating polarons in optical lattices and sheds light on the fundamental physics underlying these systems.
4024	This research paper focuses on modeling the X-ray continuum of black hole candidates in accretion disks. The primary theme of the study is to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for producing the observed X-ray emission from these objects. The researchers used a Monte Carlo simulation to model the X-ray continuum and found that the emission is primarily due to Compton scattering off electrons in the disk. The study also shows that the disk geometry and the black hole spin play significant roles in shaping the X-ray spectrum. The findings highlight the importance of accurate modeling of the accretion disk and the black hole properties for understanding the X-ray emission of black hole candidates.
3233	We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates 0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously difficult to achieve.
4031	We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.
396	The Tracy-Widom distribution functions involve integrals of a Painlev\'e II function starting from positive infinity. In this paper, we express the Tracy-Widom distribution functions in terms of integrals starting from minus infinity. There are two consequences of these new representations. The first is the evaluation of the total integral of the Hastings-McLeod solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. The second is the evaluation of the constant term of the asymptotic expansions of the Tracy-Widom distribution functions as the distribution parameter approaches minus infinity. For the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution function, this gives an alternative proof of the recent work of Deift, Its, and Krasovsky. The constant terms for the GOE and GSE Tracy-Widom distribution functions are new.
2837	Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.
607	This research paper investigates the impact of emission lines on UBVR photometry in astronomical observations. The study uses a combination of simulations and observations to understand the effects of emission lines on photometric measurements. The results indicate that emission lines can significantly affect photometric measurements, leading to errors in the determination of the intrinsic properties of astronomical objects. The research provides important insights into the factors that must be considered when analyzing photometric data and highlights the need for careful calibration and correction of data. Ultimately, this study contributes to our understanding of the complexities of astronomical observations and provides valuable information for future research in this field.
3560	The period map for cubic fourfolds takes values in a locally symmetric variety of orthogonal type of dimension 20. We determine the image of this period map (thus confirming a conjecture of Hassett) and give at the same time a new proof of the theorem of Voisin that asserts that this period map is an open embedding. An algebraic version of our main result is an identification of the algebra of SL(6)-invariant polynomials on the space of cubic forms in 6 complex variables with a certain algebra of meromorphic automorphic forms on a symmetric domain of orthogonal type of dimension 20. We also describe the stratification of the moduli space of semistable cubic fourfolds in terms of a Dynkin-Vinberg diagram.
2309	This research paper investigates the formation of Ramsey fringes during the excitation of topological modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main objective of this study is to understand the behavior of topological modes in a condensate and how they can be manipulated to create Ramsey fringes. The study finds that the formation of Ramsey fringes is highly sensitive to the excitation frequency and the strength of the external perturbation. Additionally, the study shows that the topological modes can be used as a useful tool for precision measurements and quantum information processing. The results of this study have important implications for the development of quantum technologies and the understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics.
393	This research paper examines the fundamental parameters of He-weak and He-strong stars, with a focus on their chemical composition, evolution, and observational characteristics. The study uses a combination of theoretical models and observational data to investigate the physical properties of these stars, including their mass, radius, luminosity, and surface temperature. The analysis reveals important differences between He-weak and He-strong stars, including variations in their hydrogen and helium abundance, as well as differences in their evolutionary paths. The research also highlights the relevance of these parameters for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the Universe as a whole. Overall, the study sheds new light on the complex interplay between stellar physics, chemistry, and cosmology.
219	"The research paper titled ""Non-Abelian Discrete Flavor Symmetries"" explores the concept of non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries in particle physics. The paper discusses how these symmetries can be used to explain the observed patterns in the masses and mixing angles of elementary particles, such as neutrinos. The authors also demonstrate how non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries can be incorporated into theoretical models to predict the behavior of particles and interactions. The paper concludes that the use of non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries in particle physics has the potential to provide new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe."
3435	We study the constraints imposed by the Hadamard condition on the two-point function of local states of a scalar quantum field conformally coupled to a gravitational background. We propose a method to assign a stress tensor to the state-dependent part of the two point function which arises as a conserved tensor with an anomalous trace. To characterize the local Hadamard states of physical interest we apply a super-selection rule relating this quantum stress tensor to the matter stress tensor of a conformal invariant gravitational model subject to a conformal symmetry breaking term. This implies that the determination of a Hadamard state may be considered as an integral part of its gravitational coupling via the back-reaction effect.
1415	We study the evolution of the universe which contains a multiple number of non-relativistic scalar fields decaying into both radiation and pressureless matter. We present a powerful analytic formalism to calculate the matter and radiation curvature perturbations, and find that our analytic estimates agree with full numerical results within an error of less than one percent. Also we discuss the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation components, which may be detected by near future cosmological observations, and point out that it crucially depends on the branching ratio of the decay rate of the scalar fields and that it is hard to make any model independent predictions.
3050	"In this topical review I revisit the ""chromospheric flare."" This should currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone, but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents several difficult and interesting physical problems."
2241	This research paper presents an achievable rate region for interference channels with conferencing, which is a communication network where multiple transmitters and receivers exchange information over a shared channel. The primary theme of this paper is to investigate how conferencing can improve the communication performance in interference channels. The paper proposes a new coding scheme that enables the transmitters to exchange messages through a common message-passing protocol, which results in an achievable rate region that outperforms the existing schemes. The essential finding of this research is that conferencing can significantly enhance the capacity of interference channels, and the proposed coding scheme achieves this improvement. The paper concludes that conferencing can be a useful technique in designing efficient communication systems for interference channels.
3364	"The research paper titled ""On Certain Quantization Aspects of (Generalized) Toda Systems"" explores the quantum aspects of Toda systems and their generalizations. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the quantization of Toda systems and the relationship between classical and quantum integrability. The indispensable findings of the research are the discovery of new quantum integrable structures related to Toda systems, the quantization of Toda lattices, and the identification of quantum Toda systems as natural quantum deformations of classical Toda systems. The paper concludes that the study of quantization aspects of Toda systems could provide new insights into the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and their relationship to classical mechanics."
42	This paper investigates particle motion in the rotating black ring metric, a solution to the equations of General Relativity describing a five-dimensional black hole with a ring topology around its event horizon. The authors derive the equations of motion for test particles moving in this metric and analyze their behavior in various regimes, including geodesic motion, circular orbits, and chaotic trajectories. They find that the black ring metric exhibits several interesting features, such as the existence of stable circular orbits in the plane of rotation and the appearance of chaotic behavior for particles with nonzero angular momentum. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of black hole spacetimes and may have implications for astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disks and binary black hole mergers.
2310	The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.
3844	This research paper investigates the superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model and analyzes the effects of vertex and non-local corrections. The main objective is to understand how these corrections impact the superconducting behavior of the system. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, the study shows that the vertex and non-local corrections can significantly alter the superconducting properties of the system. The key results suggest that the vertex correction enhances the critical temperature while the non-local correction suppresses it. Additionally, the study reveals that the non-local correction can induce a reentrant behavior of the superconducting phase. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the superconducting properties of the quasi-2D Holstein model and highlights the importance of considering vertex and non-local corrections in future studies of this system.
2259	"The research paper titled ""Path Distinguishability in Double Scattering of Light by Atoms"" explores the phenomenon of double scattering of light by atoms and the ability to distinguish between the possible paths of the scattered photons. The study uses a theoretical model to analyze the interference patterns of the scattered photons and their relationship to the path distinguishability. The main finding of the research is that the degree of distinguishability between the paths depends on the scattering angle and the polarization of the incident light. The research concludes that the path distinguishability in double scattering can be controlled by adjusting the incident light and atomic parameters, which has implications for quantum information processing and communication."
1855	Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.) has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry of interaction model (context semantics).
1943	This research paper focuses on the development of a new mathematical tool called the dual Feynman transform for modular operads. The main aim of this study is to provide a rigorous framework for the study of modular operads, which are algebraic structures that describe symmetries in mathematical objects. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the dual Feynman transform, its properties, and its applications in the context of modular operads. The crucial finding of this research is that the dual Feynman transform is a powerful tool for studying modular operads, and it allows for the computation of important quantities such as quantum invariants. The paper concludes by discussing the potential future directions of research in this area, and the impact of the dual Feynman transform on the broader field of algebraic geometry and topology.
925	"The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on the concept of ""sensory substitution"" or ""perceptual supplementation"", we are developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults."
1443	This research paper explores the superconducting state of an excitonic insulator, a material that exhibits both excitonic and superconducting properties. The central focus of the study is to understand the relationship between the excitonic and superconducting properties and the conditions required for the excitonic insulator to become a superconductor. The paper presents theoretical models and experimental evidence to support the existence of a superconducting state in the excitonic insulator, and proposes potential applications for this material in quantum computing and energy storage. The study concludes that the excitonic insulator is a promising candidate for developing new superconducting materials with unique properties.
2245	This research paper presents a simulation study of graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors (GNRFETs) using a numerical device simulator. GNRFETs are a promising technology for building high-performance electronic devices due to their unique electronic properties. In this study, we investigate the performance of GNRFETs by analyzing the device characteristics such as the current-voltage (I-V) curves, the transconductance (gm), and the subthreshold swing (SS). We explore the impact of various parameters such as the channel length, the width, and the gate voltage on the device performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that the GNRFETs exhibit superior performance compared to conventional silicon-based field effect transistors. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of GNRFETs for future device applications.
2690	We generalize the rotationally-invariant formulation of the slave-boson formalism to multiorbital models, with arbitrary interactions, crystal fields, and multiplet structure. This allows for the study of multiplet effects on the nature of low-energy quasiparticles. Non-diagonal components of the matrix of quasiparticle weights can be calculated within this framework. When combined with cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us to address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the superexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We illustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two coupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a two-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).
3687	This research paper aims to investigate the phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics. Gaussian-core models are commonly used in the study of liquid crystals and exhibit a unique range of behavior compared to typical hard sphere models. The paper utilizes computer simulations to examine the phase behavior of Gaussian-core nematics as a function of temperature and density. The results of the simulations demonstrate the existence of multiple phases, including nematic and smectic phases, and provide insight into the structural and dynamic properties of the system. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the behavior of Gaussian-core nematics and have important implications for the design and development of new liquid crystal materials.
2366	The application of Superheated Droplet Detectors (SDDs) to dark matter searches has so far been confined to the light nuclei refrigerants C2ClF5 and C4F10 (SIMPLE and PICASSO, respectively), with a principle sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions. Given the competitive results of these devices, as a result of their intrinsic insensitivity to backgrounds, we have developed a prototype trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I)-loaded SDD with increased sensitivity to spin-independent interactions as well. A low (0.102 kgd) exposure test operation of two high concentration, 1 liter devices is described, and the results compared with leading experiments in both spin-dependent and -independent sectors. Although competitive in both sectors when the difference in exposures is accounted for, a problem with fracturing of the detector gel must be addressed before significantly larger exposures can be envisioned.
346	We have performed spatially resolved Polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Microscopy measurements on as-grown and annealed Ga0.95Mn0.05As thin films with tensile strain. We find that the films exhibit very strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is increased upon annealing. During magnetic reversal, the domain walls propagate along the direction of surface ripples for the as-grown sample at low temperatures and along the [110] direction for the annealed sample. This indicates that the magnetic domain pattern during reversal is determined by a combination of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a distribution of pinning sites along the surface ripples that can be altered by annealing. These mechanisms could lead to an effective method of controlling domain wall propagation.
3204	"""Cool Stars in Hot Places"" is a research paper that explores the behavior of cool stars in hot environments, specifically in the atmospheres of exoplanets. The paper investigates the effects of high-energy radiation on the magnetic fields and activity of cool stars, and also examines the possibility of detecting these stars using transit observations. The findings suggest that cool stars may play a significant role in the habitability of exoplanets and could potentially be used as indicators of habitable conditions. The paper concludes that further research in this area is necessary to fully understand the complex interactions between cool stars and their environments."""
3091	Gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) is a theoretical framework that proposes the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions in a higher dimensional space. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are two experimental facilities that can test GHU predictions and shed light on the nature of the Higgs boson and the origin of mass. In this research paper, we review recent developments in GHU and discuss their implications for LHC and ILC searches, including the possibility of discovering new particles and interactions. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of GHU and the importance of precision measurements to distinguish between different scenarios. Our analysis suggests that GHU can provide a compelling explanation for the hierarchy problem and offer new avenues for exploring the fundamental nature of the universe.
3813	We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.
3286	This research paper aims at understanding the fragility in supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures by investigating the locally preferred structures. The study uses molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structural and dynamical properties of the mixtures. The results show that the mixtures exhibit fragility, which is attributed to the formation of locally preferred structures that impede the mobility of the molecules. The study also reveals that the fragility is strongly correlated with the degree of structural ordering and the size of the locally preferred structures. These findings provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fragility in supercooled mixtures, with potential applications in materials science and industrial processes.
3455	The electromagnetic field inside a cubic cavity filled up with a linear magnetodielectric medium and in the presence of external charges is quantized by modelling the magnetodielectric medium with two independent quantum fields. Electric and magnetic polarization densities of the medium are defined in terms of the ladder operators of the medium and eigenmodes of the cavity. Maxwell and constitutive equations of the medium together with the equation of motion of the charged particles have been obtained from the Heisenberg equations using a minimal coupling scheme. Spontaneous emission of a two level atom embedded in a magnetodielectric medium is calculated in terms of electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium and the Green function of the cubic cavity as an application of the model.
2943	Photon splitting is a phenomenon that occurs in the presence of a strong laser field. In this process, a single photon is split into two photons with lower energies. The study of this process is of great interest in the field of quantum optics and has potential applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we investigate the conditions required for photon splitting to occur and the resulting properties of the split photons. We also discuss the potential applications of this process in the development of quantum technologies. Our findings suggest that photon splitting may be a promising avenue for the creation of entangled photon pairs and the generation of non-classical states of light.
2612	The use of microfluidic chips has become increasingly popular in various applications due to their small size and ability to manipulate fluids at the microscale level. In this study, we investigate the acoustic resonances that occur within microfluidic chips and their effects on fluid flow using full-image micro-PIV experiments and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that acoustic resonances can significantly alter the flow patterns in microfluidic chips, leading to the development of new flow structures and enhancing mixing efficiency. Furthermore, we show that numerical simulations can accurately predict the acoustic resonance frequencies and associated flow patterns. Overall, our findings provide insights into the fundamental understanding of acoustic resonances in microfluidic chips and their potential applications in enhancing fluid manipulation and mixing.
3625	It has long been known that once you cross the event horizon of a black hole, your destiny lies at the central singularity, irrespective of what you do. Furthermore, your demise will occur in a finite amount of proper time. In this paper, the use of rockets in extending the amount of time before the collision with the central singularity is examined. In general, the use of such rockets can increase your remaining time, but only up to a maximum value; this is at odds with the ``more you struggle, the less time you have'' statement that is sometimes discussed in relation to black holes. The derived equations are simple to solve numerically and the framework can be employed as a teaching tool for general relativity.
1594	The paper describes the potential applications of wavelet analysis on the sphere in the field of cosmology. The authors explain that wavelet analysis can be used to study the distribution of matter and radiation in the universe, as well as the properties of the cosmic microwave background. They also discuss how wavelet analysis can be used to study the large-scale structure of the universe, including the detection of galaxy clusters and the measurement of their masses. The authors conclude that wavelet analysis on the sphere has great potential for advancing our understanding of the universe and its evolution. Noteworthy outcomes include the identification of new galaxy clusters and the potential for more accurate measurements of their masses.
1809	The focus of the study is on shear zones in granular media, which are areas where the material experiences significant deformation due to shear forces. The authors employed 3D Contact Dynamics simulation to investigate the behavior of granular media under different loading conditions. They found that the formation and evolution of shear zones are strongly influenced by the material properties and loading conditions. The study also highlights the importance of considering the particle-scale interactions in understanding the macroscopic behavior of granular media. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanics of granular media and can have implications for various engineering applications, such as geotechnical and civil engineering.
3042	This research paper explores the jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the accretion and ejection processes in these systems. Using numerical simulations and theoretical models, the study investigates the impact of jet interactions on the X-ray emission and variability. The results reveal that the presence of jets can significantly affect the accretion flow and produce strong X-ray variability. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the jet properties, such as speed and orientation, play a crucial role in determining the X-ray emission characteristics. Overall, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between the accretion and jet processes in massive X-ray binaries and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical efforts to fully understand these systems.
1285	The diagram algebra introduced by Brauer that describes the centralizer algebra on tensor products of the natural representation of an orthogonal group has a presentation by generators and relations that only depends on the graph of type An on n nodes. Here we describe an algebra depending on an arbitrary graph of type M. We study its structure when the type is An, Dn, E6, E7, E8. We determine the representations and find the dimensions. The algebra is generically semisimple and contains the group algebra of the Coxeter type M as a subalgebra. It is a ring homomorphism of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of these types. This fact will be used in later work determining the structure of Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras of simply laced spherical type.
1968	The dual observation of the Omega production in central Au+Au collisions having both an exponential p_T distribution and also associated particles above the background has been referred to as the Omega puzzle. We give a quantitative description of how that puzzle can be understood in terms of phantom jets, where only ridges without peaks are produced to give rise to both the Omega trigger and its associated particles. In the framework of recombination of thermal partons we are able to reproduce both the \Delta\phi distribution and the trigger-momentum dependence of the yield of the associated particles. We make predictions on other observables that can be checked by further analyses of the data.
1898	The electronic structure of the quasi-lowdimensional vanadium sulfide \bavs3 is investigated for the different phases above the magnetic ordering temperature. By means of density functional theory and its combination with dynamical-mean field theory, we follow the evolution of the relevant low-energy electronic states on cooling. Hence we go in the metallic regime from the room temperature hexagonal phase to the orthorhombic phase after the first structural transition, and close with the monoclinic insulating phase below the metal-insulator transition. Due to the low symmetry and expected intersite correlations, the latter phase is treated within cellular dynamical mean-field theory. It is generally discussed how the intriguing interplay between band-structure and strong-correlation effects leads to the stabilization of the various electronic phases with decreasing temperature.
3589	This research paper explores the current landscape of supercritical string theory, a theoretical framework that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Through a thorough review of literature and analysis of recent developments in the field, we provide an overview of the key concepts and mathematical structures that underpin supercritical string theory. We also examine the challenges and open questions facing researchers in this area, including the role of supersymmetry, the nature of extra dimensions, and the relationship between string theory and other branches of physics. Our analysis sheds light on the current state of the field and provides a roadmap for future research in this exciting and rapidly evolving area of theoretical physics.
1830	"We present Very Large Array observations at 7 millimeters wavelength that resolve the dust emission structure in the disk around the young star TW Hydrae at the scale of the ~4 AU (~0.16"") radius inner hole inferred from spectral energy distribution modeling. These high resolution data confirm directly the presence of an inner hole in the dust disk and reveal a high brightness ring that we associate with the directly illuminated inner edge of the disk. The clearing of the inner disk plausibly results from the dynamical effects of a giant planet in formation. In an appendix, we develop an analytical framework for the interpretation of visibility curves from power-law disk models with inner holes."
785	We analyse the static solutions of attractive Bose-Einstein condensates under transverse confinement, both with and without axial confinement. By full numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and variational methods we map out the condensate solutions, their energetic properties, and their critical points for instability. With no axial confinement a bright solitary wave solution will tend to decay by dispersion unless the interaction energy is close to the critical value for collapse. In contrast, with axial confinement the only decay mechanism is collapse. The stability of a bright solitary wave solution increases with higher radial confinement. Finally we consider the stability of dynamical states containing up to four solitons and find good agreement with recent experiments.
2604	The study focuses on the SW Sex-type nova-like BH Lyncis in its high state using photometry techniques. The main objective is to investigate the nature and behavior of this star system during its high state. The study found that the light curve of BH Lyncis shows a distinct double-wave modulation with a period of 0.062 days and an amplitude of 0.193 mag. The authors also observed significant variability in the system's brightness during the observation period and suggest that the variability may be caused by mass transfer between the two stars in the system. Overall, the study provides insight into the behavior of SW Sex-type nova-like systems and the mechanisms driving their variability.
327	We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this test are presented.
3727	"Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs).

497	Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Z-contrast imaging we have demonstrated elongated nanostructure formation of fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) within an organic host through annealing. The annealing provides an enhanced mobility of the PCBM molecules and, with good initial dispersion, allows for the formation of exaggerated grain growth within the polymer host. We have assembled these nanostructures within the regioregular conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). This PCBM elongated nanostructure formation maybe responsible for the very high efficiencies observed, at very low loadings of PCBM (1:0.6, polymer to PCBM), in annealed photovoltaics. Moreover, our high resolution TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy studies clearly show that the PCBM crystals remain crystalline and are unaffected by the 200-keV electron beam
3590	This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.
242	This research paper aims to investigate the shapes of molecular cloud cores in Orion, a star-forming region in the Milky Way. Using data from the Herschel Space Observatory, we analyze the distribution of dust emission in the cores and model their shapes using statistical methods. Our results show that the majority of the cores have elongated or irregular shapes, indicating the influence of external factors such as turbulence and magnetic fields on their formation. We also find evidence for a correlation between the shapes of the cores and their physical properties, such as mass and density. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex processes involved in the formation of stars and galaxies.
918	This research paper investigates the behavior of solitary and shock waves in discrete double power-law materials. The study focuses on the propagation of these waves in a one-dimensional lattice, where the material properties are described by a double power-law potential. The analysis is carried out using numerical simulations and analytical calculations. The results show that the material's nonlinearity and anisotropy significantly affect the characteristics of the waves, such as their amplitude, speed, and shape. Moreover, it is found that the presence of the double power-law potential leads to the formation of new types of waves, such as asymmetric solitary waves and oscillatory shock waves. These findings have implications for the design and control of materials with tailored mechanical properties, such as high-energy absorbing structures and impact-resistant materials.
3774	"The research paper ""Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data"" presents a method to construct effective interatomic potentials for quasicrystals using ab-initio data. The main theme of the paper is to provide a practical approach for the study of quasicrystals by developing simplified models that can be used to accurately predict their properties and behavior. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing the results of simulations using the effective potentials to those obtained from the ab-initio calculations. They conclude that their method is a promising tool for the study of quasicrystals and can lead to a better understanding of their unique properties."
3362	This research paper presents the results of an X-ray imaging study of the stellar population in RCW49, an active star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identified a total of 362 X-ray sources within the region, including a number of young, high-mass stars. Our analysis of the X-ray properties of these sources allowed us to estimate their ages, masses, and other physical characteristics. We also compared our results to previous studies of RCW49 and found that our sample of X-ray sources provides a more complete picture of the stellar population in the region. Overall, our study contributes to our understanding of the processes involved in star formation and the evolution of young, massive stars.
174	Surface roughness becomes relevant if typical length scales of the system are comparable to the scale of the variations as it is the case in microfluidic setups. Here, an apparent boundary slip is often detected which can have its origin in the assumption of perfectly smooth boundaries. We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations and introduce an ``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and valleys of the surface. Our simulations show good agreement with analytical results for sinusoidal boundaries, but can be extended to arbitrary geometries and experimentally obtained surface data. We find that the detected apparent slip is independent of the detailed boundary shape, but only given by the distribution of surface heights. Further, we show that the slip diverges as the amplitude of the roughness increases.
2756	"The research paper ""Measuring two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement"" discusses the measurement of entanglement between two photons with orbital angular momentum. The main theme is to explore the use of a holographic technique to measure the entanglement of photons with different orbital angular momentum states. The paper presents experimental results that show a clear correlation between the entanglement of the photons and the phase shift of the hologram. The conclusion drawn from the research is that the holographic technique provides a reliable method to measure the entanglement of photons with different orbital angular momentum states, which has important implications for quantum communication and quantum computing."
3111	The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT observations of gamma-ray binaries.
D2-53	"Lavoisier's Law, formally known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, is one of the fundamental principles in chemistry established by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century . The law states that In a closed system, matter is neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions or physical transformations . In simpler terms, the total mass of substances present before a chemical reaction equals the total mass after the reaction, even though the substances may change form. Lavoisier demonstrated this principle through meticulous experiments where he carefully measured the mass of reactants and products. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794), often called the ""father of modern chemistry,"" formulated this principle around 1774."
3162	We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system (atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.
3847	This research paper investigates the one-loop MHV rules and their application to pure Yang-Mills theory. By analyzing the scattering amplitudes of gluons, we derive the one-loop MHV rules and demonstrate their validity for pure Yang-Mills. Our results show that the MHV rules provide a powerful and efficient tool for calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory. Furthermore, we find that the MHV rules simplify the calculation of amplitudes, enabling more accurate predictions of physical observables. Our study highlights the potential of the MHV rules for future research in pure Yang-Mills theory and beyond.
3147	This research paper investigates one-dimensional Brownian particle systems with rank-dependent drifts. The authors introduce a general class of models, in which the drift of each particle depends on its current rank within the system. They provide a detailed analysis of the stationary state of the system, derive explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the particle positions, and investigate the behavior of the system in the limit of large particle numbers. The authors show that the rank-dependent drifts can lead to interesting and non-trivial effects in the system's dynamics, including the emergence of phase transitions and the formation of spatial patterns. These results have important implications for understanding the behavior of many-particle systems in a variety of physical and biological contexts.
507	Theory of magnetic deflagration (avalanches) in crystals of molecular magnets has been developed. The phenomenon resembles the burning of a chemical substance, with the Zeeman energy playing the role of the chemical energy. Non-destructive reversible character of magnetic deflagration, as well as the possibility to continuously tune the flammability of the crystal by changing the magnetic field, makes molecular magnets an attractive toy system for a detailed study of the burning process. Besides simplicity, new features, as compared to the chemical burning, include possibility of quantum decay of metastable spin states and strong temperature dependence of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions for criteria of the ignition of magnetic deflagration, and compute the ignition rate and the speed of the developed deflagration front.
2020	We present observations of a solar quiet region obtained by the ground-based Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and by instruments on the spacecraft SOHO and TRACE. The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.
3872	The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.
2172	We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects.
3202	This research paper explores the use of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (KCC) as a measure of randomness in short sequences. The KCC measures the minimum amount of information needed to generate a sequence, and has been used extensively in the study of algorithmic randomness. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the KCC for short sequences, showing that it can be an effective measure of randomness even for sequences of only a few bits. The authors also discuss the limitations of the KCC for short sequences, and propose several modifications to improve its accuracy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the study of randomness and complexity in computational systems.
2387	"The research paper titled ""Spitzer Observations of Low Luminosity Isolated and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies"" explores the properties of low-luminosity isolated galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies through Spitzer Space Telescope observations. The study reveals that these types of galaxies have a lower fraction of dust and gas compared to more massive galaxies and are likely to have formed through the gradual accretion of gas over a prolonged period. The findings suggest that low-luminosity isolated and low surface brightness galaxies could be crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and the interplay between dark matter, gas, and stars."
1438	We present calculations of the thermal and electric linear response in graphene, including disorder in the self-consistent t-matrix approximation. For strong impurity scattering, near the unitary limit, the formation of a band of impurity states near the Fermi level leads to that Mott's relation holds at low temperature. For higher temperatures, there are strong deviations due to the linear density of states. The low-temperature thermopower is proportional to the inverse of the impurity potential and the inverse of the impurity density. Information about impurity scattering in graphene can be extracted from the thermopower, either measured directly, or extracted via Mott's relation from the electron-density dependence of the electric conductivity.
1767	This research paper focuses on gauged renormalisation group (RG) transformations of lattice fermions. The aim is to investigate the behaviour of these transformations under gauge transformations and to explore their applicability to lattice gauge theories. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the RG transformations for a Wilson fermion and shows that they are gauge invariant. Furthermore, it is shown that the gauged RG transformations can be used to construct a gauge-invariant effective action for non-Abelian gauge theories. The results suggest that gauged RG transformations can be a powerful tool for the study of lattice gauge theories and could potentially lead to new insights into the physics of strong interactions.
1397	We have performed self-consistent 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD numerical simulations of jet formation as long as possible, including the dynamics of accretion disks. Although the previous nonsteady MHD simulations for astrophysical jets revealed that the characteristics of nonsteady jets are similar to those of steady jets, the calculation time of these simulations is very short compared with the time scale of observed jets. Thus we have investigated long term evolutions of mass accretion rate, mass outflow rate, jet velocity, and various energy flux. We found that the ejection of jet is quasi-periodic. The period of the ejection is related to the time needed for the initial magnetic filed to be twisted to generate toroidal filed. We compare our results with both the steady state theory and previous 2.5-dimensional nonsteady MHD simulations.
D2-83	"Metabolic engineering is a multidisciplinary field that applies principles of genetic engineering to modify cellular metabolism. Its goals encompass several key objectives: Production Optimization -  The fundamental aim of metabolic engineering is to mathematically model metabolic networks, calculate yields of useful products, and identify constraints in these networks.

2451	This research paper investigates the propagation of negative- and positive-phase-velocity waves in an isotropic chiral medium that moves at a constant velocity. The study employs the method of moments to derive the dispersion relation of the medium and analyze the effects of chirality and velocity on the waves' propagation. The results show that the medium's chirality affects the waves' frequency and that the waves can propagate in both directions relative to the medium's velocity. The study also reveals that the medium's velocity can significantly impact the waves' propagation and that the waves' phase velocities can exceed the speed of light in certain cases. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of wave propagation in chiral media and may have applications in fields such as telecommunications and material science.
2247	"The research paper ""Stars and the holographic upper bound on gravitational action"" explores the holographic principle and its implications for the gravitational action of stars. The authors propose a new holographic bound on the action of stars, which constrains the amount of information that can be contained within their gravitational fields. They apply this bound to several astrophysical systems, including neutron stars and black holes, and find that it is consistent with observational data. The authors conclude that the holographic principle provides a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental nature of gravity and the behavior of stars in the universe."
858	We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT. The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the Chellas' STIT.
834	We study the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium of magnetic flux tubes with circular cross sections embedded in a magnetic surrounding atmosphere. We solve the static momentum equation in 2.5D to obtain the thermodynamics that are consistent with a prescribed velocity and magnetic fields. We show that force balance is roughly satisfied if the flux tube's magnetic field is aligned with its axis. Equilibrium is guaranteed if this magnetic field possesses a transverse component. Several forms of this transverse field are investigated. The resulting magnetic field configurations are critically reviewed in terms of the results from spectropolarimetric observations. The thermodynamic structure that allows the flux tube to be in mechanical equilibrium is also calculated. We show that the inferred pressure, density and temperature stratification reproduce intensity features similar to dark core penumbral filaments and penumbral grains.
D2-10	"The origin of angiosperms (flowering plants) represents what Charles Darwin famously called an ""abominable mystery"" due to their apparent sudden appearance and rapid diversification in the fossil record. Modern research combines multiple lines of evidence to address this evolutionary puzzle. The fossil record shows unequivocal angiosperm evidence beginning in the Early Cretaceous (approximately 125-130 million years ago), with remarkably diverse forms appearing within 20-30 million years. Key early fossils include Archaefructus and Montsechia, with water lily relatives among the earliest documented flowering plants. Molecular evidence, however, suggests an earlier origin than fossils indicate. DNA-based phylogenies identify Amborella, water lilies, and Austrobaileyales as the earliest-diverging lineages. Molecular clock analyses often place angiosperm origins in the Jurassic period (145-201 million years ago)."
2852	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of persistent currents in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). SQUIDs are widely used in various applications, including magnetometry, quantum computing, and medical imaging. The persistent currents in SQUIDs are of great interest because they can provide a stable and sensitive measure of magnetic fields with a high degree of accuracy. However, the origin and behavior of these currents are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical and experimental aspects of persistent currents in SQUIDs, including their dependence on temperature, magnetic field, and material properties. We also examine the various techniques used to measure these currents and their potential applications in different fields. Our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental physics of superconductivity and could lead to the development of more efficient and effective SQUIDs for practical applications.
1844	This research paper delves into the concept of induced inflation, which suggests that the inflationary period in the early universe was initiated by the dynamics of a scalar field. The study specifically focuses on a 5D purely kinetic scalar field formalism on warped product spaces and explores its implications for the inflationary model. Through a detailed analysis of the field equations and the resulting cosmological solutions, the study finds that the formalism can lead to a successful inflationary scenario that matches observational data. The research also highlights the role of the extra dimensions in the inflationary dynamics and sheds light on the mechanism responsible for the generation of primordial perturbations. Overall, the study presents a novel approach to understanding the early universe and offers insights into the nature of inflation and the structure of the cosmos.
544	This research paper focuses on stochastic optimization algorithms and investigates their effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems. The primary focus is on comparing and analyzing the performance of three popular algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE). The study includes experiments on various benchmark functions and real-world problems. The results show that all three algorithms are capable of finding optimal solutions, but the performance varies depending on the problem type and size. Overall, the study concludes that PSO outperforms GA and DE in most cases and provides insights on the selection of appropriate algorithms for different optimization problems.
3407	The two-dimensional ionic Hubbard model is a theoretical model used to study the behavior of electrons in materials with both ionic and metallic properties. In this study, the focus was on the metallic phase of the model, which describes the behavior of electrons in a material with metallic properties. The researchers used computer simulations to explore the behavior of electrons in the metallic phase of the model and found that the behavior was highly dependent on the strength of the ionic interactions. They also found that the metallic phase could exhibit a variety of different behaviors, including superconductivity and magnetic ordering. The study provides important insights into the behavior of electrons in materials with both metallic and ionic properties, which could have important implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic properties.
D2-20	For a fossil to exist it needs to survive a long time. Many animals are active kills by predictors. In such cases one might find a few teeth but most bone and tissue is gone. In rain forests the amount of insects make finding anything unlikely. Any animal is quickly dissected. Bones often dissolve in the slightly acid rain. Good places to find fossils are hence riverbeds or banks where cold freezing water quickly kills the animal and sediments are readily available to bury the remains long enough to begin the next step in the fossilization process. Similarly lakes that break through a wall and empty might evaporate and have large amount of fish and other animals.
3381	"The research paper titled ""Nonholonomic Ricci Flows: Exact Solutions and Gravity"" explores the behavior of nonholonomic Ricci flows in the context of gravity. The authors investigate exact solutions of the nonholonomic Ricci flow equation and their implications for gravitational theories. They demonstrate that nonholonomic Ricci flows can be used to study the dynamics of spacetime in the presence of matter and energy. The paper also discusses the potential applications of these findings in cosmology and astrophysics. The main conclusion of the paper is that nonholonomic Ricci flows provide a powerful tool for understanding the complex dynamics of gravity and the evolution of spacetime."
438	This research paper explores the relationship between Hamiltonian graphs and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The primary theme is to investigate how the properties of Hamiltonian graphs can be utilized to solve the TSP efficiently. The study includes a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic and presents some significant findings. The research demonstrates that Hamiltonian graphs can be used to construct optimal solutions for the TSP and offer a promising approach for solving complex optimization problems. The study concludes that the use of Hamiltonian graphs can significantly improve the efficiency of TSP algorithms and may have practical implications for various real-world applications.
D1-7	Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers.In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities.
1922	Masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, which are ground states of light or/and heavy quarks and antiquarks, have been calculated in the framework of an extended model of quasi-independent quarks with absolute uncertainties about 30 MeV. It is shown that the assumption on equidistant discrete levels for a mean field energy does not contradict to existing data and permits to reduce a number of model parameters. It is obtained, that a difference between neighbouring mean field energy levels is flavour independent. Values of spin-spin interaction between quarks and antiquarks with different flavours in pseudoscalar and vector mesons are presented.
2923	Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in the Heisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and Kerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied via Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact of decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for beating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902 (2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an appreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an increase in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence effect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing information is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the enhancement is able to survive.
1617	This research paper explores the electronic structure of a graphene bilayer with a twist. Graphene has been extensively studied due to its unique electronic properties, but adding a twist to the bilayer structure introduces a new level of complexity. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how the twist affects the electronic band structure and density of states. We find that the twist introduces new states near the Fermi level, which could have potential applications in electronic devices. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the electronic properties of twisted graphene bilayers and pave the way for further exploration of their potential technological applications.
1525	This research paper presents an analysis of INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray binary system HER X-1. HER X-1 is a well-studied system that exhibits a 35-day periodicity in its X-ray emission, thought to be caused by the precession of its accretion disk. The INTEGRAL observations provide high-energy coverage of the system, allowing for a detailed investigation of the spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-ray emission. The results of this analysis provide important insights into the physical processes at work in HER X-1, and contribute to our understanding of the behavior of accreting X-ray binaries in general.
702	This paper investigates the non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles around rapidly rotating Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black holes. We analyze the behavior of test particles in the vicinity of these black holes and show that the presence of a negative cosmological constant can lead to a non-monotonic behavior in the velocity profile. We also examine the effects of the rotation parameter on the velocity profile and demonstrate that it can cause significant deviations from the monotonically increasing behavior observed in the case of non-rotating black holes. Our results have important implications for understanding the dynamics of objects in the vicinity of rapidly spinning black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant, and may have implications for astrophysical observations of these objects.
778	This research paper focuses on the Brundan-Kazhdan-Lusztig (BKL) and Super Duality Conjectures, which are two fundamental conjectures in the field of algebraic representation theory. The BKL conjecture is concerned with the representation theory of Lie algebras over finite fields, while the Super Duality Conjecture relates the representation theories of two different Lie superalgebras. Through a thorough analysis of various mathematical concepts and techniques, this paper provides a detailed exploration of these conjectures and their implications. The crucial finding of this research is that the BKL and Super Duality Conjectures are closely related and have deep connections to other areas of representation theory, including the study of modular representations and categorification. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of these conjectures in the broader context of algebraic representation theory and suggesting directions for future research.

1992	This research paper focuses on improving the actions and asymptotic scaling in lattice Yang-Mills theory. The study utilizes a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the relationship between the lattice spacing and the energy of the system. The results indicate that by introducing a new discretization scheme, the asymptotic scaling can be improved, leading to a more accurate description of the system's behavior at large distances. The research also identifies critical outcomes, including the importance of considering higher-order terms in the action and the need to account for finite volume effects. The conclusions highlight the potential of the proposed approach to enhance the understanding of the behavior of gauge theories and contribute to the development of efficient numerical simulations.
4016	Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in many quantum technologies. In this research paper, we investigate whether local interactions with not-completely-positive maps can increase entanglement. We introduce a novel technique to study the dynamics of entanglement and apply it to a set of model systems. We find that, under certain conditions, the entanglement between two subsystems can indeed increase due to the local interactions with not-completely-positive maps. This result has important implications for the design of quantum devices and sheds light on the fundamental questions of non-Markovianity and quantum correlations. Our work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the role of not-completely-positive maps in the dynamics of quantum entanglement.

The paper presents a comprehensive study of the various structures in the universe, including clusters, superclusters, filaments, and voids. The paper also discusses the current theories and models that explain the formation and evolution of galaxies within these structures. The outcomes of the study suggest that the distribution of galaxies and other cosmic structures is strongly influenced by dark matter and dark energy.

2433	"The research paper titled ""Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at irrational frustration"" investigates the behavior of Josephson-junction arrays at zero temperature and irrational frustration. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the resistive transition in the arrays and observe the role of irrational frustration in the process. The main findings of the study suggest that the resistive transition occurs at a critical value of frustration and the transition becomes sharper as the frustration becomes more irrational. The study also shows that the critical behavior of the transition is governed by the renormalization group fixed point, which is determined by the degree of irrationality of the frustration. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behavior of Josephson-junction arrays and could lead to the development of new types of superconducting devices."
2542	This research paper investigates the near- and far-infrared counterparts of millimeter dust cores in the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D. The study utilizes data from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope to analyze the properties and distribution of dust cores within the cloud. The results show that the majority of the dust cores have a corresponding infrared counterpart, indicating the presence of embedded protostars. The study also suggests that the distribution of these protostars may be influenced by the local environment. These findings contribute to our understanding of star formation in molecular clouds and have important implications for future studies.
1371	We report the observation of a compensation point in the temperature dependence of magnetization data of polycrystalline Sm2Al. Magnetization measurements show that this compound magnetically orders at about 150 K. Below this temperature, the magnetization data shows a compensation point, which shifts with field. Hysteresis loops obtained below the compensation temperature show that the compound possesses exchange anisotropy. Both the exchange anisotropy field and the coercive field are found to be quite large and comparable to those of the classical spin-orbit compensated ferromagnet (Sm,Gd)Al2. The heat capacity data also suggest that there are similarities between (Sm,Gd)Al2 and Sm2Al.
3442	The article discusses the monitoring of the neutron star 4U 1636-53 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. The study focuses on the long-term evolution of the system and the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in its X-ray emission. The authors analyze the data from RXTE observations spanning over a decade and conclude that the system's X-ray flux and kHz QPO properties undergo significant changes over time. They also suggest that the kHz QPOs might be associated with the accretion flow around the neutron star, and their evolution could provide insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring of X-ray binaries to understand their complex behavior and dynamics.
1366	"The search for exoplanets has been an area of intense research in recent years, with the discovery of thousands of planets outside our solar system. Among these exoplanets, the search for potentially habitable planets, or ""cryptoplanets,"" has been of particular interest. In this research paper, we provide an update on the latest findings in the search for cryptoplanets, including the detection methods used, the characteristics of known cryptoplanets, and the prospects for future discoveries. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the search for extraterrestrial life and the understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Our analysis suggests that while the search for cryptoplanets remains challenging, recent advancements in technology and observational techniques are bringing us closer to identifying potentially habitable worlds beyond our own."
1541	"The paper titled ""Influence of Orbital Behaviour and Chaos on the Shape of Dark Matter Halos"" explores the effect of chaotic orbits on the shape of dark matter halos. The study uses computer simulations to model the behavior of dark matter particles in halos and investigates the impact of chaotic motion on the shape of the halo. The researchers found that the chaotic orbits of dark matter particles can significantly alter the shape of the halo, causing it to become more elongated and distorted.

3316	This research paper investigates the broadening effects in Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) due to alloy scattering. QCLs are crucial for applications such as gas sensing and spectroscopy, but their performance is limited by the broadening of the gain spectrum.

In this paper, we explore the impact of alloy scattering on QCLs through theoretical modeling and experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms of alloy scattering and its potential applications in improving the performance of QCLs.
435	For every rational homology 3-sphere with 2-torsion only we construct a unified invariant (which takes values in a certain cyclotomic completion of a polynomial ring), such that the evaluation of this invariant at any odd root of unity provides the SO(3) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant at this root and at any even root of unity the SU(2) quantum invariant. Moreover, this unified invariant splits into a sum of the refined unified invariants dominating spin and cohomological refinements of quantum SU(2) invariants. New results on the Ohtsuki series and the integrality of quantum invariants are the main applications of our construction.

3490	The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper. Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii) the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism, characterized by the number of cams and their width.
1539	"The research paper titled ""On the detectability of non-trivial topologies"" investigates the ability of statistical methods to identify complex network structures.

D2-29	Synthetic biology emerged as a specialized branch of bioengineering over the last 15-20 years, propelled by the technologies of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis. The emphasis is now on characterizing molecular components and standardizing them so that they work together. Today, computer programming languages have become more abstract by building upon previous languages, making it easier and faster to create complex programs. Similarly, in the future, standardized molecular components will make biology understandable through abstraction. This will in turn make it easier to engineer new functions. Of course any biological abstraction would rely on molecular details (just like all computer code is finally executed as assembly), so studying molecular biology is very worthwhile.
2801	Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple (constant source function) and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet chromosphere, such as mottles/spicules, as well as for active region structures such as fibrils, arch filament systems (AFS), filaments and flares.

The study concludes that the Mock LISA data is a powerful tool for studying white dwarf binary systems and provides valuable insights into their physical properties.
D2-46	"Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, though it does not directly cause the disease. The connection between these conditions is so significant that healthcare professionals have coined the term ""diabesity"" to highlight that the majority of individuals with diabetes are obese or overweight demonstrates that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases linearly with rising body mass index. This explains why the worldwide increase in obesity prevalence has led to a corresponding surge in type 2 diabetes cases globally. The relationship works through several mechanisms: excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, affects insulin sensitivity and function. Some individuals with obesity can produce more insulin without overtaxing the pancreasy."

These results provide insight into the fundamental properties of Mn-doped ZnO and highlight the potential for further research in this area.
207	In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.
D2-75	"The Big Bang theory is an effort to explain what happened at the very beginning of our universe. Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing; during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment. According to the standard theory, our universe sprang into existence as ""singularity"" around 13.7 billion years ago. What is a ""singularity"" and where does it come from? Well, Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of ""black holes."""
1764	Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to investigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In particular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion reactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry energy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting result and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the theoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams.

The authors demonstrate that the type and thickness of the catalyst support strongly influence the growth behavior and resulting properties of the SWNTs. Specifically, a thin layer of alumina support leads to the growth of highly aligned SWNT forests with exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings for the design and optimization of SWNT-based devices and applications. Overall, the study sheds light on the complex interplay between catalyst support, growth conditions, and resulting SWNT properties, and provides important insights into the fundamental science of SWNT synthesis and growth.
1799	A spectroscopic method for staggered fermions based on thermodynamical considerations is proposed. The canonical partition functions corresponding to the different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit as polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the zero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is successfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched results are presented showing good agreement with that of standard spectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon and dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations are practically unreachable.
93	The radiation hardness of silicon charged particle sensors is compared with single crystal and polycrystalline diamond sensors, both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that for Si- and C-sensors, the NIEL hypothesis, which states that the signal loss is proportional to the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss, is a good approximation to the present data. At incident proton and neutron energies well above 0.1 GeV the radiation damage is dominated by the inelastic cross section, while at non-relativistic energies the elastic cross section prevails. The smaller inelastic nucleon-Carbon cross section and the light nuclear fragments imply that at high energies diamond is an order of magnitude more radiation hard than silicon, while at energies below 0.1 GeV the difference becomes significantly smaller.

3107	Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body Peierls'' state.
D1-19	There seems to be some merit to having a single daily glass of red wine, it seems to have something called resveratrol, which acts as an antioxidant and is thought to be good for your heart. Additionally, Italian researchers found that moderate beer drinkers had a 42 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to non-drinkers. For maximum protection, keep your consumption to one pint—at around 5 percent alcohol by volume—a day, the researchers say. Basically, alcohol, in moderation, appears to lower risks of heart and other cardiovascular disease.But this is in moderation, mind you. Just as with everything else, the only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. A beer a day is good; twelve is not.
641	We present measurements of current noise in quantum point contacts as a function of source-drain bias, gate voltage, and in-plane magnetic field. At zero bias, Johnson noise provides a measure of the electron temperature. At finite bias, shot noise at zero field exhibits an asymmetry related to the 0.7 structure in conductance. The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field. Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus (where shot noise vanishes), agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron heating.
2659	The article focuses on a survey of XMM-Newton spectra to investigate why some intermediate polars exhibit soft X-ray emissions. The authors analyzed the spectra of 26 intermediate polars and found that 11 of them showed soft X-ray emission. They concluded that the soft X-ray emission in intermediate polars is likely due to the presence of optically thick, magnetically confined accretion shocks. Additionally, they found that the properties of the soft X-ray emission varied among the intermediate polars, suggesting that there may be different physical mechanisms at play. This study provides insight into the complex accretion processes occurring in intermediate polars and highlights the importance of high-quality X-ray observations for studying these systems.
345	"The research paper titled ""Observing the gas temperature drop in the high-density nucleus of L 1544"" focuses on analyzing the temperature distribution in the nucleus of the L1544 molecular cloud using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The results of the study show that the gas temperature in the high-density region drops by a factor of two, which can be explained by the depletion of gas-phase CO molecules onto dust grains. This phenomenon is significant as it suggests that chemical and physical processes are tightly coupled in molecular clouds, affecting their evolution and star formation potential. The study highlights the importance of observing temperature gradients in molecular clouds to better understand their internal dynamics and evolution."
3161	This research paper investigates the anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon nanotubes. Through molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that the mode frequencies of tangential modes in carbon nanotubes shift unexpectedly with increasing pressure, contrary to the behavior of other types of modes. The cause of this phenomenon was traced to the lengthening of the carbon-carbon bonds in the nanotube due to pressure, which affects the effective spring constants of the tangential modes. The outcomes of this research provide new insights into the mechanical behavior of single-wall carbon nanotubes and have implications for their potential applications in nanoelectronics and nanomechanics.
651	In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable configuration is a small-world graph.
3018	This research paper focuses on the high energy variability of synchrotron-self Compton emitting sources and proposes that one zone models are insufficient to explain the observed variability. Through a thorough analysis of the data, the authors demonstrate that the variability is likely due to multiple emitting regions rather than a single zone. They propose a new model that incorporates multiple emitting regions and discuss the implications of this model for future research in this area. The critical outcome of this research is that a more accurate understanding of high energy variability in synchrotron-self Compton emitting sources will require more complex models that account for multiple emitting regions.
3225	This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth, but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic. Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit, closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a function of various system parameters.
1195	The research paper investigates the phenomenon of peak effect in polydisperse particle systems, which refers to the peak in the critical current density as a function of magnetic field. The authors study the disordering transitions that occur in such systems, which can lead to the formation of vortices and affect the peak effect. Using simulations and experiments, the authors explore the effects of particle size distribution, interparticle interactions, and other factors on the disordering transitions and peak effect. They find that the peak effect is determined by a delicate balance between disordering and ordering effects, and that polydispersity can enhance or suppress the peak effect depending on the specific system. The results of the study have implications for the design and optimization of superconducting materials and other particle systems with disordering transitions.
D2-11	These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter. People at high risk of not getting enough vitamin D, all children aged 1 to 4, and all babies (unless they're having more than 500ml of infant formula a day) should take a daily supplement throughout the year. There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19).
1747	This research paper examines the possibility of multi-graviton theories in the presence of a Dirac field. The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to show that such theories are not viable. They find that the introduction of a Dirac field leads to the appearance of non-renormalizable operators that cannot be absorbed into the gravitational interactions. This ultimately leads to inconsistencies in the theory and the breakdown of perturbative calculations. The authors conclude that multi-graviton theories cannot be formulated in the presence of a Dirac field, which has important implications for efforts to unify gravity with other fundamental forces.

The critical outcomes of this study indicate that the use of external energy sources, such as ultrasound and electric fields, can significantly improve the stability and performance of polymer aqueous solutions in 2D systems. The research concludes that the proposed energy solutions hold great potential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of polymer-based technologies and applications.
188	This paper proposes a novel algorithm for finding error-locators of algebraic-geometric codes that can eliminate the division-calculations of finite fields from the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm. This inverse-free algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors, generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic curves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to, and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each clock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for codes on algebraic curves.

467	We introduce a model-checking tool intended specially for the analysis of quantum information protocols. The tool incorporates an efficient representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of quantum computational tree logic (QCTL). The model-checking procedure treats quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.

41	In this paper, the equations of motion for geodesics in the neutral rotating Black Ring metric are derived and the separability of these equations is considered. The bulk of the paper is concerned with sets of solutions where the geodesic equations can be examined analytically - specifically geodesics confined to the axis of rotation, geodesics restricted to the equatorial plane, and geodesics that circle through the centre of the ring. The geodesics on the rotational axis behave like a particle in a potential well, while the geodesics confined to the equatorial plane mimic those of the Schwarzschild metric. It is shown that it is impossible to have circular orbits that pass through the ring, but some numerical results are presented which suggest that it is possible to have bound orbits that circle through the ring.

The paper concludes that the square gradient model is a valuable tool for predicting the properties of two-phase mixtures and can be applied to a wide range of systems."
D2-19	Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics. It involves a hypothetical scenario where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a poison mechanism. If the radioactive atom decays (a random quantum event), the poison is released, killing the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until observed, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states. This implies the cat would be simultaneously both alive and dead until someone opens the box to check. The experiment highlights the disconnect between quantum mechanical principles and our everyday experience of reality, challenging our understanding of observation.
D2-31	Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human health, primarily regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption for bone formation and maintenance. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight, but it can also be obtained through diet (fatty fish, egg yolks) and supplements. The recommended daily intake is 600-800 IU for most adults, though needs increase with age and limited sun exposure. Deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, muscle weakness, and potentially increased risk of certain chronic diseases. Factors affecting vitamin D status include geographical location, season, skin pigmentation, age, and dietary habits. Regular moderate sun exposure combined with dietary sources provides sufficient vitamin D for most people.
744	This research paper investigates the statistics of an unstable barotropic jet using a cumulant expansion. The main objective of this study is to understand the behavior of the jet's unstable modes and their impact on the statistical properties of the flow. The study shows that the barotropic jet's unstable modes play a critical role in determining its statistical properties, including the mean and variance of the velocity field. The researchers also find that the cumulant expansion provides an accurate representation of the flow statistics, even in the presence of strong instabilities. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of barotropic jets in the atmosphere and ocean, and for improving our ability to forecast their behavior.
54	This research paper analyses the error probability of peaky signaling over fading channels. The study considers the effects of fading on the peaky signaling, and derives the closed-form expressions for the error probability of the peaky signaling over Rayleigh and generalized fading channels. The results show that the error probability of the peaky signaling is significantly affected by the channel fading. It is also found that the performance of the peaky signaling is improved by increasing the peakiness factor. The findings of this study provide insights for the design of reliable communication systems over fading channels using peaky signaling.
3533	This research paper proposes a game-theoretic approach for power control in Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) wireless networks. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of the network while ensuring a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) for the users. The proposed algorithm is based on a non-cooperative game where each user autonomously adjusts its transmit power based on the channel conditions and the actions of the other users. The Nash equilibrium of the game is shown to exist and be unique under mild assumptions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional fixed power allocation schemes in terms of energy efficiency and fairness. The paper concludes that game theory can be a promising tool for power control in IR-UWB networks, providing a balance between energy efficiency and QoS.
3685	This research paper investigates the process of potassium intercalation in graphite using a van der Waals density-functional approach. The study examines the effects of various parameters, including the concentration and orientation of potassium atoms, on the intercalation process. The results indicate that the intercalation process is highly dependent on the orientation of the potassium atoms and the concentration of the intercalant. The study concludes that the van der Waals density-functional approach is an effective method for simulating the intercalation process in graphite and provides valuable insights into the behavior of intercalants in layered materials. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the intercalation process and has potential applications in the development of new materials for energy storage and other advanced technologies.
2354	We investigate possible mass shift and width broadening of J/psi in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rule. Input values of gluon condensates at finite temperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and pressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~ 1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results in change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the phenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach maximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.
2789	"Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices."
2358	The nucleation of carbon nanotubes on small nickel clusters is studied using a tight binding model coupled to grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. This technique closely follows the conditions of the synthesis of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition. The possible formation of a carbon cap on the catalyst particle is studied as a function of the carbon chemical potential, for particles of different size, either crystalline or disordered. We show that these parameters strongly influence the structure of the cap/particle interface which in turn will have a strong effect on the control of the structure of the nanotube. In particular, we discuss the presence of carbon on surface or in subsurface layers.
3259	This research paper examines the applicability of layered sine-Gordon models to layered superconductors, specifically focusing on the case of magnetic coupling. The study investigates the effects of magnetic coupling on the behavior of layered superconductors and evaluates the suitability of the layered sine-Gordon model in accurately describing their properties. The research involves numerical simulations and analysis of the results, leading to conclusions on the effectiveness of the model in predicting the behavior of layered superconductors in the presence of magnetic coupling. The findings of this study can provide useful insights into the behavior of layered superconductors and contribute to the development of more accurate models for their description.
795	We investigate dynamical systems characterized by a time series of distinct semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth. Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.
103	We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2) plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not observe the sustained growth.
3835	In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives.
2647	"One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D\""ur-Cirac (DC) method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems, there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled fraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial transposition."
3478	The Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that is valid for a chemical reaction that proceeds along the reaction coordinate over the transition state is extended to molecular dynamics trajectories that in general do not cross the dividing surface between the initial and the final local minima at the exact transition state. Our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle states that low energy molecular dynamics trajectories are more likely to lead into the basin of attraction of a low energy local minimum than high energy trajectories. In the context of global optimization schemes based on molecular dynamics our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle implies that using low energy trajectories one needs to visit a smaller number of distinguishable local minima before finding the global minimum than when using high energy trajectories.
1985	Average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions is proposed as a diagnostic probe of high density (saturation) physics. We show that by introducing and varying a transverse momentum cutoff in the definition of the average transverse momentum, one can eliminate the uncertainty in the overall magnitude of the leading order hadron production cross section in high energy collisions, and semi-quantitatively map the different dynamical regions predicted by the saturation physics. We discuss the applications of this method to pion production at RHIC and LHC and make quantitative predictions for the average transverse momentum of produced pions in the kinematics appropriate for the RHIC and LHC experiments.
3236	"The research paper titled ""The Solar-Interior Equation of State with the Path-Integral Formalism I. Domain of Validity"" presents a new approach to understanding the equation of state for the solar interior. The authors use the path-integral formalism to calculate the equation of state, which gives a more accurate description of the behavior of matter at high temperatures and densities. The study focuses on the domain of validity of the equation of state and found that the path-integral approach leads to a better agreement with observational data than previous models. The authors conclude that their new approach provides a more accurate description of the solar interior and can be applied to other astrophysical systems."
872	Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can send signals over more than 100 km standard optical fiber and are widely believed to be secure. Here, we show experimentally for the first time a technologically feasible attack, namely the time-shift attack, against a commercial QKD system. Our result shows that, contrary to popular belief, an eavesdropper, Eve, has a non-negligible probability (~4%) to break the security of the system. Eve's success is due to the well-known detection efficiency loophole in the experimental testing of Bell inequalities. Therefore, the detection efficiency loophole plays a key role not only in fundamental physics, but also in technological applications such as QKD.
478	This research paper focuses on the second discontinuity in the specific heat of two-phase superconductors. The authors investigate the relationship between the specific heat and the superconducting transition in these materials, and present experimental data that suggests the existence of a second discontinuity in the specific heat curve. They propose a theoretical model that explains this phenomenon and discuss the implications of their findings for the understanding of superconductivity. The paper concludes that the second discontinuity in the specific heat represents a new aspect of the superconducting phase transition and opens up new avenues for research in this field.
2758	This research paper presents HST/ACS coronagraphic observations of the circumstellar dust surrounding HD 100546. The primary focus of the study was to investigate the structure and composition of the dust disk. The authors found that the disk has a complex morphology with multiple dust components, including a bright inner disk and a faint outer halo. They also identified several features that may be indicative of planet formation, such as gaps and asymmetries in the disk. The study provides new insights into the early stages of planet formation and highlights the importance of high-resolution imaging for studying circumstellar disks.
3958	We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) gates.
2517	This research paper presents a novel approach to network coding using a Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DDGA). Network coding is a technique that enables efficient data transmission over networks by allowing intermediate nodes to combine and transform data packets. However, traditional approaches to network coding can be computationally expensive and difficult to optimize. The proposed DDGA approach addresses these challenges by using a genetic algorithm that incorporates both population and individual level distributions. This allows for a more efficient and effective search for optimal network coding solutions. Simulation results show that the DDGA approach outperforms traditional genetic algorithms and other state-of-the-art network coding techniques in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of network coding in a variety of applications.
3976	Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
1831	We propose a technique aimed at cooling a harmonically oscillating mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state starting from room temperature. Our method, which involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside an optical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangements being used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping, and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed mostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are expected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror closer to completion.
1030	This paper proposes an approach to training rough set models using Bayesian framework trained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The prior probabilities are constructed from the prior knowledge that good rough set models have fewer rules. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is conducted through sampling in the rough set granule space and Metropolis algorithm is used as an acceptance criteria. The proposed method is tested to estimate the risk of HIV given demographic data. The results obtained shows that the proposed approach is able to achieve an average accuracy of 58% with the accuracy varying up to 66%. In addition the Bayesian rough set give the probabilities of the estimated HIV status as well as the linguistic rules describing how the demographic parameters drive the risk of HIV.
1984	This research paper investigates atom-wave diffraction in the Raman-Nath and Bragg regime, focusing on the effective Rabi frequency, losses, and phase shifts. The study shows that the diffraction pattern is highly dependent on the regime and the atom-light interaction parameters. It was found that losses due to spontaneous emission and decoherence effects play a significant role in the diffraction process. Furthermore, the phase shifts were observed to be influenced by the interplay between the diffraction regime and the atom-light interaction parameters. The study concludes that a comprehensive understanding of the atom-wave diffraction process is essential for the design and implementation of atom interferometers and other quantum technologies.
262	"The research paper titled ""HD 98800: A 10-Myr-Old Transition Disk"" investigates the properties of a young star system. The main theme of the paper is to understand the evolution and properties of transition disks, which are disks of gas and dust around young stars that are thought to be in the process of forming planets. The researchers used several telescopes and instruments to study the star system HD 98800 and found that it has a transition disk that is likely around 10 million years old. The paper discusses the properties of the disk, including its size, temperature, and composition, and the implications for the formation of planets. The researchers conclude that understanding the properties of transition disks like the one around HD 98800 is critical to understanding the early stages of planet formation."
1569	"The research paper titled ""Topological Winding and Unwinding in Metastable Bose-Einstein Condensates"" explores the behavior of a metastable Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subjected to a rotating potential. The study focuses on the formation of topological defects, specifically vortices, in the BEC and how they evolve over time. The authors investigate the dynamics of the vortices and their interactions with other defects, such as antivortices. They find that the vortices can undergo a process of unwinding, in which they merge with antivortices and disappear, or winding, in which they split and create new vortices. The study provides insight into the behavior of metastable BECs and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications."
2050	The study focuses on the detection of single electron spin resonance in a double quantum dot, which has potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics. The researchers used a combination of microwave and radio frequency pulses to manipulate the spin state of a single electron in the double quantum dot, and were able to detect the resulting resonance signal. This represents a significant step forward in understanding and controlling spin states at the single electron level. The study's outcomes could pave the way for the development of more efficient and accurate quantum computing systems, as well as improved magnetic sensing and imaging technologies.
2952	We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.
398	The quiet Sun has been a topic of interest for solar physicists for decades. Recent studies have shown a discrepancy in G-band contrast measurements, indicating that the quiet Sun may not be as homogeneous as previously believed. In this research paper, we investigate this discrepancy in G-band contrast and explore possible explanations for the observed variations. Using high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyze G-band contrast in different regions of the quiet Sun. Our results suggest that the discrepancy in G-band contrast is related to the presence of small-scale magnetic fields and their interaction with convective motions. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the quiet Sun's magnetic field and its role in the Sun's activity cycle.
665	A recent, major, puzzle in the core-level photoemission spectra of doped manganites is the observation of a 1-2 eV wide shoulder with intensity varying with temperature T as the square of the magnetization over a T scale of order 200K, an order of magnitude less than electronic energies. This is addressed and resolved here, by extending a recently proposed two electron fluid l-b model for these systems to include core-hole effects. The shoulder arises from a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the highly localized (l) and band-like (b) states. Furthermore, our theory leads to a correspondence between spectral changes due to increasing doping and decreasing T, as experimentally observed.
3836	This research paper explores the new algebraic aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory. The algebraic approach to Quantum Field Theory has been gaining momentum recently as it provides a systematic and rigorous framework for studying perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena in Quantum Field Theory. In this paper, we review the recent developments in the algebraic approach to Quantum Field Theory and discuss its applications to perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena. We also present new algebraic techniques that have been developed for studying Quantum Field Theory and discuss their applications to various physical systems. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the new algebraic aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory and highlights the potential of these new techniques for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics.
1670	"The article ""Dissipation in graphene and nanotube resonators"" discusses the study of dissipation (loss of energy) in resonators made of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The authors use a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to investigate the mechanisms of dissipation in these materials. They find that dissipation in graphene resonators is dominated by two-level systems, while dissipation in carbon nanotube resonators is dominated by surface defects. They also show that dissipation can be reduced by using isotopically purified materials and by manipulating the shape and size of the resonators. Overall, the study provides insights into the fundamental physics of dissipation in nanoscale resonators and offers potential strategies for improving their performance in various applications."
391	The paper discusses the observation and analysis of relativistic X-ray lines emitted from the inner accretion disks around black holes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of these lines in order to accurately measure the mass and spin of black holes and to study the physics of accretion disks. The paper presents observations of X-ray lines from several black holes and discusses the implications of these observations for understanding the properties of accretion disks and black holes. The authors conclude that the study of relativistic X-ray lines is an important tool for understanding the physics of black holes and accretion disks.
654	This research paper explores the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as a means of achieving ensemble learning for free. The study investigates several different EA-based approaches to ensemble learning, comparing their performance with traditional ensemble learning methods and analyzing the impact of various factors on their effectiveness. The results of the study show that EA-based ensemble learning can be a powerful tool for improving classification accuracy, particularly when used in conjunction with other optimization techniques. The paper concludes that EA-based ensemble learning is a promising approach for achieving improved classification accuracy in a wide range of applications.
1172	Recent experimental work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions have revealed quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization which is fractional in the bipolar regime and integer in the unipolar regime in terms of quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime the electron and hole modes can mix at the p-n boundary, leading to current partition and quantized shot noise plateaus similar to those of conductance, while in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle-hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.
522	This research paper proposes a methodology for identifying network communities with high resolution, which captures their primary focus and important discoveries or conclusions. The proposed approach is based on a combination of clustering algorithms and community detection techniques that are optimized to identify the most relevant nodes and edges within the network. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel method that can be applied to a wide range of network structures, including social networks, biological networks, and technological networks. The results of empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying network communities with high precision and accuracy, thereby opening up new avenues for research in this field.
947	About a dozen field RR Lyrae stars have been observed with the 24-inch Heyde-Zeiss telescope of the Konkoly Observatory at Sv\'abhegy, Budapest, since its refurbishment in 2003. Most of the observing time is allocated for the investigation of the Blazhko modulation, a phenomenon that still does not have a satisfactory explanation. The obtained multicolour CCD observations are unique in extent. The accuracy of the measurements makes it possible to detect low amplitude modulation of the light curve as well. The discovery of Blazhko stars with low modulation amplitudes warns that the incidence rate of the Blazhko modulation is, in fact, much larger than it was previously expected. This makes the efforts exploring the cause of the modulation even more important. A summary of our measurements and results achieved during the last 3 years is presented.
1761	The research paper discusses the observations of the blazar Mrk 421 during an active phase using the INTEGRAL and multiwavelength telescopes. The study found that the blazar was emitting high-energy gamma rays during the active phase, with the emissions being stronger than those observed during quiescent periods. The observations also revealed a correlation between the high-energy gamma rays and the emission in other energy bands, indicating a common origin for the emissions. The findings suggest that the blazar's emission is produced by accelerated particles interacting with magnetic fields and photons. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the physics of blazar emission and the processes by which these objects release energy.
105	It was presented by Cabello and Nakamura [A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 190401 (2003)], that the Kochen-Specker theorem applies to two dimensions if one uses Positive Operator-Valued Measures. We show that contextuality in their models is not of the Kochen-Specker type. It is rather the result of not keeping track of the whole system on which the measurement is performed. This is connected to the fact that there is no one-to-one correspondence between POVM elements and projectors on the extended Hilbert space and the same POVM element has to originate from two different projectors when used in Cabello's and Nakamura's models. Moreover, we propose a hidden-variable formulation of the above models.
2849	The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding, is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme, achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer considerable improvements over these existing results.
1072	This research paper presents a novel method for generating isolated sub-100-attosecond pulses by controlling electron dynamics. The method involves using a two-color laser field to ionize an atom and then drive the resulting electron wave packet back towards the ion core, where it interacts with the residual ion potential to produce high-energy harmonics. By carefully adjusting the laser parameters and the ionization time, the researchers were able to produce isolated attosecond pulses with durations as short as 70 attoseconds. The results of this study provide a promising pathway towards the development of ultrafast light sources for a wide range of applications in materials science, chemistry, and biology.
2158	We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo.
2526	"The research paper ""Kinetic Theory for Binary Granular Mixtures at Low-Density"" focuses on the development of a kinetic theory for binary mixtures of granular particles at low densities. The primary focus is to derive equations that describe the behavior of the mixture under different conditions, such as varying size or composition ratios. The authors use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to validate their theory and analyze the results. The paper highlights important outcomes such as the emergence of non-equilibrium phenomena, the impact of size and composition ratios on the mixture, and the limitations of the theory. Overall, the research presents a useful framework for understanding the behavior of binary granular mixtures at low densities and has potential applications in various fields such as materials science and engineering."
3275	The Navier-Stokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder. This formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergence-free by construction, but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order, whose boundary conditions are coupled. The influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems. The magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior. The influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number.
3719	The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times.
2062	The concept of parity in particle physics has been a topic of interest for many years. Parity is a fundamental property of particles that describes how they behave under mirror reflection. In this research paper, we explore the phenomenon of parity doubling in particle physics. Parity doubling is a theory that suggests that particles can exist in pairs, where one particle has positive parity and the other has negative parity. We analyze data from particle colliders to investigate whether this theory is supported by experimental evidence. Our results suggest that parity doubling may indeed be present in some particles, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential applications of parity doubling in particle physics.
363	This research paper presents a comprehensive modeling study of radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The main objective of this study is to understand the physics behind the generation and behavior of radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The study investigates the effect of various parameters such as gas pressure, frequency, and power on the discharge characteristics. The results of the study highlight the importance of the plasma sheath in determining the discharge characteristics and the need for accurate modeling of the sheath region. The study also shows that the discharge characteristics are strongly dependent on the frequency and power of the applied voltage. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the generation and behavior of radio-frequency discharges in oxygen and can be used to optimize the performance of plasma-based applications such as surface treatment, etching, and deposition.
3040	This research paper explores the significance of wide field surveys in expanding our understanding of the astronomical discovery space. With the advent of new technologies, astronomers now have the ability to conduct large, systematic surveys of the sky, enabling them to uncover new and exciting discoveries. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of wide field surveys and their potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Through a thorough review of recent studies and advancements in astronomical research, this paper argues that wide field surveys have the potential to uncover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astronomy and push the boundaries of our knowledge of the cosmos.
721	We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson loops.
2566	We argue that claims about magnetic field dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth lambda, which were made on the basis of moun-spin-rotation studies of some superconductors, originate from insufficient accuracy of theoretical models employed for the data analysis. We also reanalyze some of already published experimental data and demonstrate that numerical calculations of Brandt [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 68, 54506 (2003)] may serve as a reliable and powerful tool for the analysis of the data collected in experiments with conventional superconductors. Furthermore, one can use this approach in order to distinguish between conventional and unconventional superconductors. It is unfortunate that these calculations have practically never been employed for such analyses.
2303	"The research paper titled ""Tait's conjectures and odd crossing number amphicheiral knots"" explores the properties of amphicheiral knots, which are mirror images of each other. The paper focuses on Tait's conjectures, which suggest that certain properties of a knot can be determined solely by its planar diagram. The authors provide new evidence for these conjectures by examining odd crossing number amphicheiral knots, and show that they satisfy Tait's conjectures. The paper also introduces new techniques for studying knots and provides insights into the symmetry and topology of amphicheiral knots. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of Tait's conjectures in understanding the properties of knots and sheds light on the fascinating world of knot theory."
537	We study Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a two-band boson Hubbard model, which can be mapped onto a spin-1/2 XY model with spins coupled to an additional Ising degree of freedom. By using a modified mean field theory that include the effects of phase fluctuations, we show that the transition is first order at both zero and finite temperatures. On the Mott insulator side, there may be reentrance in phase transition. These features are consequences of the underlying transition between competing defect poor and defect rich phases. The relevance of the model and our results to supersolid 4He and cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices are discussed.
2629	"Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk. We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of the ""Central Limit Theorem"" useful to study large portfolio losses. Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis."
D2-60	The dangers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, stem from their persistence in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate in living organisms. Known as 'forever chemicals,' PFAS do not break down easily, leading to long-term environmental contamination. They are found in products like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and water-repellent textiles. PFAS can enter the human body through contaminated drinking water and food, particularly in areas near industrial sites. Prolonged exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including certain cancers, hormonal disruptions, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, PFAS contribute to ecosystem harm by affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Their long-lasting nature makes them a significant environmental and public health concern, as they are challenging to eliminate.
D2-96	Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[19] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[20][21] Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years until disappearing in the late 15th century. The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
2190	We investigate one of the consequences of the twisted Poincare symmetry. We derive the charge conservation law and show that the equivalence principle is satisfied in the canonical noncommutative spacetime. We applied the twisted Poincare symmetry to the Weinberg's analysis. To this end, we generalize our earlier construction of the twisted S matrix \cite{Bu}, which apply the noncommutativity to the fourier modes, to the massless fields of integer spins. The transformation formula for the twisted S matrix for the massless fields of integer spin has been obtained. For massless fields of spin 1, we obtain the conservation of charge, and the universality of coupling constant for massless fields of spin 2, which can be interpreted as the equality of gravitational mass and inertial mass, i.e., the equivalence principle.
1432	This research paper aims to investigate the reason behind the observed lower X-ray luminosity of accreting T Tauri stars when compared to non-accretors. The primary theme is to understand the mechanism of X-ray emission in these stars and to determine how accretion affects their X-ray luminosity. Based on a review of existing literature and analysis of observational data, the study concludes that the lower X-ray luminosity is likely due to the presence of dense accretion disks that absorb and reprocess X-rays. The study also suggests that the accretion process itself may play a role in reducing X-ray emission. These findings have implications for our understanding of star formation and the role of accretion in shaping the properties of young stars.
493	We study the growth of a directed transportation network, such as a food web, in which links carry resources. We propose a growth process in which new nodes (or species) preferentially attach to existing nodes with high indegree (in food-web language, number of prey) and low outdegree (or number of predators). This scheme, which we call inverse preferential attachment, is intended to maximize the amount of resources available to each new node. We show that the outdegree (predator) distribution decays at least exponentially fast for large outdegree and is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a delta function. The indegree (prey) distribution is poissonian in the large-network limit.
3232	"The research paper ""New Terms for the Compact Form of Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian"" presents a new approach to describing the interactions between the electroweak fields in a compact form. The authors introduce new terms into the chiral Lagrangian that allow for a more accurate description of the electroweak interactions. The paper also discusses the implications of these new terms for the Higgs boson and the electroweak phase transition. The results of the study suggest that the new terms improve the precision of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and provide a more complete picture of the electroweak interactions. The study's conclusions highlight the importance of continuing research in this area to better understand the fundamental forces of nature."
1231	The full three dimensional dispersion of the pi-bands, Fermi velocities and effective masses are measured with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and compared to first-principles calculations. The band structure by density-functional theory strongly underestimates the slope of the bands and the trigonal warping effect. Including electron-electron calculation on the level of the GW approximation, however, yields remarkable agreement in the vicinity of the Fermi level. This demonstrates the breakdown of the independent electron picture in semi-metallic graphite and points towards a pronounced role of electron correlation for the interpretation of transport experiments and double-resonant Raman scattering for a wide range of carbon based materials.
1421	We compare the roles of fidelity and entanglement in characterizing renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions. It turns out that the scaling parameter extracted from fidelity for different ground states succeeds to capture nontrivial information including stable and unstable fixed points, whereas the von Neumann entropy as a bipartite entanglement measure (or equivalently, majorization relations satisfied by the spectra of the reduced density matrix along renormalization group flows) often fails, as far as the intrinsic irreversibility-information loss along renormalization group flows-is concerned. We also clarify an intimate connection between the von Neumman entropy, majorization relations, and fidelity. The relevance to Zamolodchikov's c theorem is indicated.
1522	The classical Ehresmann-Bruhat order describes the possible degenerations of a pair of flags in a finite-dimensional vector space V; or, equivalently, the closure of an orbit of the group GL(V) acting on the direct product of two full flag varieties. We obtain a similar result for triples consisting of two subspaces and a partial flag in V; this is equivalent to describing the closure of a GL(V)-orbit in the product of two Grassmannians and one flag variety. We give a rank criterion to check whether such a triple can be degenerated to another one, and we classify the minimal degenerations. Our methods involve only elementary linear algebra and combinatorics of graphs (originating in Auslander-Reiten quivers).
179	This paper presents a geometric description of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on Lie affgebroids subject to affine nonholonomic constraints. We define the notion of nonholonomically constrained system, and characterize regularity conditions that guarantee that the dynamics of the system can be obtained as a suitable projection of the unconstrained dynamics. It is shown that one can define an almost aff-Poisson bracket on the constraint AV-bundle, which plays a prominent role in the description of nonholonomic dynamics. Moreover, these developments give a general description of nonholonomic systems and the unified treatment permits to study nonholonomic systems after or before reduction in the same framework. Also, it is not necessary to distinguish between linear or affine constraints and the methods are valid for explicitly time-dependent systems.
1547	This research paper aims to investigate the properties and behavior of directed relativistic blast waves, which are powerful and highly energetic phenomena that occur in astrophysical environments such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. The study will focus on analyzing the dynamics of these blast waves, including their formation, propagation, and interaction with surrounding matter. The research will employ numerical simulations and theoretical analysis to explore the physical mechanisms that govern the behavior of directed relativistic blast waves, and to identify the key factors that influence their evolution and impact. The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of the nature of astrophysical explosions and their effects on the surrounding environment, and may have implications for the development of models and simulations of these phenomena.
18	We experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in superconducting phase qubits driven by microwave pulses. In a wide range of temperatures, we find that both the decay time and the amplitude of these coherent oscillations remain nearly unaffected by thermal fluctuations. The oscillations are observed well above the crossover temperature from thermally activated escape to quantum tunneling for undriven qubits. In the two-level limit, coherent qubit response rapidly vanishes as soon as the energy of thermal fluctuations kT becomes larger than the energy level spacing of the qubit. Our observations shed new light on the origin of decoherence in superconducting qubits. The experimental data suggest that, without degrading already achieved coherence times, phase qubits can be operated at temperatures much higher than those reported till now.
2871	This research paper explores the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles. The central focus is on examining the behavior of magnetic particles at low temperatures and how they interact with each other to form frozen states. The study uses simulations and experiments to investigate the magnetic properties of these systems. The outcomes of the study reveal that the magnetic particles exhibit highly correlated behavior, and their interactions lead to the formation of a frozen state. The paper concludes that understanding the Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic particles is vital for developing new materials with unique magnetic properties.
2650	An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.
2031	In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.
3140	This research paper focuses on the development of conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. Invariant functionals are mathematical expressions that remain unchanged under certain transformations. Compositions, on the other hand, refer to the act of combining two or more functions to create a new one. In this study, we apply the Noether's theorem to derive the conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by considering several examples, including systems governed by differential equations. The results of this study have important implications for the fields of physics, mathematics, and engineering, as conservation laws are fundamental to understanding the behavior of physical systems. Our findings can be used to develop more accurate models and simulations of complex systems, ultimately leading to improved design and control strategies.
2107	This research paper investigates the origin of very high energy gamma rays observed from supernova remnants and their implications for the interstellar radiation field in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), the study shows that these gamma rays are likely produced through the interaction of accelerated particles with the interstellar medium. The results also provide new constraints on the intensity and spectrum of the interstellar radiation field, which is an important factor in understanding the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the complex processes involved in the evolution of supernova remnants and the interstellar medium, with important implications for high-energy astrophysics and particle physics.
3991	An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.
1283	A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images was developed in the framework of the MAGIC-5 Italian project. One of the main goals of this project is to build a distributed database of lung CT scans in order to enable automated image analysis through a data and cpu GRID infrastructure. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system, a dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier for false-positive finding reduction, are described. The system was designed and tested for both internal and sub-pleural nodules. The results obtained on the collected database of low-dose thin-slice CT scans are shown in terms of free response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves and discussed.
3240	This research paper explores the use of free zero-range processes on networks as a basis for studying complex systems. Zero-range processes have been widely used in the study of particle systems, but their application to networked systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the properties of free zero-range processes on networks and demonstrate their usefulness in modeling a range of phenomena, from traffic flow to the spread of disease. We also provide a theoretical framework for analyzing these processes and discuss their potential applications in fields such as physics, biology, and engineering. Our findings suggest that free zero-range processes on networks offer a promising approach for understanding the behavior of complex systems and may lead to new insights and discoveries in a variety of fields.
1870	We look for wide, faint companions around members of the 5 Myr Lambda Orionis open cluster. We used optical, near-infrared, and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. We report the discovery of a very wide very low mass visual binary, LOri167, formed by a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass candidate located at 5 arcsec, which seems to belong to the cluster. We derive Teff of 2125 and 1750 K. If they are members, comparisons with theoretical models indicate masses of 17 (20-15) Mjup and 8 (13-7) Mjup, with a projected separation of 2000 AU. Such a binary system would be difficult to explain in most models, particularly those where substellar objects form in the disks surrounding higher mass stars.
3820	"This research paper explores the relationship between linkedness and ordered cycles in directed graphs (digraphs). The primary focus is on characterizing the minimum number of linked vertices required to contain all ordered cycles of a digraph. The authors introduce a concept called ""ordered cycle number"" to measure this quantity and provide upper and lower bounds for it. They also investigate the properties of digraphs with a small ordered cycle number and provide examples of digraphs with different ordered cycle numbers. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of the structure and complexity of digraphs by providing insights into the interplay between linkedness and ordered cycles."
D1-11	"The basic idea of biological evolution is that populations and species of organisms change over time. Today, when we think of evolution, we are likely to link this idea with one specific person: the British naturalist Charles Darwin. In the 1850s, Darwin wrote an influential and controversial book called On the Origin of Species. In it, he proposed that species evolve (or, as he put it, undergo ""descent with modification""), and that all living things can trace their descent to a common ancestor. Darwin also suggested a mechanism for evolution: natural selection, in which heritable traits that help organisms survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time."
4028	The research paper investigates the nucleation and growth of multiple metastable phases in a generalized Potts model. The study finds that the competitive nucleation of multiple phases can lead to a violation of the Ostwald rule, which states that the most stable phase is the first to nucleate and grow. Instead, the less stable phase can become dominant due to its faster nucleation rate. The research also shows that the nucleation and growth behavior can be influenced by the system's parameters, such as the size of the critical nucleus. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex nucleation and growth phenomena in materials science and highlights the importance of considering multiple metastable phases in modeling these processes.
3957	This research paper investigates the effects of allene and propyne doping on rich methane premixed laminar flames. The study aims to understand the impact of these light unsaturated hydrocarbons on the flame structure and combustion characteristics. The experiments were conducted using a burner stabilized flame, and the results were analyzed using laser-based diagnostics. The findings indicate that both allene and propyne doping increase the flame speed and reduce the flame thickness, indicating enhanced combustion efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of allene and propyne leads to the formation of new intermediate species, which have significant implications for the overall combustion process. These results offer critical insights into the use of light unsaturated hydrocarbons as fuel additives to improve the efficiency and reduce emissions in combustion systems.
339	In this paper we investigate a class of swing options with firm constraints in view of the modeling of supply agreements. We show, for a fully general payoff process, that the premium, solution to a stochastic control problem, is concave and piecewise affine as a function of the global constraints of the contract. The existence of bang-bang optimal controls is established for a set of constraints which generates by affinity the whole premium function. When the payoff process is driven by an underlying Markov process, we propose a quantization based recursive backward procedure to price these contracts. A priori error bounds are established, uniformly with respect to the global constraints.
353	A comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for the pair-creation contact process is presented. In contrast to the ordinary contact process, whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation is added to the pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical series expansions which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process. Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations.
1390	This research paper explores the concept of higher-order theories and their application in cognitive science and philosophy of mind. Higher-order theories posit that conscious mental states are those that are accompanied by higher-order thoughts or beliefs about those mental states. The paper examines the historical background and various formulations of higher-order theories, including the debate between first-order and higher-order theories. It also considers the implications of higher-order theories for understanding consciousness, self-awareness, and the relationship between mental states and brain states. The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of higher-order theories and directions for future research.
1083	We investigate the behavior of a circuit QED device when the resonator is initially populated with a mesoscopic coherent field. The strong coupling between the cavity and the qubit produces an entangled state involving mesoscopic quasi-pointer states with respect to cavity dissipation. The overlap of the associated field components results in collapse and revivals for the Rabi oscillation. Although qubit relaxation and dephasing do not preserve these states, a simple analytical description of the dissipative dynamics of the circuit QED device including cavity relaxation as well as qubit dissipation is obtained from the Monte-Carlo approach. Explicit predictions for the spontaneous and induced Rabi oscillation signals are derived and sucessfully compared with exact calculations. We show that these interesting effects could be observed with a 10 photon field in forthcoming circuit QED experiments.
3663	This research paper focuses on the convergence of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and presents an extrapolation technique to improve its accuracy. The DDA is widely used to model electromagnetic scattering from particles, but it suffers from slow convergence, particularly for large and highly absorbing particles. In this paper, we propose an extrapolation technique that combines results from DDA simulations with different grid sizes, enabling us to achieve higher accuracy with a lower computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by comparing the results with reference solutions for several test cases. Our results show that the extrapolation technique significantly improves the convergence rate of the DDA, leading to more accurate and efficient simulations. This technique has potential applications in various fields, including atmospheric and environmental sciences, material science, and biomedical engineering.
3758	This research paper presents a new approach to understanding polarization optics, using the mathematical framework of Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). The ensemble approach to polarization optics is explored, and a POVM-based model is developed to describe the behavior of polarized light passing through optical systems. The paper shows that the POVM approach offers a powerful and flexible way to analyze and design polarization optics, and can lead to new insights into the nature of polarization phenomena. The main result of the paper is the development of a POVM-based formalism for polarization optics, which is shown to be mathematically rigorous and physically meaningful. The conclusion is that the POVM approach represents a valuable new tool for researchers in the field of polarization optics, with potential applications in areas such as optical communication, imaging, and sensing.
D2-99	The main causes of lung cancer are multifaceted and involve a combination of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. The most significant risk factor is smoking, including both active smoking and secondhand exposure. Cigarettes release numerous harmful chemicals that damage lung cells over time, increasing the likelihood of cancer development. While not everyone who smokes develops lung cancer, the risk is considerably higher for smokers compared to non-smokers. Radon, a radioactive gas found in certain soil types, is another major contributor. It can accumulate in homes and buildings, posing a long-term health risk if exposure levels are high. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, such as emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, as well as cooking fumes from coal or wood.
2299	This research paper explores the behavior of global-string and vortex superfluids in a supersymmetric scenario. The study employs a theoretical framework that incorporates both global strings and vortices, as well as a supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particle physics. The paper shows that the interactions between global strings and vortices in this scenario can lead to the formation of stable, topologically protected superfluids. The authors analyze the properties of these superfluids, including their energy density, superfluid currents, and vortex distributions. They also demonstrate that the presence of supersymmetry can significantly alter the dynamics of these systems, leading to new and interesting phenomena. Overall, the paper provides important insights into the behavior of global-string and vortex superfluids in a supersymmetric scenario, with potential implications for a range of fields, including condensed matter physics, cosmology, and particle physics.
423	In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry. We also consider possible improvements to existing text entry evaluation metrics, such as the minimum string distance error rate, keystrokes per character, cost per correction, and a unified approach proposed by MacKenzie, so they can accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese text. Current methods lack an integrated concern about both typing speed and accuracy for Chinese text entry evaluation. Our goal is to remove the bias that arises due to human factors. First, we propose a new metric, called the correction penalty (P), based on Fitts' law and Hick's law. Next, we transform it into the approximate amortized cost (AAC) of information theory. An analysis of the AAC of Chinese text input methods with different context lengths is also presented.
3601	"The research paper titled ""The alternating sign matrix polytope"" investigates a mathematical object called the alternating sign matrix polytope (ASMP). The ASMP is a convex polytope that can be defined as the set of all real-valued matrices whose entries are either 0 or 1 and satisfy certain conditions. The authors of this paper study the geometric and combinatorial properties of the ASMP, including its volume, facet structure, and connections to other mathematical objects such as the tessellation of a hyperplane arrangement. They also provide a characterization of the vertices of the ASMP and prove that it is the convex hull of a finite set of points. The main conclusion of the paper is that the ASMP is a rich and interesting mathematical object that has important applications in various fields such as combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and statistical mechanics."
1446	We prove John Hubbard's conjecture on the topological complexity of the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map. Indeed, we show that there exist several non-trivial loops in the locus which generate infinitely many mutually different monodromies. Our main tool is a rigorous computational algorithm for verifying the uniform hyperbolicity of chain recurrent sets. In addition, we show that the dynamics of the real H\'enon map is completely determined by the monodromy of a certain loop, providing the parameter of the map is contained in the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H\'enon map.
1733	This research paper presents a semiclassical theory for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing-gap fluctuations in superconductors. The primary theme is to understand the effects of thermal fluctuations on the pairing-gap structure. The analysis shows that the semiclassical approach provides a more accurate description of the pairing-gap fluctuations than the previous theories based on the Gaussian approximation. The significant finding of this research is that the semiclassical theory predicts a power-law dependence of the pairing-gap fluctuations on temperature, which was not observed in the earlier theories. The conclusion of this research is that the semiclassical theory provides a more refined and accurate description of the pairing-gap fluctuations in superconductors.
3768	This research paper explores the role of oxygen-rich droplets in enriching the interstellar medium (ISM). The main objective is to investigate the formation, dynamics, and chemical processes of these droplets and their potential contribution to the abundance of oxygen in the ISM. Using numerical simulations and observational data, the authors demonstrate that oxygen-rich droplets can form in the outflows of oxygen-rich stars, and that they can survive in the ISM for millions of years. These droplets can also trigger the formation of new stars and planets, and may have played a key role in the evolution of the early universe. The study concludes that oxygen-rich droplets are an important source of oxygen enrichment in the ISM, and that further research is needed to fully understand their impact on the chemical evolution of galaxies.
3255	The research paper explores the theory of integrable lattices and their sublattices. In particular, it focuses on the B-quadrilateral lattice and its relation to self-adjoint schemes on the triangular and honeycomb lattices. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties and symmetries of these lattices, and derives several important results concerning their integrability and the existence of special types of solutions. The main conclusion of the paper is that the B-quadrilateral lattice and its sublattices are important objects of study in the theory of integrable systems, and can be used to derive new insights into the properties of lattice models in physics and mathematics.
1524	First results of observations of the low mass X-ray binary Her X-1/HZ Her performed by the INTEGRAL satellite in July-August 2005 are presented. A significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a dynamical spin-up/spin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical observations of HZ Her are also discussed.
1250	This research paper presents a new method for classifying supersymmetric lattice gauge theories using the concept of orbifolding. The authors introduce a set of criteria that can be used to determine the symmetries and topological properties of these theories. By applying this method to a range of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, the authors are able to identify several distinct classes of theories. They also show that these classes are related to one another through a series of dualities. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the nature of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.
189	This research paper discusses the Inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata Algorithm and its application in developing small decoders for Algebraic-Geometric Codes. The algorithm is a significant improvement over the traditional Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which requires matrix inversion, and thus reduces computational complexity. The paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm and its practical implementation. The results indicate that the algorithm is effective in terms of decoding capability and computational efficiency. The proposed small decoder is also shown to be highly efficient in decoding Algebraic-Geometric Codes. Overall, this research offers a novel solution that can significantly reduce the computational complexity of decoding Algebraic-Geometric Codes.
1952	Phenomenology of the notion of an unparticle U, recently perceived by Georgi, to describe a scale invariant sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point at a higher energy scale is explored in details. Behaving like a collection of d_U (the scale dimension of the unparticle operator O_U) invisible massless particles, this unparticle can be unveiled by measurements of various energy distributions for the processes Z to fermion pair + U and e-e+ to gamma U at e-e+ colliders, as well as mono-jet production at hadron colliders. We also study the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level process and the one-loop muon anomaly.
59	We study Casimir forces on the partition in a closed box (piston) with perfect metallic boundary conditions. Related closed geometries have generated interest as candidates for a repulsive force. By using an optical path expansion we solve exactly the case of a piston with a rectangular cross section, and find that the force always attracts the partition to the nearest base. For arbitrary cross sections, we can use an expansion for the density of states to compute the force in the limit of small height to width ratios. The corrections to the force between parallel plates are found to have interesting dependence on the shape of the cross section. Finally, for temperatures in the range of experimental interest we compute finite temperature corrections to the force (again assuming perfect boundaries).
1778	This paper deals with the computation of the rank and of some integer Smith forms of a series of sparse matrices arising in algebraic K-theory. The number of non zero entries in the considered matrices ranges from 8 to 37 millions. The largest rank computation took more than 35 days on 50 processors. We report on the actual algorithms we used to build the matrices, their link to the motivic cohomology and the linear algebra and parallelizations required to perform such huge computations. In particular, these results are part of the first computation of the cohomology of the linear group GL_7(Z).
1105	We present a comparative study of CoO2 layers in the Bi-misfit and NaxCoO2 cobaltates. Co NMR measures the intrinsic susceptibility of the Co layers and is not affected by spurious contributions. At low dopings where room-temperature thermopower (TEP) is large, Curie-Weiss susceptibilities are observed in both materials. But NMR and muSR experiments find neither charge nor spin order down to low temperatures in Bi-misfit, in contrast to the case of NaxCoO2. This demonstrates that metallicity, charge and magnetic orders are specific of the Na layers in NaxCoO2 whereas strong correlations are generic of the cobaltates physics and could explain the large TEP.
843	Linear measures such as cross-correlation have been used successfully to determine time delays from the given processes. Such an analysis often precedes identifying possible causal relationships between the observed processes. The present study investigates the impact of a positively correlated driver whose correlation function decreases monotonically with lag on the delay estimation in a two-node acyclic network with one and two-delays. It is shown that cross-correlation analysis of the given processes can result in spurious identification of multiple delays between the driver and the dependent processes. Subsequently, delay estimation of increment process as opposed to the original process under certain implicit constraints is explored. Short-range and long-range correlated driver processes along with those of their coarse-grained counterparts are considered.
3041	Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems, called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium. In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type of objects will be presented.
1018	"A class of interacting classical random fields is constructed using deformed *-algebras of creation and annihilation operators. The fields constructed are classical random field versions of ""Lie fields"". A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the fields constructed are ""quantum random fields"" in the sense that they have Poincare invariant vacua with a fluctuation scale determined by Planck's constant. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle interpretation of a quantum field theory."
144	"The research paper, titled ""Quantum Theory of Successive Projective Measurements,"" explores the theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems under multiple measurements. The paper proposes a mathematical model that takes into account the non-commutativity of quantum operators and the collapse of the wave function after each measurement. The results of the study suggest that the outcome of successive measurements is highly dependent on the initial state of the system and the order in which the measurements are performed. The paper concludes that a deeper understanding of successive projective measurements is crucial for the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum communication."
3491	This research paper focuses on the multiobjective optimization of a prismatic drive. The study aims to identify the optimal combination of design parameters that would simultaneously satisfy multiple performance objectives. The proposed methodology is based on the integration of a genetic algorithm and a finite element analysis. The results show that the optimized prismatic drive design can achieve significant improvements in both its static and dynamic performance attributes. The critical outcomes of this study include a better understanding of the complex interaction between design parameters, the development of an efficient optimization methodology for prismatic drives, and the identification of the optimal design for multiobjective optimization.

1694	We investigate the competition between pairing correlations and ferromagnetism in small metallic grains in the presence of a Zeeman field. Our analysis is based on the universal Hamiltonian, valid in the limit of large Thouless conductance. We show that the coexistence regime of superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations can be made experimentally accessible by tuning an external Zeeman field. We compare the exact solution of the model with a mean-field theory and find that the latter cannot describe pairing correlations in the intermediate regime. We also study the occurrence of spin jumps across the phase boundary separating the superconducting and coexistence regimes.

3355	We demonstrate the operation of a differential single Cooper-pair box, a charge qubit consisting of two aluminum islands, isolated from ground, coupled by a pair of small-area Josephson junctions, and read out with a superconducting differential radio-frequency single electron transistor. We have tested four devices, all of which show evidence of quasiparticle poisoning. The devices are characterized with microwave spectroscopy and temperature dependence studies, and Coulomb staircases are shown to be e-periodic in all samples. However, coherent control is still possible with non-adiabatic voltage pulses. Coherent oscillation experiments and a relaxation time measurement were performed using a charge derivative readout technique.
762	"This research paper is a continuation of the study of Swan conductors for p-adic differential modules. The main objective is to investigate the global variation of these conductors under certain conditions. The authors introduce the concept of a ""good family"" of p-adic differential modules, and prove that the Swan conductor varies continuously as the family varies over a suitable base. They also give explicit formulas for the variation of the Swan conductor in some special cases. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the study of p-adic L-functions and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Overall, this research provides important insights into the behavior of Swan conductors for p-adic differential modules, and sheds light on the connections between these conductors and other important objects in arithmetic geometry."
1894	We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find an analytical expression for the Mott insulator(MI)-Superfluid(SF) transition boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex, reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum. Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than one.
1193	This research paper examines the partonic structure of hadrons through the Drell-Yan process. The Drell-Yan process is a powerful tool to investigate the partonic structure of hadrons by measuring the production of lepton pairs in high-energy proton-proton collisions.

The main objectives were to study different models of opinion formation and to investigate how the presence of opinion leaders affects the diffusion of opinions. The study found that opinion leaders can significantly impact the spread of opinions in a social network, especially when they have a large following or are perceived as trustworthy. Additionally, the research identified that the type of opinion leader and the timing of their intervention can also affect the diffusion of opinions. These findings have important implications for understanding how opinions are formed and spread in social networks, and suggest that targeted interventions by opinion leaders may be effective in shaping public opinion.

697	The manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising technique for a variety of applications ranging from laser cooling and trapping to coherent atom transport and matter wave interferometry. Optical fields have also been proposed as interesting tools for quantum information processing with cold atoms. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a cold 87Rb atomic cloud falling in the gravity field in the presence of two crossing dipole guides. The cloud is either deflected or split between the two branches of this guide. We explore the possibilities of optimization of this device and present preliminary results obtained in the case of zero-temperature dilute Bose-Einstein condensates.
2710	We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural scaling model.
102	Abstract: Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a sender to send one out of two messages to a receiver without revealing which message was sent. Key exchange is another essential cryptographic primitive that enables two parties to establish a shared secret key for secure communication. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for oblivious transfer based on key exchange. Our protocol achieves the same security properties as traditional OT protocols while leveraging the efficiency and simplicity of key exchange protocols. We provide a detailed security analysis and implementation of our protocol, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency. Our results suggest that our protocol can be a viable alternative to traditional OT protocols in scenarios where key exchange is already being used.

The study focuses on analyzing the chemical composition of these galaxies and comparing them with the current understanding of stellar evolution and galaxy formation. The results indicate that the metal-poor galaxies are indeed young, with the majority of them being less than 1 billion years old. This conclusion challenges some previous assumptions and understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, suggesting that metal-poor galaxies may be a unique and important population to study further. The research also highlights the need for future observations and studies to better understand the formation and evolution of these intriguing galaxies.
969	"The research paper titled ""Random walks of Wilson loops in the screening regime"" explores the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime using random walk models. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the dynamics of Wilson loops in the presence of heavy screening. The researchers found that the screening effect leads to a decrease in the typical size of the Wilson loops. They also observed that the distribution of Wilson loops becomes more Gaussian as the screening becomes stronger. The study concludes that random walk models can be used to understand the behavior of Wilson loops in the screening regime."
2405	This research paper presents multi-wavelength observations of Southern Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs) using ammonia and 24 GHz continuum data, with a focus on the methanol masers that trace these HMCs. The study found that the ammonia emission is coincident with the methanol masers, indicating that ammonia can be used as a reliable tracer of HMCs. The continuum emission at 24 GHz was also detected in the HMCs, which suggests that the continuum emission can be used to identify HMCs in future surveys. Overall, this study provides important insights into the properties and characteristics of HMCs in the Southern hemisphere.
3451	Fermi, Pasta and Ulam observed, that the excitation of a low frequency normal mode in a nonlinear acoustic chain leads to localization in normal mode space on large time scales. Fast equipartition (and thus complete delocalization) in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain is restored if relevant intensive control parameters exceed certain threshold values. We compare recent results on periodic orbits (in the localization regime) and resonant normal forms (in a weak delocalization regime), and relate them to various resonance overlap criteria. We show that the approaches quantitatively agree in their estimate of the localization-delocalization threshold. A key ingredient for this transition are resonances of overtones.
1994	This research paper explores the linkage between accretion disks and blazars, focusing on the primary theme of understanding the emission mechanisms of these astrophysical objects. The study utilized multi-wavelength observations and numerical simulations to investigate the physical processes involved in the accretion disk and jet formation, as well as the mechanisms that contribute to the observed variability in blazar emission. The findings suggest that the accretion disk plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of blazars, and that the jet launch and collimation are intimately linked to the disk structure and dynamics. The study highlights the importance of a comprehensive understanding of accretion disk physics for interpreting the observations of blazars and other active galactic nuclei.
3933	This research paper explores the application of general asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations to phase transitions in quantum gravity. The authors use the concept of critical exponents to identify the behavior of the system near a phase transition. They propose a method to calculate the critical exponents based on the asymptotic behavior of the metric tensor near the transition point. The authors also introduce a new class of asymptotic solutions, called the critical solutions, which exhibit the same scaling behavior as the system near a phase transition. They demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by analyzing a simple example of a black hole in anti-de Sitter space. The paper concludes that the general asymptotic solutions can provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum gravity near phase transitions.
1649	To synthesize a new superconductor which has a critical temperature, Tc, exceeding the room temperature, one needs to know what chemical components to start with. This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one to draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential room-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room temperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and atoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion is fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any assumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This, however, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is an easy task.
2800	This research paper focuses on the development of an information-based traffic control system for public conveyance systems such as buses and trains. The objective is to reduce clustering and enhance the efficiency of these systems by providing real-time information to passengers and drivers. The proposed system utilizes various data sources such as GPS tracking, passenger counts, and traffic flow data to predict and manage congestion.

The results show a significant reduction in clustering and improved efficiency, leading to a more comfortable and reliable public transportation experience. The information-based traffic control system has the potential to revolutionize public conveyance systems and improve the quality of life for urban commuters.

1982	The objective of this research paper was to investigate the transport properties of graphene across a tunable potential barrier. The study was conducted by fabricating a graphene p-n junction device and applying a gate voltage to manipulate the potential barrier. The main findings of the study showed that the transmission probability across the barrier was highly dependent on the height and width of the barrier, as well as the energy of the incoming electrons. Additionally, the researchers observed that the conductance of the device exhibited a characteristic peak as the potential barrier was tuned, which can be attributed to resonant tunneling of electrons through the barrier. Overall, the research highlights the potential of graphene p-n junction devices as tunable barriers for controlling electron transport in nanoelectronics applications.
1183	This research paper investigates the entanglement and topological entropy of the toric code at finite temperature. The toric code is a topologically ordered quantum spin system that is highly entangled, making it a promising candidate for quantum error correction. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the entanglement properties and topological entropy of the toric code at finite temperature. The results show that the entanglement entropy increases with temperature, while the topological entropy remains constant. The study also demonstrates that topological entropy can be used as a measure of the stability of the topological order. These findings have important implications for the development of quantum error correction codes and the understanding of topologically ordered systems.
26	This research paper explores the impact of growth parameters on the structural properties and bandgap of InN epilayers deposited using a showerhead MOVPE system. InN epilayers were grown under various growth conditions, including temperature, pressure, and V/III ratio. The structural properties of the grown InN epilayers were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The bandgap of the InN epilayers was measured using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the growth parameters significantly influence the structural properties and bandgap of InN epilayers. The optimal growth conditions for high-quality InN epilayers were found to be a growth temperature of 550  C, a pressure of 200 mbar, and a V/III ratio of 400. This study provides valuable insights into the growth of InN epilayers and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
3034	This research paper investigates the performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in multihop networks with opportunistic relay selection. The primary focus is to analyze the impact of various parameters, such as number of relays, channel conditions, and power allocations, on the throughput and delay of the HARQ scheme. The paper also proposes a novel relay selection algorithm that improves the system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of throughput and delay, and the optimal number of relays and power allocation can vary depending on the channel conditions. The study concludes that HARQ with opportunistic relay selection is a promising solution for improving the performance of multihop networks.
2855	Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.
639	We introduce a distributed algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor networks. Our algorithm assumes that nodes in the network only know their immediate neighborhoods and an upper bound on the network's diameter. Clock-synchronization messages are only sent as part of the communication, assumed reasonably frequent, that already takes place among nodes. The algorithm has the gradient property of [2], achieving an O(1) worst-case skew between the logical clocks of neighbors. As in the case of [3,8], the algorithm's actions are such that no constant lower bound exists on the rate at which logical clocks progress in time, and for this reason the lower bound of [2,5] that forbids constant skew between neighbors does not apply.
1109	Face recognition is a widely researched topic, with neural networks (NNs) being one of the most effective methods for this task. In this paper, we compare the robustness of pairwise and multiclass NNs for face recognition. We evaluate the performance of both types of NNs on a large dataset of faces and compare their accuracy under various conditions, including changes in lighting, pose, and expression. Our results show that multiclass NNs outperform pairwise NNs in terms of accuracy and robustness, especially under challenging conditions. Furthermore, we find that multiclass NNs are more efficient in terms of memory and processing time, making them a better choice for real-time face recognition systems. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate and reliable face recognition systems using NNs.
2796	"The research paper titled ""Green function theory versus Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for thin magnetic films"" compares two different methods for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. The main subject of the paper is to determine which method is more accurate and efficient for this type of calculation. The key finding of the paper is that both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but overall, the Quantum Monte Carlo method is more accurate for calculating the magnetic properties of thin films. However, the Green function theory method is still useful for providing insight into the underlying physics of the system. The paper concludes that both methods should be used in conjunction with each other for a more complete understanding of the magnetic properties of thin films."
1500	We consider the stability of a porous medium submitted to a steady-state flow with free-boundary. Assuming some hypotheses, it is possible to implement the kinematic method by using an approximate pressure field bounding the true pressure field from below. We are interested in finding such approximate pressure fields and in proving that they bound the true pressure field from below without knowing the true pressure field. We use fields which are solutions of a problem with relaxed conditions with regard to the real problem. Under a uniqueness condition of the solution of a weak formulation of the problem, such fields are lower bounds for the true pressure field. Finally, we give the example of a vertical dam.
2049	Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we find a reasonable agreement.
1064	This research paper presents a new algorithm for enumerating maximally clustered permutations, which are permutations that have the maximum number of monotone subsequences. The algorithm is based on a recursive decomposition of permutations into simpler structures, and it has a time complexity of O(n^4) and a space complexity of O(n^3). The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm and its properties, including a proof that it generates all maximally clustered permutations. The algorithm is implemented in a computer program, and experiments show that it is efficient and scalable for large values of n. The paper concludes by discussing some applications of maximally clustered permutations in various fields of mathematics and computer science.
358	We introduce a new model for the dynamics of a wormlike chain in an environment that gives rise to a rough free energy landscape, which we baptise the glassy wormlike chain. It is obtained from the common wormlike chain by an exponential stretching of the relaxation spectrum of its long-wavelength eigenmodes, controlled by a single stretching parameter. Predictions for pertinent observables such as the dynamic structure factor and the microrheological susceptibility exhibit the characteristics of soft glassy rheology and compare favourably with experimental data for reconstituted cytoskeletal networks and live cells. We speculate about the possible microscopic origin of the stretching, implications for the nonlinear rheology, and the potential physiological significance of our results.
2910	The Mathematical Universe is a concept that suggests that mathematics is not just a human invention, but a fundamental aspect of the universe itself. This paper explores the idea that the universe is inherently mathematical, and that all physical phenomena can be explained through mathematical laws and principles. Through an analysis of various theories and observations, it is concluded that mathematics is indeed a universal language that can describe the fundamental nature of the universe. The implications of this idea are far-reaching, as it suggests that mathematics can be used to predict and understand phenomena that were previously thought to be beyond our comprehension. Ultimately, this paper argues that the Mathematical Universe is a powerful and compelling idea that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.
3843	I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.
D2-33	Computational systems biology is an emerging field in biological simulation that attempts to model or simulate intra- and intercellular events using data gathered from genomic, proteomic or metabolomic experiments. The need to model complex temporal and spatiotemporal processes at many different scales has led to the emergence of numerous techniques, including systems of differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata simulators, agent-based models and pi calculus. This review provides a brief summary and an assessment of most of these approaches. It also provides examples of how these methods are being used to facilitate drug discovery and development. Systems biology is a newly emerging, multi-disciplinary field that studies the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes by treating these processes as integrated systems.
D2-23	Diabetes type 1 and type 2 are both chronic conditions affecting blood sugar regulation but have different causes and mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance, where the body still produces insulin but cannot use it effectively. It is more common in adults and is strongly linked to obesity, diet, and lifestyle factors. Type 2 can often be managed with diet, exercise, and medication, while type 1 requires insulin replacement. Both types require careful blood sugar management to prevent complications.
3633	The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator.
3897	"""The World as Evolving Information"" is a research paper that explores the idea of the world as a complex system of evolving information. The paper argues that all things, from physical objects to human behavior, can be understood as information that is constantly changing and evolving. The paper also discusses the implications of this perspective for our understanding of reality and the challenges that arise from attempting to model and predict the behavior of complex systems. The significant findings of this paper include the idea that information is a fundamental aspect of the universe and that a deeper understanding of information can lead to new insights into the nature of reality. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of new tools and methods for studying complex systems as evolving information."
5	This research paper investigates the percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation, which refers to the relationship between the degrees of the nodes in a network. The authors use numerical simulations to study the behavior of percolation on networks with varying degrees of correlation. The results show that degree-degree correlation can significantly affect the percolation transition, and that networks with positive correlation tend to have a higher percolation threshold than those with negative correlation. The research has important implications for understanding the resilience of real-world networks, such as social networks and transportation networks, to failures and attacks.
1804	This research paper explores the relationship between two measures of complexity in formal language theory: bounded pushdown dimension (BPD) and Lempel-Ziv information density (LZID). BPD is a measure of the amount of memory required to recognize a language, while LZID measures the amount of compression that can be achieved for a given language. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that BPD and LZID are highly correlated for a range of languages, suggesting that they capture similar aspects of language complexity. Moreover, we show that these measures can be used to distinguish between different classes of languages and to predict the performance of various parsing algorithms. Our findings have important implications for the design and optimization of natural language processing systems.
2873	This research paper presents a study on the behavior of continuous interfaces in the presence of disorder, focusing on the two-dimensional case. The authors investigate the effectiveness of strong pinning, a mechanism that is commonly used to stabilize such interfaces, and find that it is not sufficient in this context. They demonstrate this through numerical simulations of the interface motion, as well as analytical calculations of the critical pinning strength required for stabilization. The results suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between disorder and pinning is needed in order to fully understand the behavior of continuous interfaces in real-world systems.
2594	The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson, becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode. The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.
3744	"The research paper titled ""Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts"" investigates the behavior of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs) in a two-dimensional electron gas. The main theme of the paper is the study of counterflow, where electrons are injected from opposite sides of the QPCs and flow in opposite directions. The authors report that when the QPCs are close together, the counterflow of electrons is suppressed due to the Coulomb interaction between them. However, when the QPCs are separated by a distance larger than the electron wavelength, the counterflow becomes dominant. The paper concludes that the behavior of electrons in QPCs is highly dependent on their distance and Coulomb interaction, and these findings could have implications for the development of new electronic devices."
2993	"The research paper titled ""Finite bias visibility of the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer"" focuses on studying the visibility of electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) at finite biases. MZIs are used in quantum computing to manipulate and control the state of qubits. The paper presents a theoretical study of the visibility of these MZIs and how it changes with the applied bias voltage. The researchers found that the visibility of the MZI decreases as the bias voltage increases, which can lead to errors in quantum operations. They also demonstrated that the visibility can be controlled and improved by adjusting the phase of the MZI. The paper concludes that understanding the visibility of MZIs at finite biases is crucial for the development of reliable quantum computing devices."
80	"The paper ""Thermal noise informatics"" explores the potential of using thermal noise to achieve secure communication through a wire, zero-power communication, and thermal noise driven computing. The authors present a theoretical framework for understanding the properties of thermal noise and its potential applications in information processing. They demonstrate the feasibility of using thermal noise as a source of randomness for encryption and decryption of messages, as well as for powering low-energy devices. The authors also discuss the potential of thermal noise as a computational resource, offering promising results in simulations of simple logic gates. Overall, the paper suggests that thermal noise has significant potential for advancing the field of information processing and communication."
1328	Many index theorems (both classical and in noncommutative geometry) can be interpreted in terms of a Lie groupoid acting properly on a manifold and leaving an elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators invariant. Alain Connes in his book raised the question of an index theorem in this general context. In this paper, an analytic index for many such situations is constructed. The approach is inspired by the classical families theorem of Atiyah and Singer, and the proof generalizes, to the case of proper Lie groupoid actions, some of the results proved for proper locally compact group actions by N. C. Phillips.
352	This research paper investigates the conserved charges of spacetimes in both asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter spaces in arbitrary dimensions. The study focuses on the behavior of the charges under diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. The authors develop a new method for computing the charges that is applicable in any dimension and prove that it is equivalent to the standard method used in four dimensions. They also explore the properties of the charges and their relation to symmetries of the spacetimes. This paper provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of conserved charges in higher-dimensional spacetimes and their applications in the study of gravity and gauge theories.
2215	This research paper explores the characteristics of gaseous inner disks in young stellar objects. Using observational data and numerical simulations, the authors investigate the physical processes that govern the evolution of these disks. They find that the presence of a magnetic field can significantly affect the dynamics and accretion rates of the gas, leading to the formation of spiral structures and the opening of gaps in the disk. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between magnetic fields, gas dynamics, and gravitational forces in shaping the structure and evolution of gaseous inner disks.
3060	The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and repulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.
3834	"The paper ""Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry"" presents a new approach to solving algebraic geometry problems using saturated and positive integer programming. The authors introduce the concept of a ""flip"" in algebraic geometry and propose a method for computing flips using these techniques. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to several examples in representation theory, including the computation of the Gromov-Witten invariants for the Grassmannian variety. The paper concludes by discussing the potential implications of this work for the field of algebraic geometry and its applications in other areas of mathematics."
1846	This research paper focuses on the observations and modeling of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares. The study utilizes high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate the spectral line shapes of flares and to determine the physical properties of the plasma involved. Through the analysis of these observations, the research reveals that the asymmetries in the spectral lines are primarily caused by the Doppler shifts of material moving toward or away from the observer. Furthermore, the paper presents a new flare model that successfully reproduces the line asymmetries observed in the data. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of chromospheric flares and provide a valuable tool for future observations and modeling efforts.
1435	This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for them actively.
1606	Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T Tauri Stars (TTS) are still not well understood. Important new insight came recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a unique 10-day long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST). Based mainly on the results of these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.
482	This research paper investigates the behavior of ion condensation on charged patterned surfaces, which has significant implications for various fields including materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the surface pattern geometry significantly affects ion condensation, resulting in different ion distributions and charge screening behaviors. Our findings suggest that the ability to control the pattern geometry can provide a powerful tool for tuning ion condensation and charge screening properties on patterned surfaces. Additionally, we show that the ion condensation behavior is also affected by the ion concentration, surface charge density, and temperature. These results have relevant implications for designing surfaces with tailored ion transport properties and for understanding the behavior of biological membranes and ion channels.

The main objective of the study is to understand the behavior of the superconductor under the influence of a magnetic field and to determine the factors that affect its relaxation. The experiment involves applying pulsed magnetic fields with varying strengths to the superconductor and measuring its relaxation time. The study reveals that the relaxation time of the superconductor is affected by the strength of the magnetic field and the temperature of the sample. The results also suggest that the relaxation time of the superconductor can be used as an indicator of its superconducting properties. The study has important implications for the development of high-temperature superconductors for practical applications in various fields.
958	Web page ranking and collaborative filtering require the optimization of sophisticated performance measures. Current Support Vector approaches are unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem, which can be solved by the Hungarian Marriage algorithm. At test time, a sort operation is sufficient, as our algorithm assigns a relevance score to every (document, query) pair. Experiments show that the our algorithm is fast and that it works very well.
1850	This research paper investigates the connection between black holes and large order quantum geometry. Through mathematical analysis and simulations, the study reveals that the geometry of black holes aligns with the principles of large order quantum geometry, providing a new perspective on the nature of black holes. The findings suggest that black holes may be understood as manifestations of quantum geometry and that the study of large order quantum geometry could provide insights into the behavior of black holes. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing effort to deepen our understanding of the complex and mysterious nature of black holes.
3817	"We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product."
2938	The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters, namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient. Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted graphs.
3174	Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.
3617	This research paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of subthreshold oscillatory behaviors in nonlinear autonomous systems. The authors investigate the conditions under which such oscillations can occur and the relationship between the system's parameters and the characteristics of the oscillations. They also explore the dynamics of the system near the onset of oscillations and demonstrate that the system's response to perturbations can change significantly as it approaches the oscillation threshold. The authors conclude that their analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of nonlinear autonomous systems, which can be useful in a wide range of applications, from neuroscience to electronics.
2673	The Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface structure has been studied using a combination of quantitative LEED I-V and ab initio methods. The study focused on the missing half-order spots in the 3x1 diffraction pattern. The results showed that the surface reconstruction is caused by the formation of a Sm-Si dimer row, which creates a new surface unit cell. The missing half-order spots are explained by a symmetry reduction due to the formation of the Sm-Si dimers. The study provides a detailed understanding of the surface structure and the origin of the missing half-order spots, which has important implications for the development of semiconductor devices.
717	The melanin is a group of biological pigments commonly found in living beings, it can be classified in three groups: eumelanin human beings, pheomelanins in animals, and allomelanins in the vegetal kingdom. There is a special interest in the eumelanin because this biopolymer exhibits the typical properties of a semiconductor. Eumelanin is also responsible of the main cellular photoprotection mechanisms in the human beings. The exact structural pattern of eumelanin is not completely known yet, the planar molecules 5, 6-indolquinine and its reduced forms semiquinone and hydroquinone outline the greater part of the biological pigment. In this work the structural, electronic and optical properties of monomers in various charged states (0, -1) and dimmers of eumelanin in vacuum, are found for the neutral state of charge, by means of the Semiempirical methods MNDO, AM1, PM3 and ZINDO/S-CI
534	The article discusses the circular motion of two particles with unequal masses in the context of post-Minkowski approximation. The study uses the Hamiltonian formalism to derive the equations of motion and obtain solutions for the system. The main focus is on analyzing the effects of post-Minkowski corrections on the circular orbits of the particles. The study finds that the post-Minkowski corrections have a significant impact on the motion of the particles, altering their orbital parameters such as the radius and frequency. The authors conclude that the post-Minkowski corrections must be taken into account when analyzing the motion of particles in circular orbits, particularly in the context of high-precision experiments or astrophysical scenarios.
448	This research paper presents a detailed investigation of the X-ray source IGR J16194-2810, which was detected by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). The aim of this study is to determine whether IGR J16194-2810 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary, a type of binary star system in which a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, accretes material from a companion star. We analyze the X-ray and optical properties of IGR J16194-2810 using data from various telescopes, including XMM-Newton and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Our results suggest that IGR J16194-2810 is indeed a symbiotic X-ray binary, with a red giant star as its companion. The implications of this discovery for our understanding of the formation and evolution of binary star systems are discussed.
2253	"The research paper titled ""Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations"" explores the relationship between protein mutational robustness and population size in evolutionary processes. The main focus of the study is to determine whether larger populations have a higher rate of mutations in proteins that confer increased robustness. The key findings suggest that larger populations have a higher rate of mutations that increase protein robustness, indicating that evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large populations. The study suggests that this phenomenon is due to the increased opportunity for beneficial mutations to spread and become fixed in larger populations. The conclusions of the paper highlight the importance of population size in evolutionary processes and the potential for mutational robustness to play a significant role in the adaptation of proteins to changing environments."
3559	This research paper examines the concept of universal derived equivalences of posets, which involves constructing and analyzing certain categories of posets.

Specifically, the paper demonstrates how certain properties of posets can be used to construct universal derived equivalences, and explores the implications of these equivalences for various fields of mathematics. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the structure and behavior of posets, and sheds new light on the fundamental principles of derived equivalences.
2920	The research paper presents a multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched dry DNA. The study focuses on the electronic properties of DNA when it is subjected to mechanical stress, such as stretching. The findings suggest that stretching causes a significant increase in the localization of electronic states, leading to a decrease in conductivity. The study also reveals that the degree of localization is highly dependent on the stretch direction and magnitude, as well as the DNA sequence and structure. The multiscale model provides a comprehensive understanding of electronic properties of DNA under mechanical stress and can contribute to the design of new DNA-based electronic devices.
1544	We prove that the open topological string partition function on a D-brane configuration in a Calabi-Yau manifold X takes the form of a closed topological string partition function on a different Calabi-Yau manifold X_b. This identification shows that the physics of D-branes in an arbitrary background X of topological string theory can be described either by open+closed string theory in X or by closed string theory in X_b. The physical interpretation of the ''bubbling'' Calabi-Yau X_b is as the space obtained by letting the D-branes in X undergo a geometric transition. This implies, in particular, that the partition function of closed topological string theory on certain bubbling Calabi-Yau manifolds are invariants of knots in the three-sphere.
2152	Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.
1808	Shear zone formation is investigated in slow 3D shear flows. We simulate the linear version of the split-bottom shear cell. It is shown that the same type of wide shear zones is achieved in the presence as well as in the absence of gravity. We investigate the relaxation of the material towards a stationary flow and analyze the stress and the velocity fields. We provide the functional form of the widening of the shear zone inside the bulk. We discuss the growth of the region where the material is in critical state. It is found that the growth of the critical zone is responsible for the initial transient of the shear zone.
3747	In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
3882	This research paper investigates the specific heat and bimodality phenomena in the canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model. The study aims to provide insights into the behavior of the thermodynamic system in different canonical ensembles and to establish a connection between the thermodynamic properties and the system's physical characteristics. The research utilizes numerical simulations to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of a model system. The critical outcomes of the study reveal that the specific heat and bimodality behavior of the system are highly dependent on the ensemble and the system's properties. The research concludes that the canonical and grand canonical versions of the thermodynamic model provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and can be used to predict the thermodynamic properties of complex systems.

The results show that the Heisenberg limit can be reached by optimizing the interferometric sequence and reducing the shot noise. The study also highlights the importance of using squeezed states to achieve the ultimate sensitivity. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the development of atomic sensors with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity.

We also demonstrate that these solutions can be used to describe a variety of physical phenomena, including the behavior of black holes and the dynamics of cosmological models. Overall, our results suggest that Generalized Nariai Solutions for Yang-type Monopoles are a promising area of investigation in the field of theoretical physics.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of this method for various fields, including finance, healthcare, and economics. Overall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of statistical analysis and offers a practical solution to the problem of crossing in quantile and probability curves.
3870	In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.
2684	We consider the regions of the MSSM parameter space where the top squarks become light and even may be the LSP. This happens when the triple scalar coupling A becomes very big compared to m_0. We show that in this case the requirement that the LSP is neutral imposes noticeable constraint on the parameter space excluding low m_0 and m_{1/2} similar to constraint from the Higgs mass limit. In some cases these constraints overlap. This picture takes place in a wide region of \tan\beta. In a narrow band close to the border line the stops are long-lived particles and decay into quarks and neutralino (chargino). The cross-section of their production at LHC via gluon fusion mechanism in this region may reach a few pb.
3493	This research paper presents an environment-dependent charge potential (EDCP) model for water that considers the influence of the surrounding environment on the charge distribution of water molecules. The EDCP model is based on a polarizable force field and takes into account the electrostatic polarization and dispersion interactions between water molecules and their surroundings. The EDCP model was found to accurately predict the properties of water in different environments, such as bulk water, ice, and water near a charged surface. The results suggest that the EDCP model can provide a more accurate description of water behavior in various environments and could potentially lead to the development of more efficient computational models for studying complex systems involving water.
83	We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic factors, such as country wealth and foreign investment per capita, which are characterized by a power law spanning multiple scales of wealth and investments per capita. These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable over different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between level of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for two independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption. The functional relations we report have implications when assessing the relative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for quantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign investments.
D1-13	Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e., law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions (i.e., the law of constant composition), the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions. In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor transmute one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.
89	A Brownian time process is a Markov process subordinated to the absolute value of an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion. Its transition densities solve an initial value problem involving the square of the generator of the original Markov process. An apparently unrelated class of processes, emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an extension that involves fractional derivatives in time. In this paper, we will show a close and unexpected connection between these two classes of processes, and consequently, an equivalence between these two families of partial differential equations.

The results suggest that this approach could be used to optimize the performance of biological systems, particularly in the context of energy harvesting and sensing applications. Overall, this research highlights the potential of photonic engineering as a powerful tool for controlling and manipulating biological processes at the nanoscale.
293	The method for determination of the Supernovae (SNe) explosions frequency distribution function based on the assumption of explosions independence are offered. The method is based on assumption that the sequence of SNe explosions in an individual galaxy is a Poisson sequence. The essence of the method is in the determination of statistical moments of the frequency of the SNe explosions and subsequent determination of distribution function . The program of numerical simulation has been developed for testing the efficiency of the method. Numerical simulations show that even for a small mean number of registered SNe explosions, method allows restoring initial distribution function. The results of numerical simulations are given.
2381	This research paper focuses on the bound state calculations of the three-dimensional Yakubovsky equations with the inclusion of three-body forces. The Yakubovsky equations are widely used in nuclear physics to study the interactions between three or more nucleons. The inclusion of three-body forces is necessary to accurately model the behavior of nucleons in a system. In this study, we employ a numerical approach to solve the Yakubovsky equations with and without three-body forces. Our results show that the inclusion of three-body forces significantly affects the energy levels and wave functions of the system. We also compare our results with experimental data and other theoretical models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of nucleons in a three-body system and can contribute to the development of more accurate models in nuclear physics.

They compare the results with traditional inversion methods and find that their approach provides more accurate and reliable estimates of the chromospheric properties. Furthermore, they demonstrate the potential of this technique for future studies of the solar atmosphere and its dynamics. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of developing new inversion techniques to improve our understanding of the complex and dynamic solar atmosphere.
1201	Abstract:Triangulations of projective modules have been a subject of interest in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of triangulations of projective modules over a commutative ring. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of triangulations, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a projective module to admit a triangulation. We also explore the relationship between triangulations of projective modules and tilting modules, and give examples of how triangulations can be used to study representation theory. Finally, we discuss applications of triangulations in algebraic geometry, including the construction of moduli spaces and the study of the derived category of coherent sheaves. Our results have implications for a wide range of topics in mathematics, including algebraic topology, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry.

The study uses a combination of theoretical analysis and computational experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced negative type. The results show that the enhanced negative type leads to a more precise characterization of the metric structure of trees, and can be used to improve algorithms in various applications. Overall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of metric geometry and offers insights for further investigations into the structure of finite metric trees.
1616	Electronic properties of bilayer and multilayer graphene have generally been interpreted in terms of AB or Bernal stacking. However, it is known that many types of stacking defects can occur in natural and synthetic graphite; rotation of the top layer is often seen in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of graphite. In this paper we consider a graphene bilayer with a relative small angle rotation between the layers and calculate the electronic structure near zero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a AB stacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find: (a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermi velocity can be significantly smaller than the single layer value; (b) an external electric field, perpendicular to the layers, does not open an electronic gap
1679	In this research paper, the authors investigate the zero-energy states and fragmentation of spin in the easy-plane antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice. They use the Schwinger boson mean-field theory to analyze the ground state properties of the system and find that it exhibits a rich variety of zero-energy states. They also study the fragmentation of spin and find that it is sensitive to the anisotropy of the spin interactions. The authors conclude that the zero-energy states and fragmentation of spin in the easy-plane antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice are important factors that need to be considered when studying the properties of such systems.

1748	A consistent device model to describe current-voltage characteristics of metal/insulator/metal systems is developed. In this model the insulator and the metal electrodes are described within the same theoretical framework by using density of states distributions. This approach leads to differential equations for the electric field which have to be solved in a self consistent manner by considering the continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical potential in the complete system. The model is capable of describing the current-voltage characteristics of the metal/insulator/metal system in forward and reverse bias for arbitrary values of the metal/ insulator injection barriers. In the case of high injection barriers, approximations are provided offering a tool for comparison with experiments. Numerical calculations are performed exemplary using a simplified model of an organic semiconductor.

The results show that the scheme is able to accurately predict the radiation flux and energy deposition in the media. Additionally, the scheme is found to be efficient in terms of computational time and memory usage. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the finite volume-finite element scheme in modeling nuclear transport phenomena.
3048	Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.

These include the successful imaging of ultracold atoms on a surface, the ability to manipulate individual atoms with the STM tip, and the observation of collective behavior of atoms in the ensemble. The paper highlights the potential of STM for advancing our understanding of ultracold atoms and their applications in fields such as quantum computing and simulation."

The authors also derive explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions near the threshold. These findings have important implications for the design and optimization of networks of thin fibers, such as those used in material science and engineering.
1462	This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier. Using the virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier, the output of the magnetoelectric measurement system is extensively rich in magnetoelectric coupling behaviors, including coupling strength and phase lag, under various dc bias magnetic field and ac magnetic field.
3484	We consider a network of nodes distributed in physical space without physical links communicating through message broadcasting over specified distances. Typically, communication using smaller distances is desirable due to savings in energy or other resources. We introduce a network formation mechanism to enable reducing the distances while retaining connectivity. Nodes, which initially transmit signals at a prespecified maximum distance, subject links to preferential detachment by autonomously decreasing their transmission radii while satisfying conditions of zero communication loss and fixed maximum node-hopping distance for signaling. Applied to networks with various spatial topologies, we find cost reductions as high as 90% over networks that are restricted to have all nodes with equal transmission distance.
3117	Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables. This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models. Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

425	A scheme for coherent manipulation of collective atomic states is developed such that total subradiant states, in which spontaneous emission is suppressed into all directions due to destructive interference between neighbor atoms, can be created in an extended atomic ensemble. The optimal conditions for creation of such states and suitability of them for quantum storage are discussed. It is shown that in order to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio the shape of a light pulse to be stored and reconstructed using a homogeneously broadened absorbtion line of an atomic system should be a time-reversed regular part of the response function of the system. In the limit of high optical density, such pulses allow one to prepare collective subradiant atomic states with near flat spatial distribution of the atomic excitation in the medium.

The proposed method is compared with other reconstruction methods and is found to have better performance in terms of accuracy and resolution. The study also shows that the method is robust and can handle high levels of background noise. The outcomes of the study suggest that the Gauss convoluted Pandel PDF can be a useful tool for track reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes, leading to improved neutrino detection and identification.
366	In magnetic systems with dominating easy-plane anisotropy the magnetization can be described by an effective one dimensional equation for the in-plane angle. Re-deriving this equation in the presence of spin-transfer torques, we obtain a description that allows for a more intuitive understanding of spintronic devices' operation and can serve as a tool for finding new dynamic regimes. A surprising prediction is obtained for a planar ``spin-flip transistor'': an unstable equilibrium point can be stabilized by a current induced torque that further repels the system from that point. Stabilization by repulsion happens due to the presence of dissipative environment and requires a Gilbert damping constant that is large enough to ensure overdamped dynamics at zero current.

D1-26	"The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a ""soup"" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life."

We propose that this stratification is due to the gravitational influence of the binary stars on the dust particles. Our findings shed new light on the complex dynamics of circumbinary disks and have important implications for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems.

803	Events with observed D* and/or muons in the final state were used to indicate the presence of beauty quark production and to study the correlations between the particles coming from the same or different B-hadrons. The Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) theoretical predictions for such processes were often available only at parton level. A method to calculate visible level cross sections at NLO, based on an interface of the FMNR program to PYTHIA 6.2, is applied. It uses the NLO description at b-quark level provided by FMNR applying a statistical reduction procedure (REDSTAT) that allows the link to PYTHIA, from where the description of the B-hadron decay chain is obtained. Comparisons of the data and NLO cross sections at visible and b-quark level were found to be consistent and equivalent.

We derived a symmetrical convection diffusion equation for each component as well as the Navier Stokes equation and continuity equation for the overall system. The algorithm was verified through simulations of binary and ternary systems. The equilibrium concentrations of components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree well with theoretical expectations.

D1-4	A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It has no mass, no electric charge, and always moves at the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum). Photons carry energy and momentum, which depend on their wavelength or frequency. Higher frequency photons (like X-rays) have more energy, while lower frequency photons (like radio waves) have less. Their energy is given by Planck’s equation:E = h f, where E is energy, h is Planck’s constant, and f is frequency.Photons behave as both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), meaning they can interfere, diffract, and be absorbed/emitted like particles. They are responsible for vision, photosynthesis, solar power, and many quantum phenomena.
2234	Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories.

D1-6	The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth’s lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These movements shape the planet, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. The theory builds on continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, and is supported by evidence from seafloor spreading, fossil distribution, and geological formations. Plates move apart at divergent boundaries, collide at convergent boundaries, and slide past each other at transform boundaries. Their movement is driven by mantle convection, gravity, and Earth’s rotation, constantly reshaping the surface. This theory is essential for understanding natural disasters and the geological evolution of continents.
212	There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the issue of whether it is possible for a single photon to exhibit nonlocality. A number of schemes have been proposed that claim to demonstrate this effect, but each has been met with significant opposition. The objections hinge largely on the fact that these schemes use unobservable initial states and so, it is claimed, they do not represent experiments that could actually be performed. Here we show how it is possible to overcome these objections by presenting an experimentally feasible scheme that uses realistic initial states. Furthermore, all the techniques required for photons are equally applicable to atoms. It should, therefore, also be possible to use this scheme to verify the nonlocality of a single massive particle.
2727	The search for a universal entangler has been a topic of great interest in the field of quantum computing.

Through a thorough analysis of various entangling operations, we demonstrate the existence of a specific entangler that can be used to generate entangled states with high fidelity. Furthermore, we provide a proof of the universality of this entangler, showing that it can be used to generate any entangled state with arbitrary precision. Our findings have significant implications for the development of quantum computing technologies, as the ability to efficiently generate highly entangled states is critical for many quantum algorithms.
912	Consider a collection of random variables attached to the vertices of a graph. The reconstruction problem requires to estimate one of them given `far away' observations. Several theoretical results (and simple algorithms) are available when their joint probability distribution is Markov with respect to a tree. In this paper we consider the case of sequences of random graphs that converge locally to trees. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for the tree and graph reconstruction problem to coincide. We apply such condition to colorings of random graphs. Further, we characterize the behavior of Ising models on such graphs, both with attractive and random interactions (respectively, `ferromagnetic' and `spin glass').
225	Sr2CrOsO6 is a complex oxide with a unique electronic structure that results in a spin polarized metal-insulator transition.

Our results suggest that the spin polarized metal-insulator transition in this material is indeed driven by 5d band filling. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the development of new materials with similar electronic properties. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental physics behind the spin polarized metal-insulator transition in Sr2CrOsO6 and provides insights into the design of novel electronic materials.
D2-21	The probability of extraterrestrial life existing remains one of science's great unknowns, with estimates varying widely based on different assumptions and models. While we lack direct evidence of life beyond Earth, several scientific factors inform our understanding: The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy by multiplying several probability factors. However, many of these factors remain highly uncertain. Many astrobiologists consider microbial life likely to exist elsewhere, with estimates ranging from cautious to highly optimistic. The probability of intelligent civilizations remains more speculative, with the Fermi Paradox (questioning why we haven't detected them) suggesting either rarity or communication difficulties.
904	Link homotopy has been an active area of research for knot theorists since its introduction by Milnor in the 1950s. We introduce a new equivalence relation on spatial graphs called component homotopy, which reduces to link homotopy in the classical case. Unlike previous attempts at generalizing link homotopy to spatial graphs, our new relation allows analogues of some standard link homotopy results and invariants. In particular we can define a type of Milnor group for a spatial graph under component homotopy, and this group determines whether or not the spatial graph is splittable. More surprisingly, we will also show that whether the spatial graph is splittable up to component homotopy depends only on the link homotopy class of the links contained within it. Numerical invariants of the relation will also be produced.

The noteworthy result of this study is that the selective control of the symmetric Dicke subspace can be achieved with high fidelity, thus opening up new avenues for quantum information processing applications. The paper concludes that the selective control of the symmetric Dicke subspace is an important step towards the development of scalable quantum technologies.
1756	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons with a positively defined metric in internal space in the presence of a massive Rarita-Schwinger field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a massive Rarita-Schwinger field are also emphasized.

3032	Quantum auctions are a novel application of quantum game theory that aim to improve the efficiency and security of traditional auctions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of quantum auctions and present several different protocols that have been proposed in the literature. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each protocol, and compare them to classical auctions in terms of efficiency, fairness, and resistance to fraud and collusion. Our findings suggest that quantum auctions have the potential to revolutionize the auction industry by providing more secure and efficient mechanisms for allocating resources. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this emerging technology and to develop practical implementations that can be used in real-world settings.

Under optimum conditions, fidelities of up to 0.99 for beam splitting and 0.98 for reflection are observed, and splitting operations of up to third order are achieved. The dependence of the operations on light intensity and atomic velocity is measured and found to agree well with theoretical estimates.

The results show that the inclusion of flavor degrees of freedom can significantly affect the isospin diffusion process. The researchers conclude that their findings provide insights into the properties of quark-gluon plasma, which is a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang and is believed to be recreated in high-energy particle collisions.
1578	In this article it is shown that, Sommerfeld's coefficients for excitonic transitions in quantum wells are determined only with the principle quantum number within the framework of two-dimensional Coulomb potential. This is a consequence of hidden symmetry of two-dimensional Coulomb problem, conditioned by the existence of two-dimensional analog of the Runge-Lentz vector. For the narrow gap semiconductor quantum well with the non-parabolic dispersion law of electron and hole in the two-band Kane model it is shown that two-dimensional excitonic states are described in the frames of an analog of Klein-Gordon equation with the two-dimensional Coulomb potential. The non-stability of the ground state of the two-dimensional Kane's exciton is show.
692	This research paper investigates the magnetohydrostatic properties of solar prominences in near-potential coronal magnetic fields. The study utilizes a three-dimensional MHD model to simulate the equilibrium of the prominence plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. The results show that the prominence plasma is supported by the magnetic field, which controls the pressure balance and the plasma density distribution. The dynamics of the prominence plasma are found to be influenced by the interaction between the magnetic field and the gravity of the Sun. The study also reveals the presence of magnetic dips in the prominence plasma, which are responsible for the formation of filamentary structures. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of solar prominences and the role of magnetic fields in their dynamics.
1610	Coupled-mode systems are used in physical literature to simplify the nonlinear Maxwell and Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a small periodic potential and to approximate localized solutions called gap solitons by analytical expressions involving hyperbolic functions. We justify the use of the one-dimensional stationary coupled-mode system for a relevant elliptic problem by employing the method of Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions in Fourier space. In particular, existence of periodic/anti-periodic and decaying solutions is proved and the error terms are controlled in suitable norms. The use of multi-dimensional stationary coupled-mode systems is justified for analysis of bifurcations of periodic/anti-periodic solutions in a small multi-dimensional periodic potential.
2648	In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued k-variate function h calculated at all possible sets of k points from a random sample. In the present paper we investigate the corresponding extreme value analogue, which we shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample. U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric invariants.
3773	Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.
2242	We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by tens of thousands wavelengths.
3683	"The research paper ""Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries"" focuses on the study of quantum field theory on curved backgrounds and its relationship with spacetime symmetries. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the different types of symmetries that can exist in a curved spacetime and their impact on the quantum field theory. The authors explore the effect of global and local symmetries on the renormalization of the theory and the existence of conserved currents. The significance of the findings is that they provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between symmetries and quantum field theory on curved backgrounds, which can have implications for the development of new theories in modern physics. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of further research in this area to fully understand the complexities of quantum field theory on curved backgrounds."
974	"We investigate the behaviour of an original traffic model. The model considers a single multi-lane street, populated by autonomous vehicles directed from either end to the other. Lanes have no intrinsic directionality, and the vehicles are inserted at random at either end and any lane. Collision avoidance is fully automatic and, to enhance the transport capacity of the street, vehicles form_trains_ in which they may travel at high speed quite close to the vehicle in front. We report on the transit times for vehicles under a wide variety of conditions: vehicle insertion probability & imbalance and their maximum speed distribution. We also outline an interesting feature of the model, that the complex interactions of many vehicles are considerably more powerful than a simple ""keep left"" directive which each vehicle should obey."
3567	This research paper explores the microscopic origin of magnetic ferroelectrics in nonlinear multiferroics. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the relationship between magnetism and ferroelectricity at a microscopic level. The paper also aims to understand the underlying physics of nonlinear multiferroics and their potential applications. The essential findings of the paper suggest that the coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters arises from the spin-orbit coupling and the lattice distortion. The paper concludes that the understanding of the microscopic origin of magnetic ferroelectrics in nonlinear multiferroics can lead to the development of new materials with enhanced multifunctionality for technological applications.
3972	We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.
1175	The d-wave pairing state is a well-known phenomenon in high-temperature superconductivity, but its microscopic origin is still a subject of intense research. In this paper, we explore the possibility of describing the d-wave pairing state in terms of Zhang-Rice singlets, which are local electronic states in transition metal oxides. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that the d-wave pairing state can indeed be understood in terms of Zhang-Rice singlets, and we discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. Our results shed light on the complex interplay between local electronic states and long-range quantum entanglement in strongly correlated systems.
670	This research paper presents the results of an experiment conducted at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to study the production of cascade hypernuclei. The central focus of the study is to understand the properties of these exotic nuclei, which contain strange quarks. The paper reports the observation of a new hypernuclear state in the production spectra and provides insight into the production mechanism of cascade hypernuclei. The key findings suggest that the production of cascade hypernuclei is sensitive to the incident energy and the target nucleus. These results have important implications for our understanding of nuclear physics and the properties of the strong force.
3745	We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event.
536	This paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares. Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method.
2953	This research paper examines the relationship between entropic measure and Wasserstein diffusion, two mathematical tools commonly used in probability theory and analysis. The paper presents new theoretical results on the use of entropic measure to analyze the behavior of Wasserstein diffusion, and demonstrates the applicability of these results through several numerical simulations. The main conclusion of the paper is that entropic measure can provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior of Wasserstein diffusion, particularly in cases where traditional analytical methods are insufficient. This has potential applications in fields such as finance, biology, and physics, where understanding the behavior of stochastic processes is crucial for making accurate predictions and designing effective models.
1899	This research paper investigates the competing itinerant and localized states in strongly correlated BaVS$_3$. The study employed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to observe the electronic structure of BaVS$_3$ and discovered that the material exhibits a metallic state at high temperatures and a localized state at low temperatures. The results suggest that the localized state is related to the vanadium d-orbitals, while the itinerant state is related to the presence of vanadium d-orbitals mixed with sulfur p-orbitals. This research provides insight into the electronic properties of strongly correlated materials and offers a potential avenue for the design of new materials with desired electronic properties.
2634	The research paper investigates the behavior of relativistic field theories in the presence of a strong background field, focusing on the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The authors develop a formalism for calculating the LLL spectrum and wave functions for various field theories, including QED and QCD, in a strong external magnetic field. They find that the LLL approximation is valid in the strong field regime and can be used to study the dynamics of particles in a magnetic field. The results have applications in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and astrophysics. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future experimental studies.
403	In a single-walled carbon nanotube, we observe the spin-1/2 Kondo effect. The energy of spin-resolved Kondo peaks is proportional to magnetic field at high fields, contrary to recent reports. At lower fields, the energy falls below this linear dependence, in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. For even electron occupancy, we observe a spin-1 Kondo effect due to the degeneracy of the triplet ground states. Tuning gate voltage within the same Coulomb diamond drives a transition to a singlet ground state. We also independently tune the energy difference between singlet and triplet states with a magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting thus measured confirms the value of the g-factor measured from the spin-1/2 Kondo feature.
3500	We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed.
688	This research paper investigates the potential of spin transport through Si for achieving high magnetocurrents. A novel device architecture is proposed, which is based on a Si channel with embedded CoFeB electrodes. The experimental results demonstrate a magnetocurrent of up to 35%, which is attributed to the spin injection and detection at the CoFeB/Si interface. The mechanism of spin transport is analyzed using the spin-transport model and the temperature-dependent measurements. The findings of this study provide insights into the fundamental understanding of spin transport in Si-based devices and offer a promising approach for future spintronics applications.
2221	The Lee-Wick Standard Model is a theoretical framework that modifies the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing an additional set of heavy particles with negative norm. This paper presents an overview of the Lee-Wick Standard Model, including its motivation, theoretical foundations, and experimental implications. The key outcomes of the research include the explanation of the Hierarchy Problem, the prediction of new physics phenomena at the TeV scale, and the potential for experimental verification through high energy collider experiments. The Lee-Wick Standard Model represents a promising avenue for future theoretical and experimental investigations into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe.
415	We prove that a number of classes of separable unital C*-algebras are closed under crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property, including: (1) AI algebras, AT algebras, and related classes characterized by direct limit decompositions using semiprojective building blocks. (2) Simple unital AH algebras with slow dimension growth and real rank zero. (3) C*-algebras with real rank zero or stable rank one. (4) C*-algebras whose quotients all satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Along the way, we give a systematic treatment of the derivation of direct limit decompositions from local approximation conditions by homomorphic images which are not necessarily injective.
337	We review recent results from the X-ray timing of accreting millisecond pulsars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries. This is the first time a timing analysis is performed on accreting millisecond pulsars, and for the first time we can obtain information on the behavior of a very fast pulsar subject to accretion torques. We find both spin-up and spin-down behaviors, from which, using available models for the accretion torques, we derive information on the mass accretion rate and magnetic field of the neutron star in these systems. We also find that the phase delays behavior as a function of time in these sources is sometimes quite complex and difficult to interpret, since phase shifts, most probably driven by variations of the X-ray flux, are sometimes present.
1244	This research paper aims to introduce and provide an overview of GREGOR, the New German Solar Telescope, which is a state-of-the-art solar observatory located on the island of Tenerife, Spain. This paper will discuss the technical specifications and capabilities of the telescope, including its high-resolution imaging capabilities and its ability to observe the Sun's magnetic field. It will also explore the scientific goals and objectives of the GREGOR project, which include studying the Sun's atmosphere, understanding the dynamics of solar magnetic fields, and investigating the mechanisms behind solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The paper will conclude by highlighting the potential impact of GREGOR on our understanding of the Sun and its influence on Earth's climate and technology.
3619	This research paper investigates the formation of residual nuclides in different target materials induced by proton beams with energies ranging from 0.04 to 2.6 GeV. Specifically, the study examines the production of residual nuclides in 206,207,208,nat-Pb and 209-Bi, as well as in 56-Fe. The experimental results reveal that the production cross-sections of residual nuclides are strongly dependent on the target material, proton energy, and incident angle. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of nuclear reactions induced by proton beams, and the findings may have implications for the design of future nuclear facilities and radiation shielding.
3003	We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well trap.
643	We study motion of small particles in turbulence when the particle relaxation time falls in the range of inertial time-scales of the flow. Due to inertia, particles drift relative to the fluid. We show that the drift velocity is close to the Lagrangian velocity increments of turbulence at the particle relaxation time. We demonstrate that the collective drift of two close particles makes them see local velocity increments fluctuate fast and we introduce the corresponding Langevin description for separation dynamics. This allows to describe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of Richardson's law for separation above viscous scale.
921	Quantum mechanics is formulated as a geometric theory on a Hilbert manifold. Images of charts on the manifold are allowed to belong to arbitrary Hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions. Tensor equations in this setting, also called functional tensor equations, describe families of functional equations on various Hilbert spaces of functions. The principle of functional relativity is introduced which states that quantum theory is indeed a functional tensor theory, i.e., it can be described by functional tensor equations. The main equations of quantum theory are shown to be compatible with the principle of functional relativity. By accepting the principle as a hypothesis, we then analyze the origin of physical dimensions, provide a geometric interpretation of Planck's constant, and find a simple interpretation of the two-slit experiment and the process of measurement.
1009	"The research paper titled ""On the generalized Freedman-Townsend model"" discusses a new approach for modeling the dynamics of a population. The authors introduce a generalized version of the Freedman-Townsend model, which includes additional parameters to account for different aspects of the population dynamics. The paper presents theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of the model, demonstrating its ability to capture complex dynamics such as oscillations, chaos, and extinction. The key findings of the paper suggest that the generalized model is more flexible and accurate than the original Freedman-Townsend model, providing a useful tool for studying population dynamics in various fields such as ecology, epidemiology, and economics."
3961	The paper presents a new and exact boundary condition to solve the Schrodinger equation of many-electron systems. The boundary condition involves the use of an auxiliary potential function that accurately describes the behavior of the wave function near the boundary of the system. The authors demonstrate that this new boundary condition significantly improves the accuracy of the solutions obtained, particularly for systems with strong correlations between electrons. The results obtained using the new boundary condition are compared with those obtained using other commonly used boundary conditions, and it is shown that the new approach outperforms the others in terms of accuracy. The authors conclude that the new boundary condition provides a promising approach to accurately solve the Schrodinger equation of many-electron systems and has the potential to be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical systems.
518	This research paper investigates the consistency between the renormalization group running of chiral operator and the counting rule, focusing on the case of chiral pion production operator. The main objective is to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between renormalization group running and counting rules in chiral effective field theory. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the renormalization group equations for the chiral pion production operator and derives the corresponding counting rule. The key result of the study is the demonstration of the consistency between the renormalization group running and the counting rule, which provides a solid foundation for the application of the chiral effective field theory to the calculation of physical observables. The research concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for future research in the field of chiral effective field theory.
2973	This research paper investigates the long-range correlation and multifractality of pitch series in Bach's Inventions. Through the use of multifractal analysis, we explore the complex and self-similar patterns within the musical structures of Bach's compositions. Our findings suggest that the pitch sequences in Bach's Inventions exhibit multifractal behavior, indicating a high degree of complexity and variability in the music. Additionally, we observe long-range correlations within the pitch series, revealing a persistent structure that extends throughout the entire composition. These results provide insight into the intricate and sophisticated musical structures of Bach's works and may have implications for understanding the underlying principles of music composition.
2770	This research paper investigates Compton scattering of Fe K alpha lines in magnetic cataclysmic variables. The study utilizes observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze the Fe K alpha lines in these systems and determine their scattering properties. The results demonstrate that magnetic cataclysmic variables show a significant amount of Compton scattering, which can affect the observed spectra. This finding has important implications for understanding the physical processes occurring in these systems and interpreting their X-ray emission. The conclusions of this study highlight the need for more detailed modeling of Compton scattering in magnetic cataclysmic variables to accurately interpret X-ray observations.
1075	In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.
2282	The mechanism of the shift, broadening and quenching of the ammonia inversion frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of the wavefunction.
3227	The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars, essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular, we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are due to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca process). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.
1957	Topological T-duality is a transformation taking a gerbe on a principal torus bundle to a gerbe on a principal dual-torus bundle. We give a new geometric construction of T-dualization, which allows the duality to be extended in following two directions. First, bundles of groups other than tori, even bundles of some nonabelian groups, can be dualized. Second, bundles whose duals are families of noncommutative groups (in the sense of noncommutative geometry) can be treated, though in this case the base space of the bundles is best viewed as a topological stack. Some methods developed for the construction may be of independent interest. These are a Pontryagin type duality that interchanges commutative principal bundles with gerbes, a nonabelian Takai type duality for groupoids, and the computation of certain equivariant Brauer groups.
222	We present the structure of the fully relaxed (001) surface of the half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, calculated using density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Two relevant ferroelastic order parameters are identified and characterized: The tilting of the oxygen octahedra, which is present in the bulk phase, oscillates and decreases towards the surface, and an additional ferrodistortive Mn off-centering, triggered by the surface, decays monotonically into the bulk. The narrow d-like energy band that is characteristic of unrelaxed manganite surfaces is shifted down in energy by these structural distortions, retaining its uppermost layer localization. The magnitude of the zero-temperature magnetization is unchanged from its bulk value, but the effective spin-spin interactions are reduced at the surface.
2998	This research paper investigates the bounds on the negativity of superpositions, which is a measure of entanglement in quantum systems. We derive analytical expressions for the upper and lower bounds on negativity for arbitrary superpositions and explore their properties. Our results demonstrate that the bounds on negativity can be used as a tool to identify entangled states and to quantify their degree of entanglement. We also show that our bounds are tight for certain classes of states, providing a useful benchmark for experimental investigations. Our findings have important implications for quantum information processing, including quantum communication and quantum computation, where entangled states play a crucial role.
2361	"The research paper titled ""Adhesion forces due to nano-triboelectrification between similar materials"" aims to investigate the effect of electrostatic forces on the adhesion behavior of similar materials at the nanoscale. The study employs atomic force microscopy to measure the adhesion forces between two identical materials under different conditions, including varying relative humidity and contact time. The results reveal that the adhesion forces are significantly influenced by the accumulation of surface charges due to triboelectrification. The study concludes that the electrostatic forces play a crucial role in determining the adhesion behavior between similar materials, and a deeper understanding of these forces is essential for various applications, including nanofabrication and material science."
2628	"The research paper titled ""SkyMapper and the Southern Sky Survey - a resource for the southern sky"" presents an overview of the SkyMapper telescope and its survey of the southern sky. The paper highlights the importance of the survey in providing a comprehensive database of celestial objects in the region. The authors discuss the technical aspects of the survey, including data processing and analysis, and present some of the key findings from the survey. The paper concludes that SkyMapper and the Southern Sky Survey have provided valuable data to the astronomical community and will continue to be an important resource for future studies of the southern sky."
2110	A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0.001.
D2-69	Lavoisier was born in 1743 into a wealthy family of lawyers, and initially prepared for a legal career, being awarded a baccalaureate in law in 1763. Antoine Lavoisier played the central role in what has come to be known as the chemical revolution and he was active also in agricultural and fiscal reform as well as technological development. He is credited with establishing that oxygen is an element and water its compound with hydrogen, refining experimental methods in chemistry, reforming chemical nomenclature along systematic lines, defining element operationally, and denying phlogiston a place in chemical explanation. This chapter critically examines the analytical conception of the elements that Lavoisier proposes.
569	This research paper investigates the curious case of NGC6908, a peculiar galaxy located in the southern skies. Through the analysis of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic data, we explore the physical properties and evolutionary history of this galaxy, including its morphology, kinematics, and chemical composition. We find that NGC6908 exhibits a complex structure with multiple components, including a central bar, a nuclear ring, and a surrounding disk. Furthermore, we discover evidence of recent star formation activity and gas inflows, suggesting ongoing dynamical processes. Ultimately, our findings shed light on the intricate nature of galaxy evolution and provide new insights into the formation and evolution of peculiar galaxies.
970	There is evidence for the existence of massive planets at orbital radii of several hundred AU from their parent stars where the timescale for planet formation by core accretion is longer than the disc lifetime. These planets could have formed close to their star and then migrated outwards. We consider how the transfer of angular momentum by viscous disc interactions from a massive inner planet could cause significant outward migration of a smaller outer planet. We find that it is in principle possible for planets to migrate to large radii. We note, however, a number of effects which may render the process somewhat problematic.
D1-25	Although the earliest life seems to have arisen quite soon in Earth’s history, less than 800 million years after its formation, simple forms continued for 1.6 billion years until the multicellular Francevillian biota developed and quickly died out about 2.1 billion years ago. After that, although multicellular forms were in existence from about 1.7 billion years ago, it was not until the Cambrian ‘explosion’ from 540–500 million years ago that multicellular life expanded and prospered. This is essentially what we know. But fossilisation is rare and early life has resulted in tiny traces  difficult to interpret. At present there are believed to be about one trillion species on Earth, less than one per cent of those which have ever lived.
184	We present in this paper three dynamic clustering techniques for Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs). The first two, Dynamic, Statistical & Tunable Clustering (DSTC) and StatClust, exploit both comprehensive usage statistics and the inter-object reference graph. They are quite elaborate. However, they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead. The third clustering technique, called Detection & Reclustering of Objects (DRO), is based on the same principles, but is much simpler to implement. These three clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store and compared in terms of clustering efficiency (i.e., overall performance increase) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark (OCB). The results obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving better overall performance.
3652	The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a powerful telescope capable of observing the solar chromosphere in unprecedented detail. In this research paper, we argue that ALMA is the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity, and ability to observe at multiple wavelengths. We review recent observations of the chromosphere using ALMA and discuss how these observations have improved our understanding of the dynamics and structure of this region of the solar atmosphere. We also discuss future directions for ALMA observations of the chromosphere and their potential impact on our understanding of solar physics. Overall, we conclude that ALMA is an essential tool for studying the chromosphere and will continue to provide valuable insights into this important region of the Sun.
34	"The research paper titled ""Bistability of optically-induced nuclear spin orientation in quantum dots"" investigates the behavior of nuclear spins in quantum dots under various optical and magnetic conditions. The primary subject of the study is the bistability of nuclear spin orientation, which refers to the ability of the system to exist in two stable states with different spin orientations. The researchers found that by controlling the optical and magnetic fields, they could induce and manipulate the bistability of nuclear spin orientation in the quantum dots. They also discovered that the duration of the spin polarization was dependent on the strength of the magnetic field. The study's main conclusion is that the bistability of nuclear spin orientation in quantum dots can be controlled and utilized for various practical applications, such as quantum information processing and spin-based electronics."
891	This research paper explores the matter-wave interference in s-wave and p-wave Fermi condensates. The study aims to investigate the impact of the interaction between the two types of condensates on the interference pattern. The research involved performing experiments and numerical simulations to observe the interference pattern and analyze the results. The critical outcome of the study is that the interference pattern in p-wave Fermi condensates is significantly different from that in s-wave Fermi condensates due to the presence of a nodal plane. The study concludes that the matter-wave interference in Fermi condensates can provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum systems and can be applied in the development of new quantum technologies.
1538	We explore the main physical processes which potentially affect the topological signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for a range of toroidal universes. We consider specifically reionisation, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the size of the causal horizon, topological defects and primordial gravitational waves. We use three estimators: the information content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma ranges allowed by present data. We find that only Omega_Lambda, which influences both ISW and the size of the causal horizon, significantly alters the detection for all three estimators considered here.
2167	This research paper focuses on reciprocal transformations and flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces. The Hurwitz space is a space of branched covers of the Riemann sphere, and reciprocal transformations are a type of transformation that preserves the branch points of these covers. The paper presents a new method for constructing flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces using reciprocal transformations. The authors demonstrate that this method produces flat metrics that are different from previously known metrics on Hurwitz spaces. The paper also provides examples of these new flat metrics and discusses their properties. The essential findings of this research highlight the effectiveness of using reciprocal transformations to construct new flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces, which can lead to further insights into the geometry of these spaces.
2057	When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible with the Holographic Principle.
D2-28	Fossils have played a significant role in shaping Greek mythology, as ancient Greeks often interpreted large, mysterious bones as evidence of mythical creatures. The discovery of massive fossils, such as those of mammoths, mastodons, and prehistoric reptiles, likely influenced myths about giants, cyclopes, and dragons. For instance, the large skulls of prehistoric elephants, which have a central nasal cavity, may have been mistaken for the skulls of one-eyed Cyclopes, reinforcing the legend of these formidable beings. Similarly, fossilized bones of large extinct animals could have inspired stories of titans and heroes slaying monstrous beasts. Greek naturalists like Herodotus and Pliny the Elder documented fossil findings, showing early attempts to explain these remains within a mythological and historical framework.
3634	This research paper investigates the regions of feasible point-to-point trajectories in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators. The study aims to identify the geometric constraints that restrict the end-effector's motion and determine the feasible regions of motion. The research employs mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to develop a methodology for analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the manipulator's geometry in determining the feasible regions of motion and provide insights into the design of parallel manipulators for optimal performance. The research concludes that the proposed methodology is effective in analyzing the workspace of parallel manipulators and can be used in the design and optimization of these systems.
315	We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the radiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large anomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an extra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be generated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the conformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs mass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with the Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as the Z boson decay width.
1875	The Wess-Zumino consistency condition is a crucial tool for understanding the behavior of Weyl anomalies in conformal field theories. In this research paper, we explore the general solutions of this condition, which provide insights into the underlying structure of conformal field theories. Our findings reveal that the solutions can be expressed in terms of topological invariants and that they are closely related to the Schwinger terms in the effective action. We also show that the solutions can be used to obtain constraints on the central charges of the theory. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental properties of conformal field theories and has important implications for the broader field of theoretical physics.
2610	This research paper investigates the performance of antenna combining techniques for the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) downlink channel. The study compares different combining schemes, including maximum-ratio combining (MRC), selection combining (SC), and equal-gain combining (EGC), in terms of their bit error rate (BER) and ergodic capacity. Simulation results show that MRC outperforms SC and EGC, achieving higher BER and ergodic capacity. Additionally, the performance of MRC is shown to improve with the increase in the number of antennas at the base station.

2753	Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of (relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
2056	This research paper investigates the light curves of dwarf Plutonian planets and other large Kuiper Belt objects, focusing on their rotations, phase functions, and absolute magnitudes. Using data from ground-based and space-based telescopes, we analyze the brightness variations of these objects as they rotate on their axes and as they orbit the sun. Our results reveal a diverse range of rotation periods and phase functions among these objects, with some showing evidence of surface features and others displaying more uniform reflectivity. We also derive absolute magnitudes for these objects, which provide important information for understanding their physical properties and formation history. This research contributes to our overall understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the outer solar system.
3638	The glass transition in one-component liquids with anisotropic potential is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. In this research paper, we investigate the mechanism of glass transition using computer simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the anisotropy of the potential has a significant impact on the glass-forming ability of the liquid. We find that the glass transition occurs when the relaxation time of the liquid becomes extremely long, and the system becomes stuck in a metastable state. Moreover, we show that the dynamics of the glass transition can be described by a mode-coupling theory, which predicts the existence of a critical point separating the liquid and glass phases. Our findings provide insight into the fundamental physics of glass transition and have important implications for materials science and engineering.
1095	We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of data warehouses. Benchmarking is useful either to system users for comparing the performances of different systems, or to system engineers for testing the effect of various design choices. While the TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council) standard benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the second one. Our Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized. However, two levels of parameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineering benchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and not a competitor. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management systems.
1945	This research paper focuses on the use of boundary triplets and M-functions for non-selfadjoint operators in the context of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) and block operator matrices.

3780	In this research paper, the authors investigate the thermal entanglement properties of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, a two-dimensional lattice system with frustrated interactions. They find that the entanglement entropy of the qubit pairs exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as the temperature is increased, with a peak at a critical temperature. This behavior is attributed to the competition between the thermal fluctuations and the underlying lattice geometry. The authors also show that the critical temperature can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the interactions. Overall, the results suggest that the Shastry-Sutherland lattice is a promising platform for exploring entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical applications of this work, including the use of 7-colourings in designing visual art and creating encryption algorithms.
3374	This research paper examines the energy distribution of a charged black hole with a minimally coupled scalar field. The study utilizes the Newman-Penrose formalism to derive the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field and investigates the energy distribution in the presence of a black hole charge. The results show that the presence of the charge significantly affects the energy distribution, leading to a shift in the location of the energy peak.

807	We study thermodynamical properties of a fuzzy sphere in matrix quantum mechanics of the BFSS type including the Chern-Simons term. Various quantities are calculated to all orders in perturbation theory exploiting the one-loop saturation of the effective action in the large-N limit. The fuzzy sphere becomes unstable at sufficiently strong coupling, and the critical point is obtained explicitly as a function of the temperature. The whole phase diagram is investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Above the critical point, we obtain perfect agreement with the all order results. In the region below the critical point, which is not accessible by perturbation theory, we observe the Hagedorn transition. In the high temperature limit our model is equivalent to a totally reduced model, and the relationship to previously known results is clarified.

816	This research paper aims to develop a rational method for investigating the dissociation of macromolecules, particularly in the antibody-hapten system. The study involved the design and synthesis of hapten analogs with varying affinities to the antibody and the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the dissociation constants of the antibody-hapten complexes. The results showed that the dissociation of the complexes was dependent on the binding affinity of the hapten to the antibody and the structural properties of the antibody. The developed method can be used to predict the dissociation behavior of macromolecules and aid in the design of more effective therapeutics. Overall, the study provides new insights into the fundamental principles underlying macromolecular dissociation and its implications in drug design and development.
3932	We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.

3220	The article discusses the use of the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows to probe the structure of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. The author explains that the steep decay phase is caused by the interaction between the GRB jet and its surrounding medium, which can provide valuable information about the jet's properties. By analyzing the steep decay phase, researchers can determine the jet's collimation angle, energy, and magnetic field strength. The article also highlights the importance of multi-wavelength observations in studying GRBs, as they provide a more complete picture of the event. The author concludes that studying the steep decay phase of X-ray afterglows is a promising approach to understanding the structure and properties of GRB jets.
2239	This research paper investigates the magnetic field penetration in a type-I superconductor and provides evidence for nonmonotonic behavior. The main objective of this study is to understand the complex behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields. The authors conducted experiments on a lead sample and used a sensitive magnetometer to measure the magnetic field inside the superconductor. The results show that the magnetic field penetration is not a monotonic function of the applied field, but instead exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with a peak in the penetration depth. This suggests that the magnetic field interacts with the superconducting electrons in a complex and nontrivial way. The study provides important insights into the behavior of superconductors in the presence of magnetic fields and could have implications for the design of superconducting devices.
2041	This research paper examines the stability properties of strongly magnetized spine sheath relativistic jets, with a primary focus on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Using numerical simulations, the authors find that the stability of the jet depends on the strength of the magnetic field, with weaker fields leading to more unstable jets. Furthermore, they find that the spine-sheath structure of the jet can enhance the stability of the jet by suppressing the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of astrophysical jets, such as those observed in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts.
2644	This research paper aims to provide a tight bound on the security of coherent states quantum key distribution with heterodyne detection. We investigate the security of the protocol under various eavesdropping attacks and derive a lower bound on the secure key rate. Our analysis reveals that the heterodyne detection method can achieve a higher secure key rate compared to the standard homodyne detection approach. We also demonstrate that our bound is tight, which means that it provides an accurate estimation of the achievable secure key rate. Our results suggest that coherent states quantum key distribution with heterodyne detection can be a promising approach for secure communication in practical quantum networks.
2680	We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems: 1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative, with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.

509	It had been proposed that overstretching double stranded DNA from the 5-5 ends will produce a new fiber form of dsDNA that is narrower than the S form that has been suggested to result when the dsDNA is overstretched from the 3-3 ends. We present the first comparison of the structures that result when dsDNA is overstretched from the 5-5, 3-3, and 3-5 ends and show that the stability of the overstretched form depends on the ends to which the force is applied. The stability also depends strongly on the ionic environment as well as the presence of reagents that bind to ssDNA.
D2-90	The principle of positron emission tomography (PET) is that radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical injected intravenously into a patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations. This is a technology that is extremely useful in the detection and treatment of diseases like cancer. However, there is some confusion about how PET works. Before PET was introduced a different type of radiation imaging called SPECT (single-photon emission computerised tomography) was used. This technology was based on the pinhole camera technique whereby a reverse image of an object is obtained by passing the light through a small aperture or pinhole.
D1-28	Significant climatic oscillations on sub-centurial (50–55 years, 60–65 years) and quasi-centurial (120–130 years) timescales are thought to arise from natural variability in Earth's climate system, driven by a combination of internal processes and external forcing mechanisms. The causes of these oscillations include: Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are large-scale oceanic patterns of variability that operate on multidecadal timescales (50–70 years). These affect global heat distribution, weather patterns, and long-term climate trends. Solar Variability Variations in solar activity, such as the Gleissberg Cycle (~80–120 years), impact Earth's climate. Changes in solar irradiance affect atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation, and surface temperatures.
2870	We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures, antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition, these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered structures.
866	We survey the few exact results on the Stormer problem describing the dynamics of charged particles in the Earth magnetosphere. The analysis of this system leads to the the conclusion that charged particles are trapped in the Earth magnetosphere or escape to infinity, and the trapping region is bounded by a torus-like surface, the Van Allen inner radiation belt. In the trapping region, the motion of the charged particles can be periodic, quasi-period or chaotic. The three main effects observed in the Earth magnetosphere, radiation belts, radiation aurorae and South Atlantic anomaly, are described in the framework described here. We discuss some new mathematical problems suggested by the analysis of the Stormer problem.
3688	We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.
D2-49	"According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single ""Primorial Particle"". ""Divine Volition"", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology."

378	"The research paper titled ""Measuring Bremsstrahlung Photons in 200 GeV p+p Collisions"" investigates the production of Bremsstrahlung photons in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV. The study utilized the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to measure the photons' energy distribution and compare it with theoretical models.

1078	"The research paper titled ""A Simple Optical Analysis of Gravitational Lensing"" explores the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The main subject of the paper is to analyze the optical effects of gravitational lensing on light by demonstrating a simple model. The study shows that the lensing effect can be explained by using the laws of geometric optics, and the focal length of the lens can be calculated by measuring the distance between the observer, the lens, and the source.

The paper concludes that understanding the phenomenon of gravitational lensing can lead to a better understanding of the universe's structure and evolution."
D1-8	Thalidomide is a drug that was first developed in the 1950s as a sedative and later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. However, it caused severe birth defects, including missing or malformed limbs, when taken during pregnancy. The tragedy affected thousands of babies and led to stricter drug regulations worldwide. Despite its harmful past, thalidomide was later found to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Today, it is used under strict controls to treat multiple myeloma, leprosy-related inflammation, and some autoimmune diseases. Due to its risks, it is only prescribed under a controlled program to prevent use during pregnancy. Its history remains a major lesson in pharmaceutical safety.
1512	A new algorithm has been developed to compute low Mach Numbers supercritical fluid flows. The algorithm is applied using a finite volume method based on the SIMPLER algorithm. Its main advantages are to decrease significantly the CPU time, and the possibility for supercritical fluid flow modelisation to use other discretisation methods (such as spectral methods and/or finite differences) and other algorithms such as PISO or projection. It makes it possible to solve 3D problems within reasonable CPU time even when considering complex equations of state. The algorithm is given after first a brief description of the previously existing algorithm to solve for supercritical fluids. The side and bottom heated near critical carbon dioxide filled cavity problems are respectively solved and compared to the previously obtained results.
454	"The research paper titled ""Improving Estimates of Monotone Functions by Rearrangement"" presents a novel approach to improve the estimation of monotone functions in the presence of noise.

D2-30	More than 1,900 species of edible insects are consumed worldwide. However, this number continues to increase as more studies are carried out on this issue. Most of these known species are collected directly from the natural environment, but available data on the amounts of insects that are ingested worldwide are scarce. In any case, there is agreement that of the hundreds of insect species used as human food worldwide, the most common can be encompassed into four groups: beetles; ants, bees and wasps; grasshoppers and crickets and, finally, moths, caterpillars, and butterflies. According to FAO, the most consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera, 31%), caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 18%) and bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera, 14%).
2958	We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail, with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes. However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent interference minima.

245	The frictional heating by ion-neutral drift is calculated and its effect on isobaric thermal instability is carried out. Ambipolar drift heating of one-dimensional self-gravitating magnetized molecular slab is used under the assumptions of quasi-magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibrium. We see that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions. The results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in some regions of the slab; therefore it may produce the slab fragmentation and formation of the AU-scale condensations.
187	"The research paper titled ""Projecting Massive Scalar Fields to Null Infinity"" presents a mathematical framework for studying the behavior of massive scalar fields in the vicinity of null infinity. The study is motivated by the need to understand the gravitational waves emitted by black hole mergers. The authors develop a formalism for projecting the scalar field onto null infinity and use it to study the asymptotic behavior of the field. They find that the field decays as a power law and identify the exponent as a function of the mass of the scalar. The results have implications for the detection of gravitational waves and the study of black hole dynamics."
3468	Nuclear medicine (NM) images inherently suffer from large amounts of noise and blur. The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM images.

1487	This research paper investigates whether extrasolar oceans are prevalent throughout the galaxy. The paper reviews the current knowledge of exoplanets and their potential to harbor liquid water oceans. The researchers analyze data from various telescopes and simulations to determine the likelihood of extrasolar oceans. The results suggest that the existence of extrasolar oceans is dependent on multiple factors, including the distance from the host star and the planet's composition. The researchers conclude that while extrasolar oceans are not as common as previously thought, their existence is still possible in certain conditions. This finding has significant implications for the search for life beyond our solar system.
2516	We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring significant penalties.
3370	"The research paper ""Field-Theoretic Simulations of Polyelectrolyte Complexation"" presents a study of the complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes using field-theoretic simulations. The authors investigate the effects of various parameters such as charge density, chain length, and salt concentration on the complexation process. They find that the complexation behavior is strongly influenced by the charge density and chain length of the polyelectrolytes, as well as the ionic strength of the solution. The simulations also reveal the formation of various types of complex structures, including spherical and cylindrical micelles, as well as interconnected networks. The study provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the complexation of polyelectrolytes and has implications for a wide range of applications in fields such as biotechnology and materials science."
861	This research paper presents a finite element method for solving the time-independent Schroedinger equation, which is widely used in quantum mechanics. The primary focus is on developing an accurate and efficient numerical method for solving this equation. The remarkable finding is that the proposed method is capable of producing highly accurate results with a relatively small number of elements.

234	This research paper investigates the angular momentum transport in accretion disks, specifically focusing on the scaling laws in magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulence. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the behavior of accretion disks and their ability to transport angular momentum. The findings suggest that the MRI-driven turbulence in accretion disks follows a universal scaling law, which can be used to accurately predict the transport of angular momentum in these systems. This research provides a better understanding of the fundamental processes that drive accretion disks and may have implications for the study of black holes and other astrophysical phenomena.
1131	We show that the centrality and system-size dependence of elliptic flow measured at RHIC are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization. We argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25% below the (ideal) ``hydrodynamic limit'', even for the most central Au-Au collisions. This lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio. We also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data, in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound.
3015	We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities, the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties are determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three- and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the four-particle ring exchange.
883	This research paper explores the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which are solutions to Einstein's field equations and describe the expansion of the universe. The paper focuses on the mathematical properties of these static forms and derives the necessary conditions for their existence. The main conclusion of the paper is that the static forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes are limited to specific cases, and that the majority of these spacetimes are expanding or contracting. This research provides valuable insights into the nature of the universe and the mathematical structure of Einstein's theory of general relativity.
3016	"In this research paper titled ""Spin coupling in zigzag Wigner crystals,"" the authors investigate the behavior of the spin coupling in a one-dimensional zigzag Wigner crystal. Using numerical simulations, they demonstrate that the spin coupling is highly sensitive to the geometry of the crystal and can be strongly influenced by the presence of impurities. The authors also show that this behavior is closely related to the finite size effects and the presence of edge states in the system. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the fundamental physics of Wigner crystals and may have important implications for the design of future spintronic devices."
1035	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of spontaneous chirality, wherein chiral structures spontaneously form without the presence of any chiral molecules or external stimuli. The study focuses on the role of long-range electrostatic forces in driving the formation of these structures. The research utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to model systems of charged particles and study the emergence of chirality. The results demonstrate that long-range electrostatic forces can indeed drive the spontaneous formation of chiral structures, and that the strength of the electrostatic interactions plays a critical role in determining the degree of chirality observed. The findings have important implications for understanding the emergence of chirality in biological systems and the design of new materials with chiral properties.
2456	Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and statistics scale with various parameters.
3714	This research paper explores the application of real options theory to project scheduling decision-making. The concept of real options allows project managers to make more informed decisions by considering the value of flexibility and the ability to adjust project schedules based on new information. The study presents a framework for implementing Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS), which involves identifying critical decision points and evaluating the value of different scheduling options. The framework is applied to a case study of a construction project, demonstrating the potential benefits of using ROPS in project management. Results suggest that ROPS can help project managers make more informed decisions, reduce project risks, and improve project outcomes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of ROPS for project management theory and practice.
D2-55	In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.
3170	We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting, the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling, and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization, where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on the size of nanoparticle.
D2-38	The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS .
1189	"The research paper titled ""Predicting the connectivity of primate cortical networks from topological and spatial node properties"" focuses on understanding the patterns of connectivity in primate cortical networks. The study found that there is a strong relationship between the spatial location of cortical nodes and their connectivity patterns, with nodes that are closer together tending to have more connections. Additionally, the study found that certain topological features of the network, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, were also predictive of connectivity patterns. Overall, the study suggests that both spatial and topological properties are important in understanding the organization of primate cortical networks and may have implications for understanding brain function and dysfunction."
336	This research paper explores the use of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the analysis of resource-sensitive computations in programming languages. Through the use of linear logic and game semantics, we demonstrate how resource modalities can provide a powerful tool for reasoning about the allocation and consumption of resources in programming. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to the interpretation of resource modalities in game semantics, which allows for the construction of game models that accurately capture the behavior of resource-sensitive programs. Our findings suggest that the use of resource modalities in game semantics can greatly enhance our ability to reason about resource usage in programming languages.
3169	This research paper aims to investigate the problem of enumerating limit groups, which are important objects in geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology. The paper begins with an overview of limit groups, their properties, and their significance in various areas of mathematics. Then, we present a survey of existing algorithms and techniques for enumerating limit groups, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also propose a new algorithm that employs a combination of geometric and algebraic methods to compute the number of limit groups up to a given isomorphism class. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through several examples and comparisons with existing methods. Finally, we discuss open problems and directions for future research in this area. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of research on limit groups and provides new insights into their enumeration.
498	In order to describe a nonuniform equilibrium mixture with an interface between two coexisting phases it is necessary to consider contributions to the Helmholtz energy which depend on the gradients of for instance the density. Van der Waals \cite{vdW/sg, vdW/translation} was the first to introduce such a term, which is very important in the interfacial region for a one-component system. Cahn & Hilliard \cite{cahnhilliard/fens/I} extended this analysis to a binary mixture by introducing gradient terms of the mol fraction. We give an systematic extension of the gradient theory to three-dimensional multi-component systems.
2187	This research paper delves into the regularity properties of separable amenable C*-algebras in the classification program. The study focuses on identifying and characterizing certain regularity properties in these algebras that play a crucial role in the classification process. The research highlights the significance of these properties in the development of a unified classification theory for C*-algebras. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and utilizing these regularity properties in the classification program for separable amenable C*-algebras. Overall, this study sheds light on a crucial aspect of C*-algebra classification and provides valuable insights into the subject.
3075	For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an integrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, and also to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for software architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate several types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven approach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small example. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the generation of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to support the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical application domains.
1624	A long duration photon beam can induce macroscopic coherent effects on a plasma by single photon electron scattering if the probability of the interaction approaches 1 in a volume of unit surface and length equal to the plasma typical wavelength, and the induced electron oscillations become relativistic in few plasma cycles. A fraction of the plasma electrons is accelerated through the Wakefield mechanism by the cavities created by the photon-electron interactions and radiates through boosted betraton emission in the same cavities. The resulting emission in this framework is very similar to the typical GRB radiation. Several comparisons with GRB light curves and spectral-energy correlations will be presented.
2733	"The research paper titled ""Balance of forces in simulated bilayers"" investigates the mechanical properties of lipid bilayers using molecular dynamics simulations. The authors focus on understanding the balance of forces that govern the behavior of bilayers in different environments. They show that the interplay between the elastic properties of the lipids and the external forces acting on the bilayer determines its response to deformation. The paper also highlights the importance of accurately modeling the lipid-protein interactions in bilayers to study their mechanical properties. Overall, the study provides insights into the fundamental principles underlying the behavior of lipid bilayers, which have significant implications for various biological and technological applications involving membranes."
D2-71	Metabolic engineering is the field of biotechnology that involves the modification of an organism’s metabolic pathways to enhance the production of desired products, such as chemicals, fuels, pharmaceuticals, or food ingredients. By altering or optimizing the flow of metabolites within cells, metabolic engineers aim to improve the efficiency and yield of biochemical processes. This is done through techniques like gene editing, overexpression of enzymes, and the introduction of new pathways. Metabolic engineering has applications in industrial biotechnology, where it enables the production of biofuels, antibiotics, and biodegradable plastics, and is also crucial for improving processes in medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
D2-24	Entomophagy—the practice of consuming insects as food—has deep historical roots in many cultures worldwide, with approximately 2 billion people regularly incorporating insects into their diets. While Western societies have traditionally viewed insects with disgust, growing environmental and food security concerns have sparked renewed interest in this protein source. Nutritionally, edible insects offer impressive benefits. Most species provide complete proteins containing all essential amino acids, often at higher concentrations than conventional meats. Many insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins, while containing healthy fats including omega-3 fatty acids. Cricket flour, for example, contains approximately 60-70% protein by weight, exceeding most plant and animal sources.
D2-94	Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, systems, and organisms or to re-engineer existing biological systems for specific purposes. It involves creating synthetic genetic circuits, modifying genomes, or designing artificial enzymes to carry out tasks that natural organisms cannot. The goal of synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to biology, enabling the synthesis of novel compounds, the production of biofuels, the development of new therapeutics, and innovations in environmental sustainability. It has vast potential for applications in medicine, agriculture, energy, and biotechnology, but also raises important ethical and safety considerations.
165	Microfabrication of graphene devices used in many experimental studies currently relies on the fact that graphene crystallites can be visualized using optical microscopy if prepared on top of silicon wafers with a certain thickness of silicon dioxide. We study graphene's visibility and show that it depends strongly on both thickness of silicon dioxide and light wavelength. We have found that by using monochromatic illumination, graphene can be isolated for any silicon dioxide thickness, albeit 300 nm (the current standard) and, especially, approx. 100 nm are most suitable for its visual detection. By using a Fresnel-law-based model, we quantitatively describe the experimental data without any fitting parameters.
D2-41	Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are part of the Standard Model of particle physics and are classified as elementary particles, meaning they have no known substructure. Quarks come in six types, or flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. They always exist in groups, held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called gluons. The most common quarks in nature are up and down, which combine to form protons and neutrons. Quarks have fractional electric charges and cannot exist independently outside of bound states due to a phenomenon called color confinement.
907	This research paper proposes a sample size cognizant method for detecting signals in white noise that takes into account the number of samples available for analysis. The method is based on the likelihood ratio test and uses a Bayesian approach to estimate the threshold for signal detection. The authors show that this method outperforms traditional methods that do not consider the sample size, especially when the number of samples is small. The method is demonstrated through simulations and real-world examples, and the results show that it is effective in detecting signals in various scenarios. The authors conclude that considering sample size is crucial for accurate signal detection and that their proposed method can be a useful tool for researchers and practitioners in signal processing and related fields.
D2-70	Lavoisier’s law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This fundamental principle, proposed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, is crucial to the field of chemistry and science in general. It laid the foundation for modern chemistry by establishing that the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of products. This law enabled scientists to develop more accurate chemical equations and understand that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or annihilation. Lavoisier’s law was vital in refuting earlier theories like the phlogiston theory and is key to stoichiometry.
2206	The IEEE 802.11e standard revises the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the former IEEE 802.11 standard for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision in the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of 802.11e defines multiple Access Categories (AC) with AC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and prioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which incorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic load. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer buffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads, EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.
3078	Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass exo-planets.
109	"We first present a simple proof that for any bipartite lattice at half filling the RKKY interaction is antiferromagnetic between impurities on opposite (i.e., A and B) sublattices and is ferromagnetic between impurities on the same sublattices. This result is valid on all length scales. We then focus on the honeycomb lattice and examine the theorem in the long distance limit by performing the low energy calculation using Dirac electrons. To find the universal (cutoff free) result we perform the calculation in smooth cutoff schemes, as we show that the calculation based on a sharp cutoff leads to wrong results. We also find the long distance behavior of the RKKY interaction between ""plaquette"" impurities in both coherent and incoherent regimes."
14	A model describing the influence of torsion stress on the giant magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction is proposed. The wire impedance is found by means of the solution of Maxwell equations together with the Landau-Lifshitz equation, assuming a simplified spatial distribution of the magnetoelastic anisotropy induced by the torsion stress. The impedance is analyzed as a function of the external magnetic field, torsion stress and frequency. It is shown that the magnetoimpedance ratio torsion dependence has an asymmetric shape, with a sharp peak at some value of the torsion stress. The calculated field and stress dependences of the impedance are in qualitative agreement with results of the experimental study of the torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in Co-based amorphous wires.
1759	This research paper investigates the use of the sulphur lines in the near-infrared triplet at 1045 nm to determine sulphur abundances in stars. The study uses high-resolution spectra of a sample of stars to measure the equivalent widths of the sulphur lines and calculate the sulphur abundances. The results show that the SI triplet at 1045 nm is a reliable indicator of sulphur abundance in stars, and the method can be used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and other galaxies. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.
1491	"The research paper titled ""The M33 Variable Star Population Revealed by Spitzer"" presents a comprehensive study of the variable star population in the M33 galaxy by analyzing data obtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the different types of variable stars, their properties, and their distribution within the galaxy. The paper presents various important findings, including the identification of new variable stars, the confirmation of previously known variables, and the characterization of the different types of variability. The conclusions drawn from the study provide insights into the evolution and properties of stars in the M33 galaxy and contribute to our understanding of the larger population of stars in the universe."
7	This research paper delves into the area of algebraic topology, where we investigate the relationship between link concordance, homology cobordism, and Hirzebruch-type defects. We explore this relationship through the study of iterated p-covers and their associated groups. Our findings reveal a connection between these structures, with significant implications for our understanding of knot theory and the classification of 4-manifolds. Specifically, we show that the existence of Hirzebruch-type defects in iterated p-covers implies the non-triviality of link concordance classes, and we establish a new criterion for homology cobordism. Our research provides new insights into the interplay between topological invariants, paving the way for further exploration in this area.
D2-1	The Solar System faces a dramatic future over billions of years. In approximately 5-7 billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury and Venus. Earth may either be consumed or rendered uninhabitable as oceans and atmosphere evaporate. The outer planets will survive but experience significant changes in temperature and orbital dynamics. Eventually, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a white dwarf star. This white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, leaving our former solar neighborhood incredibly dim. Any surviving planets will orbit in perpetual darkness, frozen and lifeless.
3067	The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.
900	One of the main open questions in liaison theory is whether every homogeneous Cohen-Macaulay ideal in a polynomial ring is glicci, i.e. if it is in the G-liaison class of a complete intersection. We give an affirmative answer to this question for Stanley-Reisner ideals defined by simplicial complexes that are weakly vertex-decomposable. This class of complexes includes matroid, shifted and Gorenstein complexes respectively. Moreover, we construct a simplicial complex which shows that the property of being glicci depends on the characteristic of the base field. As an application of our methods we establish new evidence for two conjectures of Stanley on partitionable complexes and on Stanley decompositions.
3180	We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants. It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants. We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel conceptual proof.
1944	Starting with an adjoint pair of operators, under suitable abstract versions of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl M-function of extensions of the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions and we establish results on the relationship between the M-function as an analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We also give an example where the M-function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to elliptic PDEs where the M-function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.
81	An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th/0609202, and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in (2+1)-dimensional AdS.
275	"The research paper titled ""Chirality and Equilibrium Biopolymer Bundles"" investigates the role of chirality in the formation and stability of biopolymer bundles. The primary theme of the research is to explore how the chirality of individual biopolymers affects their ability to assemble into bundles and maintain equilibrium. The study employs computer simulations and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that chirality plays a crucial role in determining the stability of biopolymer bundles. The research concludes that chirality is an indispensable factor in the self-assembly of biopolymer bundles and may have important implications for understanding the structure and function of biological systems."
693	Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology' approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger. I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of stability of biological order.
2233	This paper examines the potential effects of mergers on the mass scaling relations between black holes, galaxies, and other gravitationally bound systems. We analyze data from various surveys and simulations to investigate the impact of mergers on the growth and evolution of these systems. Our results suggest that mergers can significantly alter the mass scaling relations, leading to deviations from the expected relationships. We also explore the implications of these findings for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes, and discuss the key factors that may influence the effects of mergers on mass scaling relations. Overall, this study provides important insights into the complex interplay between mergers and the dynamics of gravitationally bound systems, with potential implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.
1657	"The research paper titled ""Adjoint Functors and Heteromorphisms"" emphasizes the importance of adjoint functors and heteromorphisms in category theory. The paper explores the relationship between these concepts and their significance in mathematical structures. The authors provide a detailed explanation of adjoint functors and heteromorphisms, including their properties and examples of their usage. Additionally, the paper covers the relationship between these concepts and other mathematical structures, such as limit and colimit. The essential findings of the paper suggest that adjoint functors and heteromorphisms are essential tools for understanding mathematical structures and their relationships. The authors conclude that these concepts play a crucial role in modern mathematics and are essential for solving complex problems in various fields such as computer science, physics, and economics. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the importance of adjoint functors and heteromorphisms in category theory."
2406	We apply quantum filtering and control to a particle in a harmonic trap under continuous position measurement, and show that a simple static feedback law can be used to cool the system. The final steady state is Gaussian and dependent on the feedback strength and coupling between the system and probe. In the limit of weak coupling this final state becomes the ground state. An earlier model by Haine et. al. (PRA 69, 2004) without measurement back-action showed dark states: states that did not display error signals, thus remaining unaffected by the control. This paper shows that for a realistic measurement process this is not true, which indicates that a Bose-Einstein condensate may be driven towards the ground state from any arbitrary initial state.
D2-47	Systems Biology is not one thing, and is quite different to different people. In my view Systems Biology is really a modern perspective on doing basic Biology research. It is not really an applied field, intending to directly be useful for industry and make products. Instead it aims to unlock the key principles of life, which can be used to do that thereafter. However, a lot of the processes of Systems Biology involves using cutting edge tools, especially computational ones, which can give you a good handle on the process of being a “data scientist”, handling large amount of experimentally obtained data, processing and analyzing it to make decisions about future course of actions.
3977	This paper provides a comprehensive review of semiconductor quantum light sources, focusing on their applications in quantum information processing and communication. The review covers various types of quantum light sources, including single-photon emitters, entangled photon sources, and quantum-dot lasers. The authors also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in achieving efficient and scalable quantum light sources. Remarkable findings include the recent advancements in developing on-demand single-photon sources and the use of entangled photon sources in quantum key distribution. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future outlook of semiconductor quantum light sources and their impact on quantum technologies.
1354	"The research paper titled ""Interactions and star formation activity in Wolf-Rayet galaxies"" explores the relationship between interactions of galaxies and the star formation activity in Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies. The study uses multi-wavelength observations of 54 WR galaxies to analyze their star formation and interaction history. The results indicate that WR galaxies with higher interaction strength have higher star formation rates and more compact star-forming regions. Additionally, the study finds that WR galaxies with multiple nuclei and tidal tails exhibit more vigorous star formation activity. The findings suggest that interactions play a significant role in triggering star formation in WR galaxies, and the presence of multiple nuclei and tidal tails can enhance this process. Overall, the study highlights the importance of galaxy interactions in shaping the star formation activity in WR galaxies."
2460	We report on FUSE spectra of three U Gem-type, long period, dwarf novae, UU Aql, BV Cen and CH UMa taken during their quiescence intervals. We discuss the line identifications in their spectra and attempt to characterize the source(s) of their FUV flux distribution. Archival IUE spectrum of CH UMa and BV Cen in quiescence were identified as having a matching flux level with the FUSE spectra and these were combined with each FUSE spectrum to broaden the wavelength coverage and further constrain model fits. Multi-component synthetic spectral fits from our model grids, consisting of single temperature white dwarfs, two-temperature white dwarfs, accretion disks and white dwarfs plus accretion disks, were applied to the FUSE spectra alone and to the combined FUSE + IUE spectra. We present the results of our model analyses and their implications.
D2-57	"In modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.  The experiment poses the question, ""when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?"" (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox."
664	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of over-reflection and the generation of Gravito-Alfven waves in solar-type stars. Through numerical simulations and analysis of observational data, we show that over-reflection can occur in the outer layers of the stars, leading to the formation of Gravito-Alfven waves. These waves can play an important role in the dynamics and energy transport of the stellar atmosphere. We also discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the evolution and activity of solar-type stars. Our results suggest that Gravito-Alfven waves may be a common feature of these stars and could be a key factor in the heating of their outer atmospheres.
D2-85	A PET scan, or Positron Emission Tomography, is a sophisticated imaging technique used in healthcare to visualize the metabolic processes within the body. It involves the injection of a radioactive tracer, often a glucose analog, into the patient. As the tracer interacts with body tissues, it emits positrons, which collide with electrons, resulting in the release of gamma rays. These emissions are detected by the PET scanner, which constructs a detailed image showing the distribution and activity of the tracer within the body. Unlike structural imaging methods such as CT scans or MRIs, a PET scan provides functional information, highlighting areas of high metabolic activity. This makes it particularly valuable in diagnosing and assessing conditions like cancer, heart disease,  neurological disorders.
3611	This research paper aims to investigate the tracking of user attention in collaborative tagging communities. Collaborative tagging is a process where users collectively assign tags to content, such as images or web pages, to organize and classify them. The focus of this study is to explore how user attention can be monitored and analyzed in these communities, specifically examining the factors that influence user attention and the impact of user attention on the quality of tagging and user engagement. The research will employ a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The findings of this research will contribute to the understanding of user behavior and engagement in collaborative tagging communities and inform the development of tools to improve the effectiveness of tagging systems.
3242	This research paper aims to investigate the emergence of universal properties in rank distributions by exploring the algebraic basis of the beta-like function. The study utilizes mathematical models and analytical tools to examine the relationship between the beta-like function and tail universalities in rank distributions. The paper highlights the significance of the beta-like function as a basis for understanding the underlying algebraic structure of power-law distributions. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that govern the emergence of universal properties in complex systems and provide insights into the mathematical foundations of power-law distributions. Overall, this study sheds light on the algebraic problem of tail universalities in rank distributions and presents the beta-like function as a potential solution.
1795	We investigate the mixing-demixing transition and the collapse in a quasi-two-dimensional degenerate boson-fermion mixture (DBFM) with a bosonic vortex. We solve numerically a quantum-hydrodynamic model based on a new density functional which accurately takes into account the dimensional crossover. It is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion, a mixed state of DBFM could turn into a demixed state. The system collapses for interspecies attraction above a critical value which depends on the vortex quantum number. For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit there is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components. Such mixed and demixed states of a DBFM could be experimentally realized by varying an external magnetic field near a boson-fermion Feshbach resonance, which will result in a continuous variation of interspecies interaction.
3459	We apply a model for sand dunes to calculate formation of dunes on Mars under the present Martian atmospheric conditions. We find that different dune shapes as those imaged by Mars Global Surveyor could have been formed by the action of sand-moving winds occuring on today's Mars. Our calculations show, however, that Martian dunes could be only formed due to the higher efficiency of Martian winds in carrying grains into saltation. The model equations are solved to study saltation transport under different atmospheric conditions valid for Mars. We obtain an estimate for the wind speed and migration velocity of barchan dunes at different places on Mars. From comparison with the shape of bimodal sand dunes, we find an estimate for the timescale of the changes in Martian wind regimes.
3366	This paper presents a study on the spin-exchange collisions of submerged shell atoms below 1 Kelvin. We investigate the interaction between two atoms in a cold gas, focusing on the exchange of their magnetic moments. The experimental setup employs a magnetic trap to confine a cloud of ultracold atoms and a radio-frequency technique to measure the spin-exchange rates. Our results show that the spin-exchange cross-section decreases as the temperature decreases, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction. We also observed that the collisional relaxation time increases as the density of the gas decreases. Our findings have important implications for the development of quantum computing and atomic clocks.
3238	This research paper investigates the Modified Brans-Dicke (MBD) theory of gravity derived from five-dimensional vacuum. The study analyzes the impact of the additional dimension on the scalar field of the MBD theory and derives the corresponding field equations. Our results reveal that the additional dimension's effect leads to the emergence of an additional scalar field, which influences the dynamics of gravity. The analysis reveals that the theory's predictions are consistent with the current experimental data. Furthermore, the study shows that the MBD theory can provide an alternative explanation for the dark matter and dark energy problems. The outcomes of this research have significant implications for the understanding of gravity and the universe's evolution.
1408	This research paper delves into the 1874 controversy between the French mathematician Camille Jordan and the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker. At the heart of the debate was the question of the foundations of mathematics, specifically the use of infinite sets and their role in mathematical reasoning. Jordan argued for the validity of infinite sets and their importance in mathematical analysis, while Kronecker maintained that only finite sets and their operations should be considered legitimate in mathematics. The paper examines the arguments made by both mathematicians and the broader implications of this controversy for the development of mathematics in the late 19th century. Ultimately, the paper suggests that the debate between Jordan and Kronecker highlights the tension between the abstract and concrete approaches to mathematics, a tension that continues to shape mathematical inquiry today.
1959	We study the consequences of CPT and lepton number violation in neutrino sector. For CPT violation we take gravity with which neutrino and antineutrino couple differently. Gravity mixes neutrino and antineutrino in an unequal ratio to give two mass eigenstates. Lepton number violation interaction together with CPT violation gives rise to neutrino-antineutrino oscillation. Subsequently, we study the neutrino flavor mixing and oscillation under the influence of gravity. It is found that gravity changes flavor oscillation significantly which influences the relative abundance of different flavors in present universe. We show that the neutrinoless double beta decay rate is modified due to presence of gravity- the origin of CPT violation, as the mass of the flavor state is modified.
562	We present two theoretical schemes for spin filters in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as well as weak magnetic potential. For case I, the SOC is periodic and the weak magnetic potential is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy intervals. For case II, the weak magnetic potential is periodic while the SOC is uniform. An ideal negative/positive switching effect for spin polarization is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, magnetic potential, and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed.
240	This research paper investigates the ongoing process of galactic accretion, which involves the accumulation of gas and other materials into galaxies. Specifically, the paper focuses on simulations and observations of condensed gas in hot halos, which are the regions surrounding galaxies. Through computer simulations and observations, the study aims to shed light on the mechanisms that drive gas accretion in hot halos and the ways in which this process contributes to the growth and evolution of galaxies. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as for theories of dark matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.
3014	This research paper examines the collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market. The main objective of this study is to investigate the existence and strength of the collective behavior among stocks in the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), Pakistan. Using daily stock returns data spanning from January 2001 to December 2017, we apply the network-based methodology to analyze the interdependence and synchronization of stock returns. Our findings reveal that the KSE exhibits strong collective behavior, indicating that stock prices are highly interdependent and synchronized. Moreover, our analysis shows that this collective behavior is affected by external shocks, such as political instability and economic crises. These findings have important implications for investors, policymakers, and regulators who seek to understand the dynamics of the emerging market and develop effective investment strategies.

Moreover, the study concludes that the use of batch processing can improve the system performance and reduce the response time, especially for large batch sizes and high utilization levels.

The study concludes that the flow of information plays a crucial role in asset pricing and that investors who possess superior information have a significant advantage in financial markets. The research also highlights the importance of developing effective strategies for acquiring and analyzing information to make informed investment decisions."

Additionally, robotics fosters 21st-century skills like adaptability, perseverance, and communication.
3208	This research paper investigates the particle number requirements for simulating bar-halo friction in galaxies. Bar-halo friction is a phenomenon in which the bar structure of a galaxy interacts with its dark matter halo, causing the rotation of the bar to slow down. The study uses numerical simulations to explore the effects of varying the number of particles in the simulation on the accuracy of the results. The results of the study suggest that a higher number of particles in the simulation is required to accurately capture the effects of bar-halo friction, particularly in galaxies with a low-mass halo. These findings have implications for future simulations of galaxy evolution and provide insight into the complex interactions between the various components of galaxies.
1204	Using a general Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian, we study the topological structure and low-lying collective modes of dense QCD having both chiral and diquark condensates, for two and three massless flavors. As we found earlier, the QCD axial anomaly acts as an external field applied to the chiral condensate in a color superconductor and, as a new critical point emerges, leads to a crossover between the broken chiral symmetry and color superconducting phases. At intermediate densities where both chiral and diquark condensates are present, we derive a generalized Gell-Mann- Oakes-Renner relation between the masses of pseudoscalar bosons and the magnitude of the chiral and diquark-condensates. We show explicitly the continuity of the ordinary pion at low densities to a generalized pion at high densities.
278	We construct a family of equations of state within a quasiparticle model by relating pressure, energy density, baryon density and susceptibilities adjusted to first-principles lattice QCD calculations. The relation between pressure and energy density from lattice QCD is surprisingly insensitive to details of the simulations. Effects from different lattice actions, quark masses and lattice spacings used in the simulations show up mostly in the quark-hadron phase transition region which we bridge over by a set of interpolations to a hadron resonance gas equation of state. Within our optimized quasiparticle model we then examine the equation of state along isentropic expansion trajectories at small net baryon densities, as relevant for experiments and hydrodynamic simulations at RHIC and LHC energies. We illustrate its impact on azimuthal flow anisotropies and transverse momentum spectra of various hadron species.
2909	I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans. I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.
4035	We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions. Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the driving fields.
D2-43	Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. . In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from.
D2-13	Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.
2933	The Painleve VI equation is a nonlinear differential equation with applications in various fields of physics and mathematics. In this research paper, we explore the finite branch solutions to Painleve VI around a fixed singular point. We investigate the behavior of the solutions near the singular point and analyze the different branches that emerge. We also examine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions and their connection with the Riemann-Hilbert problem. We use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, including the method of Frobenius and the numerical shooting method, to obtain our results. Our findings shed light on the complex dynamics of the Painleve VI equation and contribute to the understanding of its solutions in the vicinity of singular points. This research has implications for the study of integrable systems and their applications in physics and mathematics.
3360	This research paper explores the concept of inflated beta distributions, which are probability distributions that have an excess of observations at either end of the distribution. The main focus of the study is to provide a comprehensive overview of inflated beta distributions and their properties, including moments, skewness, and kurtosis. The paper also examines the application of inflated beta distributions in modeling empirical data, such as financial returns and the likelihood of extreme events. The crucial finding of this study is that inflated beta distributions are useful for modeling data with heavy tails and provide a better fit than traditional beta distributions. The conclusion of the paper is that inflated beta distributions offer a flexible and powerful tool for modeling complex data and should be considered by researchers and practitioners in various fields.

2476	This research paper explores the concept of the plasma puddle as a perturbative black hole, which has been observed in laboratory experiments. The primary focus of the study is to understand the physics behind this phenomenon and the potential implications for our understanding of black holes. The paper presents important discoveries, including the fact that the plasma puddle exhibits similar properties to black holes in terms of its gravitational pull and event horizon. The conclusion of the study highlights the potential for the plasma puddle to serve as a useful tool for studying black holes and advancing our knowledge of the universe.
3035	We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale, nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation.
D1-1	The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
2730	We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.
2217	This research paper focuses on the fairness provision in the IEEE 802.11e infrastructure basic service set (IBSS). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the fairness provision mechanism in ensuring fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The research was conducted through simulations using the Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) tool. The results showed that the fairness provision mechanism effectively ensures fair channel access for all stations in the IBSS. The study also found that the fairness provision mechanism is effective in reducing channel contention and increasing the overall throughput of the IBSS. The paper concludes that the fairness provision mechanism is a crucial component of the IEEE 802.11e standard and should be implemented in all IBSS networks to ensure fair channel access for all stations.
2236	We consider decay of phonon condensate into phonons at photodissociation of the strong coupling large polaron (SCLP), when the charge carrier becomes free. Expression to calculate the band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of SCLP is obtained. The band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of strong-coupling large-radius polarons is a broad band with the shape determined by Poisson distribution. It can be structured or unstructured depending on the phonon dispersion since a distance between neighbouring lines comprising the band is the phonon energy. Half-width of the band is in the interval 1.3 - 1.7Ep, depending on the phonon energy. The band maximum is situated approximately at the electron energy Ephot-W-3.2Ep (where Ephot is the photon energy, W is work function), and its position does not depend on the electron wave vector direction.
D2-14	Molecular data on relationships within angiosperms confirm the view that their increasing morphological diversity through the Cretaceous reflected their evolutionary radiation. Despite the early appearance of aquatics and groups with simple flowers, the record is consistent with inferences from molecular trees that the first angiosperms were woody plants with pinnately veined leaves, multiparted flowers, uniovulate ascidiate carpels, and columellar monosulcate pollen. Molecular data appear to refute the hypothesis based on morphology that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living relatives. Morphological analyses of living and fossil seed plants that assume molecular relationships identify glossopterids, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as angiosperm relatives; these results are consistent with proposed homologies between the cupule of glossopterids and Caytonia and the angiosperm bitegmic ovule.
2529	We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation. Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.
1212	This research paper delves into the question of whether there are any cross-interactions between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field. The study uses mathematical models to explore the theoretical possibilities of such interactions and analyzes experimental data to determine if they exist in the physical world. The results of this research have implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature and provide insights into the behavior of quantum particles. Ultimately, this study sheds light on a complex and important topic in the field of physics and contributes to the ongoing quest for a unified theory of everything.
3578	The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since more than twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on which are based the best known attacks against the lattice-based encryption schemes mentioned above. Understanding precisely Kannan's algorithm is of prime importance for providing meaningful key-sizes. In this paper we improve the complexity analyses of Kannan's algorithms and discuss the possibility of improving the underlying enumeration strategy.
2083	This research paper investigates the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions, specifically the distribution of particles produced in the collision and their correlation with the orientation of the collision. Using experimental data from high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, we analyze the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production and identify various effects that contribute to the observed patterns. Our results suggest that the azimuth structure of nuclear collisions is a powerful tool for probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter that existed in the early universe. Ultimately, this research contributes to our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and has implications for the study of heavy-ion collisions in astrophysics and cosmology.
1420	This research paper presents an experimental study on Decoy Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) up to 130KM fiber. The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using decoy states for long-distance QKD and to evaluate the key generation rate and the security of the system. The experimental setup is based on a continuous-wave laser source, a fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a photon detector. The results show that the decoy QKD protocol can achieve a key generation rate of 0.07 bits per pulse and a secure key rate of 0.02 bits per pulse at 130KM fiber. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the decoy-state method in mitigating photon number splitting attacks. Overall, the experimental decoy QKD system provides a promising solution for secure key distribution over long distances.
3580	We study infinite tree and ultrametric matrices, and their action on the boundary of the tree. For each tree matrix we show the existence of a symmetric random walk associated to it and we study its Green potential. We provide a representation theorem for harmonic functions that includes simple expressions for any increasing harmonic function and the Martin kernel. In the boundary, we construct the Markov kernel whose Green function is the extension of the matrix and we simulate it by using a cascade of killing independent exponential random variables and conditionally independent uniform variables. For ultrametric matrices we supply probabilistic conditions to study its potential properties when immersed in its minimal tree matrix extension.
2511	This research paper presents a simulation of four-body interaction in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processor. The study aims to investigate the feasibility of using NMR for quantum information processing with four-body interactions. The simulation considered the effects of the J-coupling interaction, dipolar interaction, and chemical shift anisotropy on the system. The results showed that four-body interactions can be achieved through careful manipulation of the system parameters, such as the pulse sequence and the strength of the magnetic field. The study also highlights the importance of minimizing decoherence effects and optimizing the control parameters for successful implementation of four-body interactions. Overall, the research suggests that NMR is a promising platform for implementing four-body interactions in quantum information processing and provides insights for future experimental studies in this area.
3249	We examine resonances for two systems consisting of a particle coupled to a massless boson's field. The field is the free field in the whole space. In the first system, the particle is confined inside a ball. We show that besides the usual energy levels of the particle, which have become complex through the coupling to the field, other resonances are to be taken into account if the ball's radius is comparable to the particle's Compton wavelength. In the second system, the particle is in a finite-depth square-well potential. We study the way the resonances' width depends on the extent of the uncoupled particle's wave functions. In both cases, we limit ourselves to considering two levels of the particle only.
3981	"The research paper titled ""Finite Drude weight for 1D low temperature conductors"" explores the concept of Drude weight in one-dimensional (1D) conductors at low temperatures. The Drude weight is a measure of the electrical conductivity of a material, and in this study, the researchers focus on how it behaves in 1D conductors with low temperatures. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Drude weight and its finite values in 1D conductors, which is in contrast to the infinite value in higher dimensions. The paper concludes that the Drude weight in 1D conductors is not only finite but can also be tuned by changing the temperature and the strength of the interactions between the electrons. This study provides insights into the behavior of 1D conductors at low temperatures and could have implications for the design of future electronic devices."
600	In this paper we review the applicability of autofluorescent proteins for single-molecule imaging in biology. The photophysical characteristics of several mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and those of DsRed are compared and critically discussed for their use in cellular biology. The alternative use of two-photon excitation at the single-molecule level or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is envisaged for the study of individual autofluorescent proteins. Single-molecule experiments performed in live cells using eGFP and preferably eYFP fusion proteins are reviewed. Finally, the first use at the single-molecule level of citrine, a more photostable variant of the eYFP is reported when fused to a receptor for neurotransmitter in live cells.
3486	We have recently pointed out that color magnetic field is generated in dense quark matter, i.e. color ferromagnetic phase of quark matter. Using light cone quantization, we show that gluons occupying the lowest Landau level under the color magnetic field effectively form a two dimensional quantum well (layer), in which infinitely many zero modes of the gluons are present. We discuss that the zero modes of the gluons form a quantum Hall state by interacting repulsively with each other, just as electrons do in semiconductors. Such a ferromagnetic quark matter with the layer structure of the gluons is a possible origin of extremely strong magnetic field observed in magnetars.
3489	This research paper presents a new discrete computer network model with expanding dimensions. The model captures the growth of a network over time, allowing for the addition of new nodes and edges as the network expands. The model is based on a dynamic graph structure and includes a set of rules for adding new nodes and edges. We conduct experiments to validate the model and demonstrate its ability to capture the dynamics of real-world networks. We also derive a set of theoretical results, including the degree distribution and clustering coefficient, which can be used to analyze the properties of the network as it expands. Our results show that the model accurately captures the behavior of real-world networks, and provides a useful tool for studying the growth and evolution of complex systems.
2651	This research paper explores the Mpemba effect and phase transitions in the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing. The Mpemba effect is a phenomenon where hot water freezes faster than cold water under certain conditions. Adiabatic cooling, on the other hand, is the cooling of a substance without heat transfer to or from the surroundings. This study investigates the relationship between these two phenomena by examining the phase transitions that occur during the adiabatic cooling of water before freezing. The paper presents experimental data and theoretical models to explain the Mpemba effect and the phase transitions that occur in water as it cools. The findings of this study may have implications for various fields, including materials science, thermodynamics, and climatology.

1241	For general quantum systems the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions in relation to the ergodic properties of the underlying classical system is quite difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way, thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set of quantum limits in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as quantum limits, and examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely continuous ergodic measures can occur as quantum limits. The maps we quantise are obtained by cutting and stacking.
2575	We report CCD photometry and spectroscopy during 2006 outburst of the dwarf nova SDSS J102146.44+234926.3 (SDSS J1021). The photographic plates from the MAO, SAI and CrAO plate archives, which cover the position of the SDSS J1021, were inspected for the presence of previous outbursts. We also present the BVRcIc photometric calibration of 52 stars in SDSS J1021 vicinity, which have V-magnitude in the range of 11.21-17.23m and can serve as comparison stars. The large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this object as a WZ Sge type dwarf nova.
1573	This research paper provides a gentle introduction to the combinatorial techniques used in boson normal ordering. Normal ordering is a crucial tool in quantum mechanics, and the combinatorial methods used in this paper can simplify calculations significantly. The paper explores various combinatorial techniques, such as generating functions, partitions, and Young tableaux, to derive normal ordered expressions for various bosonic systems. The primary finding of this paper is that combinatorics can be a powerful tool to simplify boson normal ordering, leading to more efficient calculations. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of combinatorial techniques in quantum mechanics and suggesting avenues for further research in this area.
D2-61	Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.
1641	This research paper focuses on the characterization of instrumental phase stability, which is an important factor in signal processing applications such as radar and communication systems. The study involves the use of a set of measurement techniques to determine the phase stability of a signal generator. The results show that the phase stability of the generator is affected by various factors such as temperature, frequency, and power level. The findings suggest that the phase stability of the generator can be improved by reducing the influence of these factors. The study concludes that the characterization of instrumental phase stability is crucial for the accurate and reliable operation of signal processing systems.
2677	This research paper focuses on the application of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the momentum distributions of non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) in strong laser fields. Specifically, the product phase approximation is utilized to calculate the momentum distributions of the two electrons that are ionized simultaneously. The results suggest that the product phase approximation can accurately capture the NSDI momentum distributions and that the momentum correlations between the two electrons play a crucial role in shaping the distributions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the NSDI process and highlights the importance of considering electron-electron correlations in TDDFT calculations.
215	The paper investigates the distribution of entropy production for a colloidal particle in a nonequilibrium steady state. The authors use a stochastic thermodynamics approach to model the system and derive the probability density function of entropy production. They find that the distribution of entropy production is non-Gaussian and can be described by a power law. Additionally, they show that the mean entropy production is proportional to the applied force, providing insight into the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states. Overall, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems and may have important implications for the design of nanoscale devices.
36	This research paper investigates the existence and properties of non-topological solitons in field theories with kinetic self-coupling. Such solitons are localized, stable configurations of the field that do not rely on topological considerations for their stability. The study is conducted by solving the equations of motion for the field and analyzing the resulting solutions. The paper explores the conditions under which non-topological solitons can arise and examines their properties, such as their energy, size, and stability. The results of this research can have significant implications for various fields of physics, including particle physics and condensed matter physics.
2189	The research paper discusses the determination of the equation of state for atomic systems beyond s-wave using the lowest order constrained variational method. The study focuses on the large scattering length limit, where the system exhibits universal behavior. The researchers develop an improved method for calculating the equation of state, which allows them to accurately predict the properties of the system in this regime. The results show that the equation of state is highly sensitive to the details of the interaction potential, with different potentials leading to different results. The study provides important insights into the behavior of atomic systems beyond s-wave and highlights the need for accurate interaction potentials in determining their properties.
527	Recent progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model the non-perturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. Based on these results, we propose a phenomenological family of waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of black hole coalescence. We also construct a template bank using this family of waveforms and discuss its implementation in the search for signatures of gravitational waves produced by black-hole coalescences in the data of ground-based interferometers. This template bank might enable us to extend the present inspiral searches to higher-mass binary black-hole systems, i.e., systems with total mass greater than about 80 solar masses, thereby increasing the reach of the current generation of ground-based detectors.
3485	"The research paper titled ""Preferential Detachment in Broadcast Signaling Networks: Connectivity and Cost Trade-off"" investigates how the preferential attachment mechanism affects the connectivity and cost of broadcast signaling networks. The study uses simulations to model the network growth process and evaluate its impact on network structure. The main finding of the study is that preferential attachment can lead to high connectivity but also increases the cost of maintaining the network. The paper suggests that a balance between connectivity and cost is necessary to optimize the network's performance. The study's conclusion highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern network growth to design efficient and effective broadcast signaling networks."
2324	This research paper presents a study on the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices at non-zero temperatures. The primary focus is on investigating the effects of temperature on the decay of superfluid turbulence. The study utilized numerical simulations and analytical calculations to explore the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices. The remarkable findings include the prediction of a critical temperature for the onset of the decay of superfluid turbulence and the observation of a decrease in vortex line density with increasing temperature. The conclusions suggest that temperature plays a critical role in the dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices and should be considered in future studies of superfluid turbulence.
3676	We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.
3300	Hydrocarbon anions have been detected in various interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes, providing important insights into the chemical processes occurring in these environments. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the detection, properties, and formation mechanisms of hydrocarbon anions in interstellar clouds and circumstellar envelopes. Theoretical and experimental studies of the structures and reactivity of these anions are discussed, with a particular focus on their potential roles in the formation of larger organic molecules. The implications of these findings for our understanding of the origin of life and the evolution of planetary systems are also considered. Overall, the detection of hydrocarbon anions in these environments highlights the richness and complexity of interstellar chemistry and underscores the importance of continued research in this field.
3198	This research paper investigates the effects of a confining potential on anisotropic brane gravity. The study shows that the confining potential leads to a non-linear dependence of the gravitational field on the brane's tension, resulting in a modified Friedmann equation that predicts a modified expansion history of the universe. The research also highlights the emergence of a cosmic bounce scenario, where the universe contracts and then expands again. The critical outcome of this study is the possibility of explaining the observed cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. The results of this research have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of the universe and may offer new insights into the nature of gravity.
2486	This research paper explores the intriguing relationship between information, information processing, and gravity. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether gravity influences the processing of information and the communication of information between individuals. The study examines existing theories on the role of gravity in information processing and communication, and analyzes empirical evidence related to the topic. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods, to gather and analyze data. The findings suggest that gravity may influence information processing and communication, particularly in situations where there are significant changes in gravitational forces. The study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the relationship between information, information processing, and gravity and highlights the need for further research in this area.
D1-10	Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are three fundamental principles that describe the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, building on the detailed observations of the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Kepler’s work came at a time when the heliocentric model (Sun-centered solar system) proposed by Copernicus was still controversial. Kepler initially struggled with the Copernican model, but after inheriting Brahe’s precise astronomical data, he was able to make groundbreaking discoveries. Kepler’s first law, the Law of Ellipses, stated that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The second, the Law of Equal Areas, explained that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times.
699	We give a one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) capable of simulating all others. By this we mean that the initial configuration and the local transition rule of any one-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the initial configuration of the universal QCA. Several steps of the universal QCA will then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA. The simulation preserves the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. The encoding is linear and hence does not carry any of the cost of the computation. We do this in two flavours: a weak one which requires an infinite but periodic initial configuration and a strong one which needs only a finite initial configuration. KEYWORDS: Quantum cellular automata, Intrinsic universality, Quantum computation.
1275	This research paper presents the findings of a multi-epoch VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) study of the radio galaxy 3C 66A. The central focus of the study was to investigate the variability and structural changes in the jet of 3C 66A over a period of six years. The results show that the jet underwent significant morphological changes, including the appearance of a new component and the disappearance of an existing component. These findings suggest that the variability in 3C 66A is likely due to the propagation of shocks along the jet. The study highlights the importance of multi-epoch VLBA observations in understanding the dynamics of active galactic nuclei.
286	We elucidate how black holes form in trans-Planckian collisions. In the rest frame of one of the incident particles, the gravitational field of the other, which is rapidly moving, looks like a gravitational shock wave. The shock wave focuses the target particle down to a much smaller impact parameter. In turn, the gravitational field of the target particle captures the projectile when the resultant impact parameter is smaller than its own Schwarzschild radius, forming a black hole. One can deduce this by referring to the original argument of escape velocities exceeding the speed of light, which Michell and Laplace used to discover the existence of black holes.
1721	"This research paper titled ""Fundamentalist physics: why Dark Energy is bad for Astronomy"" argues that the concept of Dark Energy, a theoretical form of energy that explains the accelerating expansion of the universe, is problematic for astronomy. The authors contend that the existence of Dark Energy is based on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, which may not be a valid assumption. They further argue that the use of Dark Energy as a fundamental concept in physics limits our ability to explore alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. The paper concludes that the field of astronomy needs to be more open to alternative theories and perspectives to advance our understanding of the universe."
564	We review the possibility that metallicity could provide a diagnostic for the age of a galaxy, hence that the most metal-poor star forming galaxies in the local universe may be genuinely young. Indeed, observational evidence for downsizing shows the average age of the stars in a galaxy to decrease with decreasing mass and metallicity. However, we conclude both from observational and theoretical viewpoints that metallicity is not an arrow of time. Consequently the most metal poor galaxies of our local universe are not necessarely young. Current observations suggest that an old stellar population is present in all metal-poor galaxies, although a couple of cases, e.g. IZw18, remain under debate. Further observations with more sentitive equipement should settle this question in the coming years.
1773	"The research paper titled ""Transition on the entropic elasticity of DNA induced by intercalating molecules"" investigates the effect of intercalating molecules on the entropic elasticity of DNA. The study utilized single-molecule stretching experiments and statistical mechanics analysis to show that intercalation induces a transition in the entropic elasticity of DNA. The results indicate that the intercalation of molecules alters the conformational entropy of DNA and affects its mechanical properties. The findings of the study have implications for the design and development of intercalating molecules for use in DNA-based technologies. Overall, the research provides insights into the fundamental nature of DNA mechanics and the role of intercalation in modulating its properties."
1805	We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types, through correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star formation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions, but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.
3447	The phonon dynamics in a one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain coupled to finite-frequency bond phonons is studied. We present the first detailed phonon spectra for these systems using Quantum Monte Carlo. The quantum phase transition is dominated by a central peak, yet the renormalisation of the main phonon branch depends strongly on the bare phonon frequency omega_0. The main branch remains largely unaffected at omega_0 \gsim J, but it softens completely when omega_0 is low enough. This is an unusual scenario for a structural phase transition and was observable only on sufficiently large systems. Approaching the dimerized phase from finite temperature, the lattice dynamics mirrors the behavior of a three dimensional system. For the efficient measurement of Greens functions, we introduce a mapping from the stochastic series expansion to continuous imaginary time.
2564	There is a huge amount of historical documents in libraries and in various National Archives that have not been exploited electronically. Although automatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term objective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication and extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to aging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open research field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing methods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of historical interest.
720	This research paper presents a detailed analysis of the Takagi-Taupin description of X-ray dynamical diffraction from diffractive optics with large numerical aperture. The study focuses on the fundamental understanding of the interaction of X-rays with diffractive optics and the resulting diffraction patterns. The paper provides a theoretical framework for modeling the diffraction process and analyzes the effects of various parameters such as the numerical aperture, the thickness of the diffractive optics, and the incident beam profile. The results show that the Takagi-Taupin description provides an accurate and comprehensive solution for the X-ray dynamical diffraction from diffractive optics with large numerical aperture. The paper concludes that this approach can be used to optimize the performance of diffractive optics and improve their applications in X-ray imaging, spectroscopy, and other fields.
2484	This research paper investigates the generation of curvature perturbations in the context of a multiple field ekpyrotic collapse. The main objective is to explore how the dynamics of the fields within this model affects the power spectrum of the generated perturbations. The study uses a scalar field theory and employs the delta N formalism to calculate the curvature perturbations. The results indicate that the presence of multiple fields can lead to a significant enhancement of the power spectrum, particularly at small scales. Additionally, the study finds that the introduction of a non-minimal coupling between the fields can further amplify the perturbations. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early universe and the generation of primordial perturbations.
2377	"The research paper titled ""Magnetosonic solitons in a Fermionic quantum plasma"" explores the formation and behavior of magnetosonic solitons in a quantum plasma consisting of fermions. The study is based on theoretical calculations and simulations using the quantum hydrodynamic equations. The research found that the presence of fermions in the plasma has a significant impact on the formation and propagation of magnetosonic solitons. The results showed that the solitons have a lower amplitude and a wider distribution compared to those in a classical plasma. Additionally, the solitons exhibit particle-like behavior, suggesting that they can be considered as quasiparticles in the quantum plasma. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of magnetosonic solitons in quantum plasmas and could have implications for future research in areas such as astrophysics and fusion energy."
1886	Superfluid 3He-A shares the properties of spin nematic and chiral orbital ferromagnet. Its order parameter is characterized by two vectors d and l. This doubly anisotropic superfluid, when it is confined in aerogel, represents the most interesting example of a system with continuous symmetry in the presence of random anisotropy disorder. We discuss the Larkin-Imry-Ma state, which is characterized by the short-range orientational order of the vector l, while the long-range orientational order is destroyed by the collective action of the randomly oriented aerogel strings. On the other hand, sufficiently large regular anisotropy produced either by the deformation of the aerogel or by applied superflow suppresses the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect leading to the uniform orientation of the vector l. This interplay of regular and random anisotropy allows us to study many different effects.
800	This research paper presents a new method for calculating the beta function of large-N QCD_4 using the holographic loop equation. The authors derive an exact expression for the beta function, which describes how the coupling constant of the theory changes as a function of energy scale. The results suggest that the beta function has a non-trivial fixed point, which is important for understanding the behavior of the theory at high energies. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for the holographic duality between gravity and QCD_4. Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to our understanding of large-N QCD_4 and its holographic dual.
1361	We report on the realization of a multi-orbital system with ultracold atoms in the excited bands of a 3D optical lattice by selectively controlling the band population along a given lattice direction. The lifetime of the atoms in the excited band is found to be considerably longer (10-100 times) than the characteristic time scale for inter-site tunneling, thus opening the path for orbital selective many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Upon exciting the atoms from an initial lowest band Mott insulating state to higher lying bands, we observe the dynamical emergence of coherence in 1D (and 2D), compatible with Bose-Einstein condensation to a non-zero momentum state.
3734	This research paper investigates the growth of single-crystal Al2O3 layers on Nb (110) thin films through a layer-by-layer deposition process. The primary theme of the study is to explore the impact of strain on the growth of Al2O3 on Nb (110) thin films and its electronic properties. The essential findings of the study suggest that the strained Al2O3 layers exhibit a unique electronic structure, with the formation of new electronic states near the Fermi level. The study also highlights the potential of strained Al2O3/Nb (110) thin films for the development of novel electronic devices and future applications in the field of materials science.
1681	This research paper explores the concept of squashed entanglement for multipartite quantum states and proposes a method for calculating entanglement measures based on the mixed convex roof. The research finds that squashed entanglement is a useful tool for characterizing the entanglement structure of multipartite systems and provides insight into the behavior of entanglement measures in different scenarios. Additionally, the proposed method for calculating entanglement measures based on the mixed convex roof is shown to be effective in producing accurate results. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of entanglement in multipartite quantum systems and provides a framework for future investigations into this field.
1340	This research paper aims to investigate the systematics of the threshold incident energy for deep sub-barrier fusion hindrance. The study involves the analysis of experimental data obtained from various fusion reactions. The aim is to identify the factors that contribute to the hindrance effect in deep sub-barrier fusion and to determine the threshold energy required for fusion to occur. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data and discusses the implications of the findings for our understanding of nuclear fusion processes. The results of this study have significant implications for the development of new fusion technologies and for our understanding of the behavior of nuclear systems at low energies.
896	Kernel-based nonparametric hazard rate estimation is considered with a special class of infinite-order kernels that achieves favorable bias and mean square error properties. A fully automatic and adaptive implementation of a density and hazard rate estimator is proposed for randomly right censored data. Careful selection of the bandwidth in the proposed estimators yields estimates that are more efficient in terms of overall mean squared error performance, and in some cases achieves a nearly parametric convergence rate. Additionally, rapidly converging bandwidth estimates are presented for use in second-order kernels to supplement such kernel-based methods in hazard rate estimation. Simulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator against other nonparametric estimators of the density and hazard function. A real data application is also presented on survival data from 13,166 breast carcinoma patients.
1256	This research paper focuses on the semiclassical theory of ballistic transport through chaotic cavities with spin-orbit interaction. The study investigates the impact of spin-orbit interaction on transport properties in chaotic cavities, which are known for their complex dynamics and are of great interest in the field of nanoelectronics. The results indicate that spin-orbit interaction can significantly modify the transport properties, leading to new phenomena such as weak localization and spin Hall effect. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the spin transport properties in chaotic systems, which has potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Overall, the research contributes to the understanding of the fundamental physics of spin transport in nanoscale systems and has implications for the development of novel devices based on spintronics.
2771	The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.
2830	The research paper explores the generic representations of orthogonal groups using projective functors in the category Fquad. The authors introduce a new construction of the category Fquad, which allows for a better understanding of the representation theory of orthogonal groups. They demonstrate that the projective functors in Fquad give rise to generic representations of orthogonal groups and provide explicit formulas for these representations. The paper also discusses the properties of the projective functors and their connections to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and topology. The results obtained in this paper are important for the study of algebraic groups and their representations, as well as for applications in physics and other areas of mathematics.
2330	"The research paper titled ""Some notes on analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds"" discusses the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds. The Rumin complex is an important tool in the study of contact geometry and topology. The paper investigates the properties of the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex and establishes a formula for its computation. The main subject of the paper is the study of the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds. The key findings of the paper include the establishment of a formula for the computation of the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex and the analysis of its properties. The paper concludes that the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex is a useful tool in the study of contact geometry and topology."
2051	In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons, forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.
526	This research paper investigates the effects of frequency correlation in a linear optical entangling gate operated with independent photons. The study focuses on exploring the impact of frequency correlations on the entanglement generation process in a linear optical system. The experimental results show that frequency correlations significantly affect the performance of the entangling gate, leading to improved entanglement generation. The study concludes that the frequency correlation is a critical factor in the design and operation of linear optical entangling gates, and optimizing it can enhance the efficiency of quantum information processing. This research contributes to the understanding of the fundamentals of quantum information processing and provides valuable insights into the development of practical quantum computing technologies.
1191	This research paper aims to investigate the intrinsic origin of spin echoes in dipolar solids generated by strong pi pulses. The study focuses on the behavior of spin echoes in dipolar systems, which are known to exhibit complex dynamics due to the long-range interactions between spins. The research uses a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental measurements to explore the relationship between the strength of the pi pulse and the resulting spin echo signal. The results show that the intrinsic properties of the dipolar solid, such as the spin-spin coupling strength and the distribution of dipolar couplings, play a crucial role in the generation of spin echoes. Understanding the intrinsic origin of spin echoes in dipolar solids has important implications for the development of new techniques in solid-state NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.
3046	Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.
496	This research paper focuses on the absorption spectroscopy of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The paper presents a comprehensive study of the electronic properties and spectroscopic characteristics of individual SWCNTs, using a combination of optical spectroscopy and numerical simulations. The results reveal that the absorption spectra of SWCNTs are highly dependent on their diameter and chirality, and can be used as a powerful tool for their characterization and identification. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential applications of SWCNTs in various fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and biomedicine, and highlights the importance of understanding their optical properties for the development of novel technologies. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the absorption spectroscopy of individual SWCNTs and its implications for future research in this exciting field.
1902	We study the behaviour of the C60 molecule under very high internal or external pressure using Tersoff as well as Brenner potentials. As a result, we estimate the critical internal and external pressures that lead to its instability. We also calculate stretching force constant and bulk modulus of this molecule at several pressures under which the molecule remains stable. The values of these estimated here at zero pressure agree closely with those obtained in earlier calculations. We also observe that at high pressures, a finite value of parameter of Tersoff potential gives physically acceptable results in contrast to its value zero, which is usually taken for the carbon systems.
1452	In this contribution I will attempt to show that the study of galactic 6.7 and 12.2GHz methanol masers themselves, as opposed to the use of methanol masers as signposts, can yield important conclusions contributing to the understanding of high-mass star formation. Due to their exclusive association with star formation, methanol masers are the best tools to do this, and their large number allows to probe the entire Galaxy. In particular I will focus on the determination of the luminosity function of methanol masers and on the determination of an unambiguous signature for a circumstellar masing disc seen edge-on. Finally I will try to point out some future fields of research in the study of methanol masers.
1349	We consider higher-derivative perturbations of quantum gravity and quantum field theories in curved space and investigate tools to calculate counterterms and short-distance expansions of Feynman diagrams. In the case of single higher-derivative insertions we derive a closed formula that relates the perturbed one-loop counterterms to the unperturbed Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients. In the more general case, we classify the contributions to the short-distance expansion and outline a number of simplification methods. Certain difficulties of the common differential technique in the presence of higher-derivative perturbations are avoided by a systematic use of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, which in some cases reduces the computational effort considerably.
2060	This research paper explores the concept of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, focusing on the role of scalar gravitons in this phenomenon. The study is based on a theoretical model that proposes the existence of a scalar field that contributes to the acceleration of the Universe's expansion. The paper presents a detailed analysis of this model, including the derivation of equations and their solutions. The findings indicate that the scalar graviton field can indeed account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and the paper concludes that this model provides a promising avenue for further research in this area.
1908	In this article we show that the Holevo capacity of a classical quantum channel, can be reached not only by a POVM but by von Neumann measurement too. Furthermore we show two use of this fact 1) We can generalize the classical compound channel to quantum environment and with this new measure technique we can give an optimal coding/decoding algorithm to it. 2) We give an algorithm, with it a classical system can be decoded by quantum apparatus in linear time, which is a surprising result, because best known optimal classical decoding algorithm need n*log(n) time. This means that if a quantum machine can perform arbitrarily von Neumann measurement with only two possible outcome, then it can solve non-polynomial classical problems in linear time.
3045	This research paper investigates the two-scale structure of the electron dissipation region (EDR) during collisionless magnetic reconnection. The main objective is to understand the physical processes that occur within the EDR and their implications for magnetic reconnection. Using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, the authors find that the EDR has a distinct two-scale structure, consisting of a large-scale electron diffusion region and a small-scale electron-scale current layer. They also observe that the electron-scale current layer is much thinner than previously thought, with a thickness on the order of the electron skin depth. These findings suggest that the EDR plays a crucial role in the acceleration and heating of electrons during magnetic reconnection.
2972	We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
3044	Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
3591	The article discusses the design and development of a new three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism for use in milling machine applications. The mechanism is constructed using a combination of linear and rotational joints, which allows for greater precision and stability during milling operations. The study includes a detailed analysis of the mechanism's kinematics, dynamics, and performance characteristics, and concludes that the new mechanism is highly effective in reducing vibration and improving machining accuracy. The authors suggest that the new mechanism has potential for use in a wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the manufacturing of high-precision components.
3426	This research paper aims to present a new approach for medical image segmentation and localization using deformable templates. Medical image segmentation and localization are essential tasks in medical image analysis and diagnosis. The proposed method employs deformable templates to model the shape and appearance of anatomical structures in medical images. The templates are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different image characteristics, allowing accurate segmentation and localization of objects of interest in medical images. The method is evaluated on several medical image datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical image analysis, leading to better and more precise diagnosis and treatment planning.
3469	This research paper aims to improve the quality of noisy planar nuclear medicine images using a statistical method called mean field annealing. The study proposes a novel approach that utilizes a probabilistic model to estimate the underlying image from the noisy data. The algorithm was applied to simulated and real-world datasets, and the results were compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The findings show that mean field annealing can significantly enhance the image quality, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. The study concludes that the proposed method can be a valuable tool for improving the diagnostic accuracy of planar nuclear medicine images.
1731	The effective gluon propagator constructed with the pinch technique is governed by a Schwinger-Dyson equation with special structure and gauge properties, that can be deduced from the correspondence with the background field method. Most importantly the non-perturbative gluon self-energy is transverse order-by-order in the dressed loop expansion, and separately for gluonic and ghost contributions, a property which allows for a meanigfull truncation. A linearized version of the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equation is derived, using a vertex that satisfies the required Ward identity and contains massless poles. The resulting integral equation, subject to a properly regularized constraint, is solved numerically, and the main features of the solutions are briefly discussed.
D2-95	Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. PET is a common imaging technique, a medical scintillography technique used in nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical – a radioisotope attached to a drug – is injected into the body as a tracer. When the radiopharmaceutical undergoes beta plus decay, a positron is emitted, and when the positron interacts with an ordinary electron, the two particles annihilate and two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.
2385	This research paper investigates the sensitivity of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy is a novel technique that combines the benefits of differential stereoscopy and spectral imaging to produce high-quality images with enhanced sensitivity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique by comparing it to other existing spectral imaging methods. The experimental results show that hybrid differential stereoscopy is highly sensitive and outperforms other methods in terms of image quality and spectral resolution. Therefore, it has great potential in various applications such as biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial inspection. This research provides valuable insights into the development of hybrid differential stereoscopy for spectral imaging and its future applications.
1542	In this paper we suggest a theoretical method based on the statistical mechanics for treating the alpha-helix-random coil transition in alanine polypeptides. We consider this process as a first-order phase transition and develop a theory which is free of model parameters and is based solely on fundamental physical principles. It describes essential thermodynamical properties of the system such as heat capacity, the phase transition temperature and others from the analysis of the polypeptide potential energy surface calculated as a function of two dihedral angles, responsible for the polypeptide twisting. The suggested theory is general and with some modification can be applied for the description of phase transitions in other complex molecular systems (e.g. proteins, DNA, nanotubes, atomic clusters, fullerenes).
2524	"The research paper titled ""Elasticity with Arbitrarily Shaped Inhomogeneity"" explores the behavior of elasticity in materials that have arbitrary shapes of inhomogeneity. The main theme of the paper is to investigate how the shape, size, and orientation of the inhomogeneity affect the overall elasticity of the material. The study uses mathematical modeling and simulations to analyze the behavior of the material under various conditions. The research findings suggest that the shape and size of the inhomogeneity have a significant impact on the material's elasticity, and the orientation of the inhomogeneity can cause anisotropic behavior. The paper concludes that understanding the impact of inhomogeneity on elasticity is crucial in designing materials with desired properties and developing better models for predicting the behavior of materials."
1200	We show that the category of projective modules over a graded commutative ring admits a triangulation with respect to module suspension if and only if the ring is a finite product of graded fields and exterior algebras on one generator over a graded field (with a unit in the appropriate degree). We also classify the ungraded commutative rings for which the category of projective modules admits a triangulation with respect to the identity suspension. Applications to two analogues of the generating hypothesis in algebraic topology are given, and we translate our results into the setting of modules over a symmetric ring spectrum or S-algebra.
3054	We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the performance gains offered by random network coding.
D2-52	Mainstream physicists treat “quarks” and “gluons” as real particles. However, the observational evidence disagrees with that conclusion. Whereas electron and protons exist for billions of years, “quarks” are only observed for less than billionths of a second. Gluons are not observed at all, but are only theorized. When “quarks” are “observed,” it is during a collision among protons and/or neutrons in an accelerator. After the collision, the “quarks” completely disappear and are never observed again. There has never been an observation of a “sea of quarks” among from which could be used to construct new protons or neutrons. “Quarks” are nothing more than debris from a collision; much like glass shards are debris from a glass striking a brick wall.
8	The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks, here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.
2321	We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state, the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.
1835	We experimentally study the fluid flow induced by a broad, penetrable barrier moving through an elongated dilute gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate. The barrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the resulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. We examine both cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: At slow speeds of the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the condensate. At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which the condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton formation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the condensate is seen again.
3393	This research paper explores the ontology of temperature in nonequilibrium systems. The main objective is to investigate how temperature can be defined and understood in systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. The paper examines the role of statistical mechanics in defining temperature and discusses how this approach can be extended to nonequilibrium systems. The results show that temperature in nonequilibrium systems is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to a single measure. Instead, temperature must be understood in the context of the system's dynamics, with different measures of temperature depending on the specific properties of the system under consideration. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of nonequilibrium systems and for the broader understanding of temperature in physics.
1565	The blow-up in finite time for the solutions to the initial-boundary value problem associated to the multi-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a bounded domain is proved. The model consists on conservation of mass equation and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible Euler equations corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance. The proof is based on a-priori estimates for the energy functional for a new observable constructed with an auxiliary function, and it is shown that, under suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data, the solution blows up after a finite time.
2471	"This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional models? In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage regression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain conditions."
806	This research paper investigates the confinement properties of an ensemble of dyons. Dyons are magnetic monopoles that carry both electric and magnetic charges, and their confinement is an important topic in theoretical physics. The main theme of this paper is to study how the dyons interact with each other and how they are confined within a system. Noteworthy results include the identification of a new confinement mechanism, which was found to be related to the presence of a topological charge. Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of these findings for our understanding of confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories. Overall, the paper contributes new insights into the behavior of dyons and their confinement, which have important implications for theoretical physics.
3584	We elaborate a theory for the modeling of concepts using the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. Concepts are represented by vectors in the complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics and membership weights of items are modeled by quantum weights calculated following the quantum rules. We apply this theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that experimental data of membership weights of items with respect to the disjunction of concepts can be modeled accurately. It is the quantum effects of interference and superposition, combined with an effect of context, that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and underextension observed as deviations from a classical use of the disjunction. We put forward a graphical explanation of the effects of overextension and underextension by interpreting the quantum model applied to the modeling of the disjunction of concepts.
480	The accurate modeling of peptides is crucial for understanding biological processes and developing new drugs. In this research paper, we explore efficient model chemistries for peptides using split-valence Gaussian basis sets and the heterolevel approximation in both restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and second-order M ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). We demonstrate that the heterolevel approximation can significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining high accuracy in RHF calculations. Additionally, we show that the use of split-valence basis sets can improve the accuracy of MP2 calculations while also reducing the computational cost. Overall, our findings suggest that these model chemistries can provide efficient and accurate simulations of peptides, making them valuable tools for drug discovery and other biochemical applications.
559	This research paper focuses on the origin of the work function, which is a fundamental concept in the field of solid-state physics. The work function is the energy required to remove an electron from a solid material, and its value plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of electronic devices. The paper reviews the historical development of the concept of work function and discusses various theories that have been proposed to explain its origin. The authors argue that the work function is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors such as the electronic structure of the material, its surface characteristics, and the presence of impurities. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the origin of the work function in designing and optimizing electronic devices.
2032	The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is a well-known phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where the frequent measurements of a system can prevent it from evolving. However, recent studies have suggested the possibility of a Total Quantum Zeno Effect (TQZE), where the system remains in its initial state indefinitely, even without continuous measurements. In this paper, we explore the concept of TQZE beyond the traditional Zeno time limit and investigate the conditions under which it can occur. We demonstrate that TQZE can be achieved by manipulating the system-environment interaction and by employing different measurement strategies. Our findings have significant implications for quantum information processing and control, where TQZE can be exploited to enhance the stability and coherence of quantum systems.
1750	The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth was studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature stage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy concentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal and vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged defects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations necessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot cooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine concentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the high-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities were obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the postgrowth annealing of the ingot.
1577	This research paper explores the observation of high redshift galaxy clusters through the lensing of the Ostriker-Vishniac effect. The study aims to investigate the impact of this effect on the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in the early universe. The paper presents the results of simulations and observations using the South Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, indicating that the Ostriker-Vishniac effect could provide a powerful tool for studying the properties of high redshift galaxy clusters. The research suggests that this effect can be used to estimate the mass and velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters, providing a valuable method for studying the evolution of these structures over time. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the Ostriker-Vishniac effect in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters and its potential for future cosmological research.
3829	We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
759	Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been discovered in the X-ray emission of many neutron stars and black holes. The QPOs with frequencies greater than about 300 Hz are thought to be produced near the surfaces of neutron stars and the event horizons of black holes. I first summarize some of the most important properties of the QPOs seen in neutron star and black hole systems. I then review some of the models that have been proposed and compare them with observational data. Finally, I describe how these QPOs can be used to determine the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields.
2940	We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts. Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy, leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer.
2777	The research paper aims to investigate the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices on the surfaces of four Uranian moons - Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon - using spectroscopic observations from the Infrared Telescope Facility/Spectral Energy Distribution Camera. The study found that all four moons exhibited significant variations in the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices, with Ariel and Umbriel showing the highest concentrations of CO2 ice and Titania and Oberon having the highest concentrations of H2O ice. The researchers also noted that the distribution of H2O and CO2 ices appears to be influenced by factors such as surface temperature, albedo, and geological processes like impact cratering and tectonic activity. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the surface composition and geological history of these Uranian moons.
1151	"The research paper titled ""Dual nature of improper ferroelectricity in a magnetoelectric multiferroic"" investigates the behavior of a material called BiFeO3, which exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic properties. The main focus of the study is to understand the relationship between these two properties and how they can be manipulated for potential technological applications. The researchers found that the ferroelectric behavior in BiFeO3 is not purely intrinsic, but rather a result of a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. They also discovered that the magnetic behavior of the material can be controlled by an external electric field, opening up possibilities for new types of devices that combine magnetic and electric properties. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex behavior of multiferroic materials and their potential for technological applications."
90	"The research paper titled ""Brownian subordinators and fractional Cauchy problems"" studies the behavior of Brownian subordinators, which are stochastic processes that describe the distribution of waiting times between two events. The authors use these subordinators to solve fractional Cauchy problems, which are partial differential equations involving a fractional derivative. They show that the solution to these problems can be expressed in terms of the Laplace transform of the Brownian subordinator. The authors also provide numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of the solution in various scenarios. The key finding of the paper is that Brownian subordinators provide a useful tool for solving fractional Cauchy problems, which have important applications in physics, engineering, and finance."
2337	We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.
D2-2	Spermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood.
1292	This research paper examines the intermediate regime in the Tetrathiafulvalene-Chloranil (TTF-CA) pressure-induced neutral-ionic transition. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis, we investigate the behavior of TTF-CA under varying pressure conditions. Our findings reveal the existence of an intermediate regime where the system exhibits unique properties that differ from both the neutral and ionic states. We also identify critical pressure points that trigger the transition from the intermediate regime to the ionic state. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of TTF-CA and may have implications for the development of new materials with unique electronic and optical properties.
D2-35	"Einstein and Schrödinger exchanged significant ideas throughout their careers. Both physicists shared deep skepticism about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, maintaining a correspondence that revealed their mutual discomfort with quantum indeterminism. Einstein's famous quote, ""God does not play dice with the universe,"" echoed Schrödinger's own reservations. Their intellectual relationship flourished through letters and occasional meetings, where they discussed unified field theory and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment partially emerged from these discussions, attempting to illustrate what both considered absurdities in quantum theory. Though they never resolved their concerns about quantum mechanics, their dialogue represented one of the most profound scientific exchanges of the 20th century, challenging mainstream quantum interpretations while searching for deeper truths."
3904	A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.
2453	"The research paper ""Subfactors and Hadamard Matrices"" explores the connection between subfactors, which are mathematical objects used in the study of quantum physics, and Hadamard matrices, which are matrices used in signal processing and coding theory. In particular, the paper investigates the relationship between the index of a subfactor and the existence of certain types of Hadamard matrices. The authors provide several examples of subfactors and corresponding Hadamard matrices, and conclude that the existence of certain Hadamard matrices is intimately linked with the structure of subfactors. The paper offers new insights into the connections between different areas of mathematics and suggests potential avenues for future research."
1703	OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of remnant-cloud interaction. We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36 supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.
2736	One-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels using current Internet protocols. However, the need for renewing shared secret keys make this method unpractical. This work shows how users can use a fast physical random generator based on fluctuations of a light field and the Internet channel to directly boost key renewals. The transmitted signals are deterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the attacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is achieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring numbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed. Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are determined.
2205	The research paper discusses the concept of gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories. Gauge invariance is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the physical laws should remain the same even when the gauge is changed. The paper explores the impact of massive gauge fields on gauge invariance and the resulting gravitational interactions. The research concludes that gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field theories can be made gauge invariant by introducing a scalar field that couples to the gauge fields. This coupling allows for the existence of a mass term without breaking the gauge symmetry, leading to consistent gravitational interactions. The findings have important implications for the development of unified theories of fundamental interactions.
2351	The paper focuses on analyzing the game-theoretic power control mechanism in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless networks with rake receivers. The authors use a large system analysis approach to investigate the behavior and performance of the power control game in such networks. They propose a new algorithm for power control that takes into account the interference caused by multiple access points in the network. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network's throughput and reduce interference compared to other existing algorithms. The authors conclude that game-theoretic power control can be an effective solution for managing interference in UWB wireless networks with rake receivers.
2860	The hyperfine structure of highly-charged ions is investigated using laser spectroscopy, aiming to test the validity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in high fields. Theoretical predictions suggest deviations from QED at high fields, making this a key test for the theory. The experimental setup involves the use of a high-resolution laser to excite transitions between hyperfine states in the ions, with measurements taken to determine the energy levels and the strength of the hyperfine interaction. The results are compared with QED predictions, and any deviations from the theory are analyzed. This research provides important insights into the behavior of matter in extreme conditions and could have implications for fundamental physics and technology applications.
3955	This research paper explores the reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states. By analyzing the behavior of these values in different systems, it was discovered that their values are not always what one would expect based on classical physics. Specifically, it was found that the expectation values of linear momentum can be zero even when the particle is in motion, and the expectation values of angular momentum can be non-zero even when the system has no net angular momentum. These findings highlight the limitations of classical physics in predicting the behavior of quantum systems and have important implications for understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.
794	The research paper analyzes the deterministic factors of stock networks based on cross-correlation in financial markets. The study uses daily stock price data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to construct a network of stocks based on cross-correlation coefficients. The researchers identify key stocks or hubs that play a vital role in the network's structure and dynamics. The analysis shows that the stock network's topology is influenced by both the underlying industry structure and the market conditions, with the market volatility being a significant determinant. The study also finds that the stock network's centralization and clustering increase during market downturns, indicating a higher degree of interdependence between stocks. These findings have practical implications for portfolio diversification and risk management strategies.
460	This research paper investigates the Wigner functions, coherent states, one-dimensional marginal probabilities, and uncertainty structures of Landau levels. Using the Wigner formalism, we derive the Wigner functions for the coherent states of the Landau Hamiltonian, and subsequently obtain the corresponding one-dimensional marginal probabilities. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional marginal probabilities are dependent on the magnetic field strength, and exhibit oscillatory behavior. We also analyze the uncertainty structures of these states, and show that they obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Our results shed light on the quantum behavior of charged particles in a magnetic field, and provide a deeper understanding of Landau levels.
2421	This research paper explores the principle of virtual work and its relationship with maximum entropy. The primary theme is the application of this principle in the context of statistical mechanics. The authors derive the maximum entropy principle from the principle of virtual work and show that it can be used to explain various phenomena in physics. The findings suggest that the principle of virtual work provides a powerful tool for understanding the principles underlying statistical mechanics. The paper concludes that the principle of virtual work has significant implications for understanding the behavior of complex systems in physics and other fields.
D1-29	The COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, but that doesn’t mean the novel coronavirus had originated from China. It may have originated from somewhere else. To determine the origin of an unknown virus requires scientific, meticulous research, instead of random speculation. The source of the virus is a scientific issue and requires a professional investigation. Without evidence supported by data or research, no one can claim where it had originated from. Connecting a virus with a region may cause xenophobic behavior. The pandemic influenza of 2009 originated in North America, but it was not called the “North America flu.” That is why the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus “COVID-19,” which avoids stigmatizing a particularly region.
2477	I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.
2614	The research paper explores how the language used in physics affects student learning. The main subject of the paper is the use of conceptual metaphor and functional grammar to analyze the language used in physics textbooks and lectures. The paper emphasizes the key findings and conclusions, which suggest that the language used in physics can have a significant impact on student learning. Specifically, the use of abstract language and complex sentence structures can make it difficult for students to understand the concepts being taught. The paper recommends that physics teachers use more concrete language and simpler sentence structures to enhance student learning.
3661	This research paper discusses the crystal channeling of forward protons in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with preserved distribution in phase space. The study focuses on the use of bent crystals to deflect proton beams, while preserving their momentum and transverse distribution. The results show that crystal channeling can be used to manipulate the trajectory of protons without significantly affecting their phase space distribution. This technique has potential applications in high-energy physics experiments, as well as in medical and industrial applications. The study concludes that crystal channeling is a promising tool for manipulating charged particle beams and that further research is needed to optimize the process for practical applications.
1858	This research paper focuses on developing an efficient method for calculating the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) for iterative decoding on fading channels. It proposes a new algorithm that optimizes the performance of the LLR calculation by considering the channel characteristics and minimizing the computational complexity. The proposed method is compared with existing techniques, and the results show that it provides significantly better performance while reducing the computational complexity. The significant outcome of this research is that the proposed optimum linear LLR calculation method can achieve better decoding performance in fading channels with reduced computational complexity, making it suitable for practical applications that require high data rates and low latency.
86	This research paper presents a study of the electrical conductivity of quantum electrodynamics (QED) using the 2PI effective action. The primary theme of the paper is to investigate the impact of the effective action on the electrical conductivity of QED. The paper shows that the 2PI effective action method provides a more accurate description of the electrical conductivity in QED than other traditional approaches. The significant findings of the study include the calculation of the electric conductivity for a wide range of temperatures and densities and the observation of a novel plasma mode. The research concludes that the 2PI effective action is a powerful tool for exploring the electrical conductivity of QED and can provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly interacting systems.
2791	We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts. First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then, the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to previous studies.
2439	This research paper explores the phenomenon of spherically symmetrical accretion in fractal media, which has been poorly understood until now. The primary theme of the research revolves around the mathematical analysis of accretion in fractal media and its implications for the evolution of astrophysical objects. The study finds that the fractal dimension of the medium plays a vital role in determining the accretion rate and the final mass of the accreting body. The research also provides insights into the dynamics of accretion disks and the formation of jets in fractal media. Overall, the study highlights the importance of fractal geometry in understanding accretion processes and suggests new avenues for future research.
2567	This research paper discusses the interpretation of muon-spin-rotation experiments in the mixed state of type-II superconductors. The central focus is on the use of muon-spin-rotation as a tool to investigate the properties of the mixed state, and the challenges associated with interpreting the experimental results. The paper presents a theoretical model for interpreting the data and demonstrates its applicability to experimental results. The important outcomes of the study include a better understanding of the properties of the mixed state, and the development of a theoretical framework for interpreting muon-spin-rotation experiments. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research in this area.
1786	In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm) showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation, whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.
779	We define a new family of random spin models with one-dimensional structure, finite-range multi-spin interactions, and bounded average degree (number of interactions in which each spin participates). Unfrustrated ground states can be described as solutions of a sparse, band diagonal linear system, thus allowing for efficient numerical analysis. In the limit of infinite interaction range, we recover the so-called XORSAT (diluted p-spin) model, that is known to undergo a random first order phase transition as the average degree is increased. Here we investigate the most important consequences of a large but finite interaction range: (i) Fluctuation-induced corrections to thermodynamic quantities; (ii) The need of an inhomogeneous (position dependent) order parameter; (iii) The emergence of a finite mosaic length scale. In particular, we study the correlation length divergence at the (mean-field) glass transition.
1877	This research paper provides an overview of conservation laws, their relation to the generation of physical fields, and the principles of field theories. The paper examines the significance of conservation laws in understanding the behavior of physical systems and the role they play in the generation of fields. The paper also discusses the principles of field theories, including the concept of symmetry, gauge invariance, and the quantization of fields. Through a comprehensive analysis of these concepts, the paper suggests that a deep understanding of conservation laws and field theories is essential for understanding the fundamental nature of physical phenomena. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of conservation laws and field theories in the development of modern physics and their potential application in future research and technology.
2212	We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.
2052	This research paper investigates the feasibility of using donor type semiconductors as maser active medium at low temperatures. The study involved the fabrication of a maser device using a specially designed donor type semiconductor material. The device was then subjected to various tests to determine its performance as a maser active medium. The results showed that the donor type semiconductor material was able to produce coherent microwave radiation, making it a promising candidate for maser applications. The paper concludes that further research is needed to optimize the fabrication process and improve the performance of the donor type semiconductor maser device. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of using donor type semiconductors as maser active media at low temperatures.
987	The paper focuses on modelling the energy dependencies of high-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in Black Hole X-ray Binaries. The study uses data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to analyze the energy dependence of QPOs in six different sources. The authors develop a model based on a combination of thermal Comptonization and propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations to explain the energy dependence of the observed QPOs. The study finds that the model successfully explains the observations for all six sources and provides insight into the physical mechanisms behind the observed QPOs. The authors conclude that the QPOs are likely caused by the interaction between the accretion flow and the black hole's strong gravity.
1383	One way to understand the nonthermal history of the universe is by establishing the origins of the unresolved and truly diffuse extragalactic gamma rays. Dim blazars and radio/gamma galaxies certainly make an important contribution to the galactic gamma-ray background given the EGRET discoveries, and previous treatments are reviewed and compared with a new analysis. Studies of the gamma-ray intensity from cosmic rays in star-forming galaxies and from structure formation shocks, as well as from dim GRBs, are briefly reviewed. A new hard gamma-ray source class seems required from the predicted aggregate intensity compared with the measured intensity.
1166	The expansion rate of `Intermediate inflation' lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution. Present study of `Intermediate inflation' reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution, leading to late time acceleration. The corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some non-canonical form of kinetic term. Thus the so called Intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic de-Sitter expansion.
238	This research paper explores the use of transit timing observations to search for Trojans, a type of small celestial body that share a planet's orbit. The study focuses on transiting extrasolar planets, and the researchers analyze data from the Kepler spacecraft to identify potential Trojan candidates. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of Trojans, as they can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The results indicate several promising candidates for further study, and the authors conclude that transit timing observations offer a valuable tool for detecting Trojans and expanding our understanding of planetary systems.
1344	"The article titled ""Extrinsic Size Effect in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy of Thin Films"" discusses the influence of sample size on the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement of thin films. PFM is a technique used to measure the electromechanical response of materials at the nanoscale level. The study examines the extrinsic size effect, which occurs when the size of the sample affects the measured PFM signals. The authors found that the extrinsic size effect is significant in thin films with thicknesses below 100 nm and that it can be attributed to the interaction between the sample and the PFM tip. The study provides insights into the limitations of PFM measurements and the importance of carefully choosing the sample size for accurate results."
4021	A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are discussed.
3263	This research paper explores the actions of braid groups and their application in providing new algebraic proofs of results of Dehornoy and Larue.

In particular, we show how these actions can be leveraged to provide alternative proofs of results established by Dehornoy and Larue, which have important implications in a range of fields. Our findings have the potential to deepen our understanding of braid groups and their applications, and we anticipate that they will be of interest to researchers in algebraic topology and related fields.

2980	We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss further checks that need to be performed.
3253	Longitudinal studies could be complicated by left-censored repeated measures. For example, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, there is a detection limit of the assay used to quantify the plasma viral load. Simple imputation of the limit of the detection or of half of this limit for left-censored measures biases estimations and their standard errors. In this paper, we review two likelihood-based methods proposed to handle left-censoring of the outcome in linear mixed model. We show how to fit these models using SAS Proc NLMIXED and we compare this tool with other programs. Indications and limitations of the programs are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown.
1836	This research paper explores the behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate as it flows through a penetrable barrier. Both stationary and non-stationary fluid flow are analyzed, with a focus on the effects of the barrier on the fluid dynamics. The results show that the presence of the barrier can significantly alter the flow pattern, with non-stationary flow leading to the formation of vortices. Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of these findings for the study of superfluids and offers potential avenues for future research.

The main focus of the study is to understand the scattering properties of red blood cells and to develop a theoretical model that accurately predicts the scattering behavior. The study found that the discrete dipole approximation model was able to accurately predict the scattering properties of red blood cells and that the scattering behavior was highly dependent on the size, shape, and refractive index of the cells. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of new diagnostic tools for blood disorders and for the understanding of the underlying physics of light scattering in biological systems.

The noteworthy outcome of the study is the finding that the soliton solution can provide a new perspective on the behavior of the quantum particle. The research concludes by suggesting further exploration of this approach to gain a deeper understanding of the quantum world.

It enables researchers to study how genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways interact in a holistic manner, rather than in isolation. This approach is essential for deciphering the dynamics of biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic systems. The importance of computational systems biology lies in its ability to predict biological behaviors, identify potential drug targets, and develop personalized medicine strategies. It also helps in understanding diseases at a systems level, enabling the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.

Overall, the findings suggest that narrow-line cooling and trapping has great potential for advancing the field of atomic physics and quantum technologies.
951	"Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated. In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition. The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification."
2376	Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin effects.
2388	A combination of the memory function formalism and time-dependent density-functional theory is applied to transport in dilute magnetic semiconductors. The approach considers spin and charge disorder and electron-electron interaction on an equal footing. Within the weak disorder limit and using a simple parabolic approximation for the valence band we show that Coulomb and exchange scattering contributions to the resistivity in GaMnAs are of the same order of magnitude. The positional correlations of defects result in a significant increase of Coulomb scattering, while the suppression of localized spin fluctuations in the ferromagnetic phase contributes substantially to the experimentally observed drop of resistivity below T_c. A proper treatment of dynamical screening and collective excitations is essential for an accurate description of infrared absorption.
1745	The PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) study is a large-scale MRI experiment designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac MRI for the evaluation of patients with chest pain. However, the spiral MRI acquisition used in PROMISE is susceptible to boundary effects, which can compromise image quality and accuracy. In this research paper, we propose a novel method for reducing boundary effects in spiral MRI using an adaptive data-driven approach. Our results demonstrate that this method significantly improves image quality and reduces the impact of boundary effects on diagnostic accuracy in the PROMISE study. This approach has the potential to enhance the reliability and clinical value of spiral MRI in the evaluation of patients with chest pain.
1860	This research paper explores the existence and stability of solutions to Fokker-Planck equations with log-concave reference measures. The main theme is to investigate the behavior of the solutions under certain conditions. The paper presents important results such as the existence of weak solutions and the stability of the solutions in the long-time limit. The conclusion of the study is that the log-concavity of the reference measure plays a significant role in the existence and stability of the solutions, and the results obtained provide a useful framework for studying other related problems in mathematical physics and probability theory.
2089	This research paper investigates the resummed cross section for jet production at hadron colliders. The study aims to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions for jet production in high energy particle collisions. The research utilizes advanced calculations to resum the logarithmic contributions to the cross section, resulting in a more precise estimation of the jet production rates. The critical outcomes of this study include a reduction in theoretical uncertainties and an improved understanding of the underlying physics of jet production. The research suggests that the resummed cross section calculation can be used as a reliable tool for future experimental analyses. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex processes of jet production and paves the way for further advancements in high energy physics research.
2676	We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion. The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of approximating this functional significantly.
2721	This research paper explores the capillary ordering and layering transitions in two-dimensional hard-rod fluids. Using computer simulations, the authors investigate the effects of rod length, density, and aspect ratio on the formation of layers and ordering in the fluid. The primary theme of the paper is to understand the mechanisms driving these transitions and their dependence on system parameters. The study reveals that the capillary ordering and layering transitions are strongly influenced by the rod length and density, and that aspect ratio plays a significant role in determining the nature of the transitions. The paper concludes that the findings provide insights into the behavior of hard-rod fluids, which have important applications in fields such as materials science and nanotechnology.
2900	This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy element production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439. However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance. In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element observations.
1729	The Casimir effect is a well-known phenomenon in quantum field theory that arises due to the presence of boundary conditions in the vacuum energy of a system. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the Casimir effect on nontrivial topology spaces, particularly in the context of Krein space quantization. In this research paper, we investigate the Casimir effect on a nontrivial topology space, namely the torus, in the framework of Krein space quantization. We derive the Casimir energy density and investigate its dependence on the geometry and topology of the torus. Our results show that the Casimir energy density exhibits nontrivial behavior as a function of the torus parameters, indicating the potential for using the Casimir effect as a tool to probe the topology of nontrivial spaces in Krein space quantization.
3371	We consider a diffusion model with limit cycle reaction functions, in the presence of convection. We select a set of functions derived from a realistic reaction model: the Schnakenberg equations. This resultant form is unsymmetrical. We find a transformation which maps the irregular equations into model form. Next we transform the dependent variables into polar form. From here, a travelling wave analysis is performed on the radial variable. Results are complex, but we make some simple estimates. We carry out numerical experiments to test our analysis. An initial `knock' starts the propagation of pattern. The speed of the travelling wave is not quite as expected. We investigate further. The system demonstrates distinctly different behaviour to the left and the right. We explain how this phenomenon occurs by examining the underlying behaviour.
1636	We observe large-amplitude Rabi oscillations between an atomic and a molecular state near a Feshbach resonance. The experiment uses 87Rb in an optical lattice and a Feshbach resonance near 414 G. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations depend on magnetic field in a way that is well described by a two-level model. The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.
1347	Recent studies of dense clumps/cores in a number of regions of low-mass star formation have shown that the mass distribution of these clumps closely resembles the initial mass function (IMF) of field stars. One possible interpretation of these observations is that we are witnessing the fragmentation of the clouds into the IMF, and the observed clumps are bound pre-stellar cores. In this paper, we highlight a potential difficulty in this interpretation, namely that clumps of varying mass are likely to have systematically varying lifetimes. This timescale problem can effectively destroy the similarity bewteen the clump and stellar mass functions, such that a stellar-like clump mass function (CMF) results in a much steeper stellar IMF. We also discuss some ways in which this problem may be avoided.
1304	This research paper investigates the self-compensation of conduction in Cd0.95Zn0.05Te:Cl crystals under different Cd vapor pressures. The study aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the self-compensation process and its impact on the electrical properties of the crystals. The experiments were conducted using a wide range of Cd vapor pressures, and the results showed that the self-compensation effect increased with increasing Cd vapor pressure. The study also found that the self-compensation process was influenced by various factors, such as the concentration of Cl dopants and the temperature of the crystals. Overall, this research provides insights into the self-compensation mechanism in Cd0.95Zn0.05Te:Cl crystals and its potential applications in the development of novel semiconductor materials.
712	This research paper investigates the electronic emission properties of bi-layer novel organic semiconductor systems. The study analyzes the effect of the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer on the electronic properties of the bi-layer system. The results show that the electronic emission properties of the bi-layer system depend strongly on the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer. The study also finds that the bi-layer system exhibits improved electronic properties compared to the individual organic semiconductor layers. These findings suggest that bi-layer novel organic semiconductor systems have potential applications in electronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
300	We investigate the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a circular waveguide with conducting walls filled by homogeneous dielectric. The parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both TE and TM waves. It is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the TE waves. Various limiting cases are considered. The results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium.
D2-88	Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s Hydrogéologie (1802) proposed a holistic, steady-state geological model emphasizing uniformitarianism—the idea that gradual processes shape Earth’s surface over immense time. He theorized that continents erode eastward, with debris deposited westward via global currents, causing a slow continental migration. Lamarck integrated living organisms into Earth’s dynamics, arguing their metabolic activity drives the decomposition and recycling of materials, sustaining planetary equilibrium. This vision positioned biology as central to geology, pioneering ecological thinking by linking abiotic and biotic processes. However, his speculative approach—rooted in outdated four-element chemistry—drew criticism from contemporaries like Georges Cuvier and Antoine Lavoisier. Despite its flaws, Hydrogéologie laid groundwork for synthesizing Earth sciences, envisioning a unified “Physique terrestre” (terrestrial physics) combining meteorology, hydrogeology, and biology
3336	The Positive Mass Theorem is a fundamental result in general relativity that relates the mass of an asymptotically flat spacetime to its geometry. In this research paper, we focus on the near-equality case of the theorem, where the mass is almost zero but not quite. We establish new criteria for the near-equality case and show that they are satisfied in certain important examples, such as the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our findings suggest that the near-equality case is not a pathological regime of the theorem and should be taken seriously as a physical situation. We conclude that the Positive Mass Theorem remains a powerful tool for understanding the geometry and physics of spacetimes in general relativity.
690	This research paper presents a thorough characterisation of a three-dimensional Brownian motor in optical lattices. The Brownian motor is a microscopic system that converts thermal fluctuations into directed motion, making it a promising candidate for nanoscale engineering and transportation applications. The optical lattices provide a periodic potential landscape that serves as a trap for the Brownian motor, allowing it to move in a controlled manner. The characterisation of the Brownian motor is performed using a combination of theoretical modelling and experimental measurements, including the evaluation of the motor's efficiency and the analysis of its dynamics. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of Brownian motors in complex environments, which can be used to improve their design and optimise their performance for various applications.
575	This paper presents an analytical approach to investigate the thermal Casimir force between a metal and a dielectric. The calculations are based on the Lifshitz theory and the Drude model, which includes the effects of temperature and frequency. The main findings reveal that the thermal Casimir force is strongly influenced by the material properties and the separation distance between the metal and dielectric. The force increases with increasing temperature and frequency, and it also depends on the geometry of the system. These results provide a better understanding of the thermal Casimir force and its potential applications in nanotechnology and material science.
99	At the air/water interface, 4,-8-alkyl[1,1,-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (8CB) domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same Langmuir film, as multiple bilayers on a monolayer. The edge dislocation at the domain boundary leads to line tension, which determines the domain shape and dynamics. By observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions, we find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference between the coexisting phases in the film. Comparisons with theoretical treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary locates near the center of the film, which means that the 8CB multilayers are almost symmetric with respect to the air/water interface.
2075	This research paper explores the relationship between the Poincare Group in physics and the philosophy of Nagarjuna, a Buddhist philosopher. The Poincare Group is a mathematical framework used to describe the physical laws governing the universe. Nagarjuna's philosophy focuses on the concept of emptiness and the non-dual nature of reality. The paper argues that the Poincare Group and Nagarjuna's philosophy share common ground in their approach to physical reality. Both acknowledge the limitations of our understanding of reality and the need for a holistic perspective. The paper concludes that a deeper understanding of the relationship between physics and philosophy can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality.
3496	"We study the dynamics of initial nucleation processes of photoinduced structural change of molecular crystals. In order to describe the nonadiabatic transition in each molecule, we employ a model of localized electrons coupled with a fully quantized phonon mode, and the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for the model is numerically solved. We found a minimal model to describe the nucleation induced by injection of an excited state of a single molecule in which multiple types of intermolecular interactions are required. In this model coherently driven molecular distortion plays an important role in the successive conversion of electronic states which leads to photoinduced cooperative phenomena."
2788	This research paper investigates the pseudogap and charge density waves in two-dimensional systems. The main objective of this study is to understand the properties of these phenomena in various materials and their effects on electronic behavior. The paper discusses the key findings of the research, including the discovery of the interplay between pseudogap and charge density waves, the identification of the symmetry breaking of the charge density waves, and the observation of the temperature and doping dependence of the pseudogap. The paper concludes that the understanding of these phenomena is crucial for understanding the behavior of materials at low temperatures and can have important implications for the development of new technologies.
2739	This research paper proposes a new approach for measuring wave velocities in heterogeneous materials that considers the local properties of the medium. The proposed method involves measuring the wave velocity at multiple locations and then calculating a local average velocity. The results show that this approach provides a more accurate measurement of wave velocities compared to traditional methods that assume a homogeneous medium. This new approach can be useful in various fields such as seismology, geophysics, and materials science. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering local variations in wave velocities for a better understanding of the properties of heterogeneous materials.
1011	"The article titled ""The effect of dipole-dipole interactions between atoms in an active medium"" explores the impact of dipole-dipole interactions between atoms in an active medium on the behavior of the system. The authors use a theoretical approach to investigate the role of these interactions on the collective behavior of the atoms. They find that these interactions can significantly affect the dynamics of the system, leading to phenomena such as superradiance and subradiance. The authors conclude that an understanding of these interactions is important for predicting the behavior of systems and designing new technologies based on active media."
D2-6	The active quest for extra-solar planets has opened a new chapter in the book of the search for extra-terrestrial life. This was already an active field of science with the exploration of the Solar System by means of space probes, which gave rise to a ‘space age’ from 1957 when Sputnik-1, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, was launched. Current technology allows us to land a robotic chemistry laboratory on other Solar System bodies, or return samples to Earth, the latter coming with the advantage of being able to adapt analysis strategies to unexpected findings. Based on our current understanding, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, if we consider life based on a liquid other than water, Titan are the most promising places.
2665	This research paper explores the distribution of the biggest fragment (BF) in order to gain insights into the physics of fragmentation processes. The study utilizes experimental data and theoretical models to investigate the behavior of the BF in different collision systems and impact energies. The analysis reveals that the distribution of the BF exhibits scaling behavior that is consistent with a self-similarity hypothesis. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the fragmentation process and can inform the development of new models for predicting fragment distributions in a variety of contexts. The research also highlights the importance of careful experimental design and data analysis in studying complex physical phenomena. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the value of studying the distribution of the BF in advancing our understanding of fragmentation and related phenomena.
1690	The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and discussed from several different perspectives: (i) stability of motion against external perturbations and decoherence, (ii) efficiency of quantum simulation in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator spaces, (iii) quantum transport, relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing, and (iv) computation of quantum dynamical entropies. Discussions of all these criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or quantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some conjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many problem are suggested.
3379	This research paper investigates the diversity of rise times in Type Ia supernovae and whether they can be separated into two distinct modes. The study uses a sample of 118 supernovae and applies a decline-rate correction to the rise times. The results suggest that there may be two distinct modes of rise times, with one mode having a faster rise time and the other having a slower rise time. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the physical mechanisms behind this diversity. The implications of these findings for the use of Type Ia supernovae as cosmological distance indicators are also discussed.
3800	"This paper explores the concept of monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups, which are known for their unusual and intricate properties. We begin by reviewing the basic theory of Thompson groups and their associated monoid structures. We then introduce a new class of monoids, which we call ""Thompson-like monoids"", that generalize the Richard Thompson groups and exhibit similar algebraic and geometric properties. We investigate the relationship between these monoids and their associated groups, and provide examples of new monoids that arise from this construction. Finally, we discuss potential applications of these monoid generalizations in group theory and topology. Overall, this paper provides a new perspective on the Richard Thompson groups and demonstrates the richness of their underlying algebraic structures."
329	It is widely acknowledged that good object clustering is critical to the performance of object-oriented databases. However, object clustering always involves some kind of overhead for the system. The aim of this paper is to propose a modelling methodology in order to evaluate the performances of different clustering policies. This methodology has been used to compare the performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering overhead.
D2-17	Quarks and gluons are both fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, but they have distinct roles. Quarks are the building blocks of matter, combining to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. They come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks have fractional electric charges and interact via the strong nuclear force, which holds them together inside protons and neutrons. Gluons, on the other hand, are force carrier particles responsible for transmitting the strong nuclear force between quarks. Unlike quarks, gluons have no mass and no electric charge, but they do carry a property called color charge, which allows them to bind quarks together through a phenomenon known as color confinement.
3033	This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
1176	We construct analytic solutions for marginal deformations satisfying the reality condition in open superstring field theory formulated by Berkovits when operator products made of the marginal operator and the associated superconformal primary field are regular. Our strategy is based on the recent observation by Erler that the problem of finding solutions for marginal deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality condition by construction.
3639	Under the hypotheses of smoothness in the coupling constant, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, the consistent interactions between a single free massless tensor gauge field with the mixed symmetry of a two-column Young diagram of the type (3,1) and one Abelian vector field have been investigated. The computations are done with the help of the deformation theory based on a cohomological approach, in the context of the antifield-BRST formalism. The main result is that there exist nontrivial cross-couplings between these types of fields in five spatiotemporal dimensions, which break the PT invariance and allow for the deformation of the gauge transformations of the vector field, but not of the gauge algebra.
2897	This research paper investigates the possibility of d-wave superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors through electron-phonon interactions. The primary theme focuses on understanding the mechanism behind the unconventional pairing symmetry in these superconductors. The study uses theoretical calculations and analysis to explore how the electron-phonon interaction can lead to d-wave superconductivity. The significant findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling can play a crucial role in the emergence of d-wave superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. The paper concludes that a better understanding of these interactions can lead to the development of new materials and technologies in the field of superconductivity.
1933	This research paper investigates the feasibility of using mechanical unzipping data to infer DNA sequences in the large-bandwidth case. We propose a novel method that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and physical models to reconstruct DNA sequences from the mechanical unzipping data. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the mechanical unzipping force distribution contains information about the underlying DNA sequence. We validate our method using simulated data and demonstrate its effectiveness on experimental data obtained from a high-bandwidth mechanical unzipping setup. Our results suggest that mechanical unzipping can be a promising approach for fast and accurate DNA sequencing, especially in high-bandwidth scenarios.
3136	This paper presents high-resolution observations of molecular gas in the vicinity of the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The study reveals significant jet-induced disturbances in the molecular gas, including a bent arm and a bright knot, which are likely caused by the interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium. The researchers also find evidence of inflowing gas towards the central region of the galaxy, which suggests that the jet may be triggering or fueling the nuclear activity. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between jets, molecular gas, and nuclear activity in galaxies.
1356	This research paper proposes a new approach to designing large-scale Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems using nature-inspired interconnects. The proposed approach is based on the self-assembly process of biological systems, such as the nervous system in animals and the vascular system in plants. The authors demonstrate that this approach can lead to more efficient and scalable NoC designs compared to traditional interconnect designs. The paper presents a case study of a self-assembled NoC design based on the vascular system of plants, which shows promising results in terms of performance and power consumption. The authors conclude that nature-inspired interconnects have the potential to revolutionize the design of large-scale NoC systems and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable computing systems.
129	"It is shown that the the interference of above-threshold electron de Broglie waves, generated by an intense laser pulse at a metal surface yields attosecond electron pulses. This inerference is an analogon of the superposition of high harmonics generated from rare gas atoms, resulting in trains of attosecond light pulses.Owing to the inherent kinematic dispersion, the propagation of attosecond de Broglie waves in vacuum is very different from that of attosecond light pulses, which propagate without changing shape. Above the metal surface there are ""collaps bands"" and ""revival layers"" of the electron current even at macroscopic distances. In the range of parameters considered, the maximum value of the current densities of such ultrashort electron pulses has been estimated to be of order of couple of tenths of milliamps per square centimeters."
1796	This research paper investigates the mixing-demixing transition and collapse of a vortex state in a quasi-two-dimensional boson-fermion mixture. By utilizing numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the addition of fermions to the mixture can significantly impact the vortex dynamics and lead to a collapse of the vortex state. More specifically, we find that the collapse occurs due to the reduction of the effective bosonic interactions caused by the presence of fermions. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between bosonic and fermionic components in such mixtures and provide insight into the behavior of vortex states in these systems.
714	This research paper investigates the impact of external fields, hydrostatic pressure, and impurities on a rectangular potential barrier. The study employs theoretical analysis and simulations to assess the changes in the barrier's characteristics under varying conditions. The outcomes indicate that the barrier's height and width are significantly affected by the external fields and hydrostatic pressure, while impurities have a negligible impact. The study also highlights the potential use of these findings in developing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the fundamental physics of potential barriers and provides insights into their practical applications.

3640	"The research paper titled ""Couplings between a single massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry (3,1) and one vector field"" explores the interaction between a massless tensor field and a vector field. The paper focuses on a specific type of tensor field with mixed symmetry (3,1), and investigates the couplings between this field and a vector field in the context of general relativity. The authors derive the equations of motion for both fields and analyze the resulting dynamics. They find that the tensor field has both propagating and non-propagating modes, and that the vector field can interact with both types of modes. The paper concludes that this coupling between the tensor and vector fields has important implications for gravitational waves and the overall behavior of the universe."
3201	A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter, for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences. Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.
1334	The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.
626	Hard processes leading to high transverse momentum hadron production are calculable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for proton-proton collisions. In heavy-ion collisions, such processes occur as well, and due to a separation of scales are calculable on the level of the production of high p_T partons. These subsequently interact with the medium which originates from semi-hard and soft processes in the same collision before they hadronize. The presence of the medium thus modifies the momentum spectrum of outgoing partons and thus hard hadrons. The idea of jet tomography is to study this modification in order to learn about the medium density distribution. While this is a compelling idea, its practical application encounters some difficulties. In this paper, the capability of various observables to provide tomographic information about the medium is discussed and compared.
2213	This research paper presents simulations of the aging and plastic deformation of polymer glasses. The simulations show that polymer glasses undergo structural rearrangements during aging, leading to an increase in mechanical properties. Plastic deformation is also observed to occur via the formation of shear bands. The simulations suggest that the mechanical behavior of polymer glasses is strongly influenced by the aging process and the resulting structural changes. Noteworthy findings include the observation of a transition from brittle to ductile behavior with increasing aging time and the dependence of plastic deformation on the strain rate. Overall, the simulations provide insights into the complex mechanical behavior of polymer glasses and can help guide the design of more durable and reliable materials.
1571	This research paper investigates the local impurity effects in superconducting graphene. Specifically, we explore how the presence of impurities in the graphene lattice influences the superconducting properties of the material. Our findings suggest that the local impurity effects can significantly affect the superconducting behavior of graphene, altering its critical temperature and coherence length. Furthermore, we observe that the nature and location of the impurities play a crucial role in determining the extent of their impact on superconductivity. Our study adds to the growing body of research on the behavior of superconducting graphene and provides insights into the design and development of graphene-based superconductors.
3299	The recent detection of the hydrocarbon anion C6H- in the interstellar medium has led us to investigate the synthesis of hydrocarbon anions in a variety of interstellar and circumstellar environments. We find that the anion/neutral abundance ratio can be quite large, on the order of at least a few percent, once the neutral has more than five carbon atoms. Detailed modeling shows that the column densities of C6H- observed in IRC+10216 and TMC-1 can be reproduced. Our calculations also predict that other hydrocarbon anions, such as C4H- and C8H-, are viable candidates for detection in IRC+10216, TMC-1 and photon-dominated regions such as the Horsehead Nebula.
1065	We calculate the radiative properties for a linear dipole-coupled chain of qubits. Using the explicit energy eigenstates of the system, we find the radiation patterns for spontaneous transitions from the one-photon eigenstates to the ground state of the system. We show that depending on the excitation of a specific atom, the radiation tends to be focused either along or perpendicular to the chain. We conclude with a derivation of the total decay rate of the one-photon eigenstates, and find the interesting result that for systems where the photon wavenumber is not much larger than the interatomic spacing, up to 94% of the eigenstates are subradiant, that is, they decay significantly slower than a single atom in isolation.
D2-76	Phthalates or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably. Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers. Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most  known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
633	This research paper investigates the screening masses in the SU(3) pure gauge theory and explores their potential relationship with universality. The study utilizes lattice simulations to calculate the screening masses, which are a fundamental property of the theory that describes the behavior of quark-antiquark pairs at large distances. The results demonstrate that the screening masses exhibit a universal scaling behavior, indicating a possible connection to universality. Additionally, the study examines the impact of different lattice sizes and couplings on the screening masses, providing insights into the theory's behavior under various conditions. The findings shed light on the fundamental properties of the SU(3) pure gauge theory and may have implications for our understanding of universality in gauge theories.
3917	This research paper investigates the impact of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four-dimensional Universe. The study employs theoretical models and computational simulations to explore the behavior of energy conservation in different scenarios where a fifth dimension is present, absent, or varying in size. The results indicate that the existence of a fifth dimension may significantly affect the conservation of energy, depending on its properties and interactions with the four-dimensional space-time. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and their implications for the structure and dynamics of the Universe.
1907	The research paper explores the behavior of cosmological singularities in spatially-homogeneous models with a cosmological constant. The study focuses on isotropic singularities, which are characterized by the collapse of the universe to a point of infinite density. The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the conditions that lead to isotropic singularities in these models and investigates the effect of a cosmological constant on the singularity behavior. The crucial results of the study suggest that the presence of a cosmological constant can delay or prevent the onset of isotropic singularities, leading to a more stable and predictable universe. The paper concludes that further research is needed to fully understand the role of the cosmological constant in the behavior of cosmological singularities.
1037	This research paper focuses on mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent in diffusive Josephson junctions. The study employs a numerical approach to investigate the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the critical current of the junction. The main findings reveal that the critical current is strongly affected by thermal and quantum fluctuations, leading to a broadening of the current distribution. The study also shows that the distribution of the supercurrent is not necessarily Gaussian, and the width of the distribution increases with increasing temperature and decreasing junction length. These results provide important insights into the behavior of supercurrent in diffusive Josephson junctions and have implications for the design and optimization of such devices for practical applications.
3862	We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions.
D2-34	The main causes of lung cancer are primarily linked to smoking and environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause, responsible for about 85% of cases, as the harmful chemicals in smoke damage DNA in lung cells. Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor. Another major cause is exposure to radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive substance that can accumulate in buildings. Occupational exposures to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust also increase the risk, particularly in certain industries. Additionally, genetic factors and family history can make some individuals more susceptible, while air pollution and poor air quality further contribute to the development of lung cancer.
1625	This research paper investigates the interaction between a high-intensity photon beam and a plasma, with a focus on its possible role in gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission mechanisms. The study uses a relativistic approach to model the interaction and examines the resulting dynamics and radiation emission. The research finds that the photon beam can generate a strong electric field in the plasma, leading to the acceleration of electrons and the production of high-energy photons. These processes can potentially explain some of the observed properties of GRBs, such as their high energy and short duration. The study highlights the importance of considering plasma effects in understanding the physics of GRBs.
3038	This research paper proposes an opportunistic relay selection scheme with limited feedback in a cooperative communication system. The main objective is to improve the system's performance by selecting the most suitable relay node to forward the information. The proposed scheme utilizes a feedback mechanism that reduces the amount of feedback required from the source node, thus conserving resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant performance gains compared to conventional schemes, particularly in scenarios with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. The study concludes that the proposed scheme is an effective solution for improving the performance of cooperative communication systems with limited feedback.
3861	The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune that harbors small, icy bodies, known as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). In this research paper, we investigate the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Our study shows that KBOs formed through the agglomeration of small particles and grew through mutual collisions. We find that the collisional evolution is highly dependent on the initial size distribution and the strength of the KBOs. Our simulations also suggest that the observed size distribution of KBOs can be explained by the collisional grinding of larger bodies. Our results shed light on the early history of the outer solar system and have implications for the formation of the planets.
1388	This research paper examines the evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, specifically in relation to biodiversity cycles. The concept of biodiversity cycles suggests that there are regular, predictable patterns in the rise and fall of species diversity over time, and that these patterns may be linked to astronomical and/or geological cycles. This paper reexamines the evidence for biodiversity cycles, drawing on recent developments in paleontological and statistical methods. The results suggest that while there is some evidence for periodicity in the fossil record, the case for biodiversity cycles is far from conclusive. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this area, and by identifying some of the key challenges and opportunities for future work.
793	The stock market has been known to form homogeneous stock groups with a higher correlation among different stocks according to common economic factors that influence individual stocks. We investigate the role of common economic factors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic factors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors.
2620	"The research paper ""Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic Center"" presents a novel method to identify dark matter burners, which are hypothetical objects that could be responsible for the excess gamma-ray emission observed from the galactic center. Using a combination of simulations and observational data, the authors propose that dark matter burners could be rapidly spinning neutron stars that accrete dark matter and emit gamma rays as a result. They identify several candidate sources in the galactic center that could be dark matter burners and suggest further observations to confirm their hypothesis. The study provides a new avenue for exploring the nature of dark matter and its interactions with other particles."
2732	Two kinds of simulated bilayers are described and the results are reported for lateral tension and for partial contributions of intermolecular forces to it.Data for a widest possible range of areas per surfactant head, from tunnel formation through tensionless state, transition to floppy bilayer,to its disintegration, are reported and discussed. The significance of the tensionless state, is discussed. Conclusions: (1) the tensionless state is a coincidence;(2) the transition from extended to floppy bilayer occurs nearby and has hallmarks of a phase transition (3) there is no theory of that transition.(4)The lateral tension of the floppy bilayer scales with size; that of the extended bilayer does not depend on size. (4) The drumhead model not appropriate for interfaces as these fluctuate via diffusion.(5) The radius of gyration also! shows a discontinuity.
D1-12	Biological evolution, according to Charles Darwin, refers to the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down from one generation to the next. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that individuals within a species show variation in their characteristics. These variations can affect their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Those individuals with traits that give them a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring, while less advantageous traits are gradually eliminated. Over long periods, this process leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in the population, resulting in the adaptation of species to their environment.
577	This research paper presents an inequality for the Perron and Floquet eigenvalues of monotone differential systems and age-structured equations. The main objective of the paper is to derive a new inequality that relates the Perron and Floquet eigenvalues of these systems. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of this inequality in the analysis of population models and delay differential equations. The paper provides a rigorous proof of the inequality and shows that it is sharp. The authors also present several numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the inequality. The key conclusion of the paper is that the new inequality is a powerful tool for the analysis of monotone differential systems and age-structured equations, and can lead to new insights into the behavior of these systems.
342	This research paper examines the phenomenon of multiple random walks being faster than a single random walk. Using mathematical models and simulations, we demonstrate that in certain scenarios, multiple walkers can reach their target faster than a single walker. Our findings suggest that this phenomenon is applicable in various fields, including biology, physics, and computer science. We also discuss the implications of our research for optimizing search algorithms and improving efficiency in various real-world applications. Overall, our study sheds light on the importance of considering the role of multiple actors in complex systems and highlights the potential benefits of collaboration and coordination.
2133	We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits. Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.
2430	We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques. Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is estimated to be a few nK.
3516	Through polarization observations masers are unique probes of the magnetic field in a variety of different astronomical objects, with the different maser species tracing different physical conditions. In recent years maser polarization observations have provided insights in the magnetic field strength and morphology in, among others, the envelopes around evolved stars, Planetary Nebulae (PNe), massive star forming regions and supernova remnants. More recently, maser observations have even been used to determine the magnetic field in megamaser galaxies. This review will present an overview of maser polarization observations and magnetic field determinations of the last several years and discuss the implications of the magnetic field measurements for several important fields of study, such as aspherical PNe creation and massive star formation.
1243	GREGOR is a new open solar telescope with an aperture of 1.5m. It replaces the former 45-cm Gregory Coude telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The optical concept is that of a double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical mirrors are made from a silicon-carbide material with high thermal conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the near infrared and a 2-dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Perot interferometers for the visible.
3656	This research paper focuses on the study of the spectroscopic properties of polarons in strongly correlated systems using the Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method. The primary theme of the research is to understand the electronic structure and dynamics of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions. The study finds that the polaronic effects are enhanced in strongly correlated systems, leading to a significant change in the spectral properties of the material. The Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method is shown to be a powerful tool for investigating the polaronic effects in strongly correlated systems. The research provides important insights into the behavior of polarons in materials with strong electron-electron interactions, which can be useful for designing new materials with desired electronic properties.
3790	This research paper investigates the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of x-ray linear dichroism in Co/FeMn bilayers. The study aims to understand the magnetic properties of the bilayers and explore their potential for use in magnetic devices. The results show a significant difference in the anisotropy of the two layers, with the Co layer exhibiting a much larger anisotropy than the FeMn layer. This finding suggests that Co/FeMn bilayers have strong potential for use in spintronic devices that require high magnetic anisotropy. The research paper concludes that the study provides valuable insights into the magnetic properties of Co/FeMn bilayers and their potential applications in technology.
1242	"The research paper titled ""Quantisations of piecewise affine maps on the torus and their quantum limits"" explores the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus. The paper focuses on the quantisation of these maps and their corresponding quantum limits. The authors establish a connection between the classical and quantum dynamics of these maps, using tools from algebraic geometry and quantum mechanics. They show that the quantum limits of these maps are determined by their classical dynamics and provide explicit examples to illustrate their results. Overall, the paper provides a framework for understanding the quantum limits of piecewise affine maps on the torus and sheds light on the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics."
1639	This research paper investigates the application of maximum entropy methods to infer the physical parameters of core-collapse supernovae from gravitational wave data. The main focus is on the improvement of the accuracy of parameter estimation by incorporating prior information and using the maximum entropy principle. The authors present a novel approach for data analysis that allows for the identification of the waveforms associated with specific physical processes, which could lead to more accurate predictions of astrophysical events. The crucial findings of this study highlight the effectiveness of maximum entropy methods for gravitational wave data analysis and the potential for improving our understanding of core-collapse supernovae.
63	The field of astronomy is constantly evolving with new discoveries and advancements in technology. However, the limited funding and resources allocated to the astronomical community have hindered its progress. In this research paper, a modest proposal is presented to address this issue. The proposal suggests a collaborative effort between government agencies, private organizations, and individual donors to establish a sustainable funding model for the astronomical community. The paper also discusses the potential benefits of this proposal, including increased research opportunities and a more comprehensive understanding of the universe. Furthermore, the proposal emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in the distribution of funds. The research paper concludes by acknowledging the challenges associated with implementing such a proposal but highlights the importance of investing in the advancement of astronomy for the betterment of society as a whole.
1752	We investigate the behavior of the directed current in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions driven by local periodic potentials in the forward as well in backscattering channels. We treat the problem with Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We present the exact solution for the case of an infinite wire and show that in this case the dc current vanishes identically. We also investigate a confined system consistent in an annular arrangement coupled to a particle reservoir. We present a perturbative treatment that allows for the analytical expressions of the dc current in the lowest order of the amplitudes of the potential. We also present results obtained from the exact numerical solution of the problem.
3757	Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices.
288	In this paper, we study the moduli space of toric vector bundles over a toric variety. We provide a detailed analysis of the geometry and topology of the moduli space, and establish several important results. Specifically, we show that the moduli space is smooth and projective, and that it admits a natural stratification by stability conditions. Additionally, we establish a connection between the moduli space and the combinatorial structure of the associated toric fan. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between geometry and combinatorics in the theory of toric varieties, and offer new insights into the properties of toric vector bundles.
452	This research paper investigates the flow instabilities of magnetic flux tubes, focusing on longitudinal flow. In particular, we explore the effects of various parameters, such as the magnetic field strength and plasma density, on the development and behavior of these instabilities. Using numerical simulations and analytical approaches, we demonstrate that longitudinal flow can lead to complex dynamics, including the formation of waves and shocks, and can significantly impact the transport of energy and mass in the plasma. Our results have important implications for understanding the behavior of magnetic flux tubes in a range of astrophysical environments, from the solar corona to accretion disks around black holes.
3802	This research paper focuses on the reliability of the direction of incident neutrinos in fully contained and partially contained events due to Quasi-Elastic (QEL) interactions in the Super-Kamiokande detector. The study analyzes the data obtained from the detector to determine the accuracy of the direction reconstruction and the impact of QEL interactions on the reliability of the results. The findings show that the direction reconstruction for fully contained events is more reliable than for partially contained events due to the higher energy deposition in the former. However, the study suggests that the accuracy of the direction reconstruction can be improved by applying appropriate correction techniques. These results have important implications for future neutrino experiments and their ability to accurately determine the direction of incident neutrinos.
2070	This paper aims to investigate the potential connection between cosmic gamma ray anomalies and dark matter decay. Cosmic gamma ray anomalies have been observed in various regions of the universe, and their origin remains unknown. One possible explanation is that they are the result of the decay of dark matter particles. This paper examines the possibility of dark matter decay as a solution to cosmic gamma ray anomalies by analyzing data from gamma ray telescopes and simulations of dark matter decay. The results of this study will provide insight into the nature of dark matter and its potential role in cosmic gamma ray anomalies.
840	The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level, where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups. Our findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under tension.
2783	The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction [ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy. Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate for the high-density electron gas.
2014	We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.
1417	We analyze the scaling parameter, extracted from the fidelity for two different ground states, for the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse field near the critical point. It is found that, in the thermodynamic limit, the scaling parameter is singular, and the derivative of its logarithmic function with respect to the transverse field strength is logarithmically divergent at the critical point. The scaling behavior is confirmed numerically by performing a finite size scaling analysis for systems of different sizes, consistent with the conformal invariance at the critical point. This allows us to extract the correlation length critical exponent, which turns out to be universal in the sense that the correlation length critical exponent does not depend on either the anisotropic parameter or the transverse field strength.
3526	The conditions for proper definitions in mathematics are given, in terms of the theory of definition, on the basis of the criterions of eliminability and non-creativity. As a definition, Russell's antinomy is a violation of the criterion of eliminability (Behmann, 1931; Bochvar, 1943). Following the path of the criterion of non-creativity, this paper develops a new analysis of Comprehension schema and, as a consequence, proof that Russell's antinomy argumentation, despite the words of Frege himself, does not hold in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik. According to Basic Law (III), the class of classes not belonging to themselves is a class defined by a function which can not take as argument its own course of value. In other words, the class of classes not belonging to themselves is a class whose classes are not identical to the class itself.
1405	In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal) DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental redundancy.
2557	This paper presents a study of the white dwarf binary system GD 362. Using high-resolution spectroscopy and photometric observations, we investigate the possibility of a merger event in the past of this system. We analyze the chemical composition and kinematics of the system and compare them with theoretical models of binary white dwarf mergers. Our results suggest that GD 362 is a product of a binary white dwarf merger, providing new evidence for the importance of these events in the formation and evolution of white dwarfs. The paper highlights the significance of studying binary white dwarf systems to further understand the astrophysical processes that govern the evolution of stars and the formation of compact objects.
2450	Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.
2944	The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen, ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed. Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals, reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
4008	The migration of giant planets in viscous power-law discs has been a topic of intense research in the field of astrophysics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the migration process, considering the effects of viscosity and disc density profiles. Using numerical simulations, we find that the migration of giant planets is strongly dependent on the disc viscosity and density slope. Our results show that highly viscous discs promote inward migration, while steep density profiles tend to inhibit it. We also observe the formation of planet traps in regions of the disc where the migration is slowed down, which can lead to the accumulation of multiple planets. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of giant planet migration in protoplanetary discs and sheds light on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
856	Motivated by applications to quantum field theory we consider Gibbs measures for which the reference measure is Wiener measure and the interaction is given by a double stochastic integral and a pinning external potential. In order properly to characterize these measures through DLR equations, we are led to lift Wiener measure and other objects to a space of configurations where the basic observables are not only the position of the particle at all times but also the work done by test vector fields. We prove existence and basic properties of such Gibbs measures in the small coupling regime by means of cluster expansion.

Overall, the research sheds light on the behavior of network growth and provides insights into the role of preferential attachment in shaping network structure.
2624	This research paper presents a novel approach to the fabrication of analog electronics for serial readout of silicon strip sensors. The proposed method involves the integration of a custom-designed ASIC with the sensor, thereby reducing the number of readout channels required and minimizing power consumption. The fabrication process was optimized to achieve high yield and reliability, and the resulting system was characterized for performance.

2694	We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of the standard field-theoretical treatment of vacuum energy and discuss the relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous symmetry breaking. We suggest possible extensions of the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis symmetry, in particular, its complexification till duality symmetry and discuss the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be responsible for a small observable value of this constant.
3392	The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be defined for each such manifestation.

658	This research paper focuses on the effects of extragalactic background light (EBL) on cascading in the universe. The study utilizes numerical simulations to demonstrate how the presence of EBL can affect the propagation and scattering of high-energy photons from distant sources. The results indicate that EBL can significantly impact the observed spectra of gamma-ray sources, with implications for our understanding of the universe's evolution and the nature of high-energy astrophysical processes. The study concludes that a more comprehensive understanding of EBL is essential for accurately interpreting observations of extragalactic gamma-ray sources and for improving our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties.
756	This research paper investigates the role of entanglement, fidelity and topological entropy in a quantum phase transition to topological order. Through the use of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these measures can effectively capture the transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase. Our results indicate that the topological entropy is a robust measure that is able to detect the transition, while the fidelity enables us to pinpoint the critical point of the transition. Additionally, we show that the entanglement entropy can be used to characterize the different phases. These findings provide insights into the nature of quantum phase transitions and the role of entanglement in topological order.
197	The authors apply three methods of prospective modelling to high resolution georeferenced land cover data in a Mediterranean mountain area: GIS approach, non linear parametric model and neuronal network. Land cover prediction to the latest known date is used to validate the models. In the frame of spatial-temporal dynamics in open systems results are encouraging and comparable. Correct prediction scores are about 73 %. The results analysis focuses on geographic location, land cover categories and parametric distance to reality of the residues. Crossing the three models show the high degree of convergence and a relative similitude of the results obtained by the two statistic approaches compared to the GIS supervised model. Steps under work are the application of the models to other test areas and the identification of respective advantages to develop an integrated model.
1782	"In this work, we study the size of the particles involved in a powder snow avalanche phenomenon. To determine these sizes, we study all the phenomena the particles have to face before arriving in the ""body"" of the avalanche. We study the boundary layer which is at the bottom of the avalanche. We determine, with the help of experimental data, the range of size of the particles that can be entrained by the avalanche. We then examine the possibility for these particles to reach the top of the boundary layer, and so to take part in the avalanche. Our final result is that the more frequent particles suspended in a powder snow avalanche have a size lower than 200 micrometers."
2499	This research paper proposes a novel linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model of self-synchronizing oscillators. By introducing a linear transformation, the model is shown to be more tractable and amenable to analysis. The proposed reformulation is applied to a variety of scenarios, including networks with heterogeneous coupling strengths and non-identical oscillator frequencies. The results demonstrate that the reformulated model accurately predicts synchronization behavior, and allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive self-synchronization.

3184	We introduce a procedure developed by the ``Teramo Stellar Populations Tools'' group (Teramo-SPoT), specifically optimized to obtain realistic simulations of CCD images of elliptical galaxies. Particular attention is devoted to include the Surface Brightness Fluctuation (SBF) signal observed in ellipticals and to simulate the Globular Cluster (GC) system in the galaxy, and the distribution of background galaxies present in real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated objects - galaxy distance and brightness profile, luminosity function of GC and background galaxies, etc. - the tool presented allows the user to set some of the main instrumental properties - FoV, zero point magnitude, exposure time, etc.
2008	"The research paper titled ""Hedging our bets: the expected contribution of species to future phylogenetic diversity"" examines the expected contribution of different species to the future of phylogenetic diversity. The study uses a novel approach to estimate the expected contribution of species based on their evolutionary distinctiveness and extinction risk. The research reveals that some species, even if they are not currently endangered, may have a more significant impact on future phylogenetic diversity than others. The paper concludes that conservation efforts should focus not only on currently endangered species but also on those with high potential for future contributions to phylogenetic diversity."
3940	The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.
D2-40	An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways.
1997	Infrared-Faint Radio Sources represent a new and unexpected class of object which is bright at radio wavelengths but unusually faint at infrared wavelengths. If, like most mJy radio sources, they were either conventional active or star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, we would expect them to be detectable at infrared wavelengths, and so their non-detection by the Spitzer Space Telescope is surprising. Here we report the detection of one of these sources using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, from which we conclude that the sources are driven by Active Galactic Nuclei. We suggest that these sources are either normal radio-loud quasars at high redshift or abnormally obscured radio galaxies.
2143	"Using the previously derived confining gluon propagator, the corresponding system of equations determining the quark propagator is derived. The system of equations consists of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator itself, which includes the zero momentum transfer quark-gluon vertex. It is complemented by the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this vertex. The quark equation depends explicitly on the mass gap, determining the scale of the truly nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state. The obtained system of equations is manifestly gauge-invariant, i.e., does not depend explicitly on the gauge-fixing parameter. It is also free from all the types of the perturbative contributions (""contaminations""), which may appear at the fundamental quark-gluon level."
2197	This research paper explores the relationship between evolutionary dynamics and network dynamics, with a focus on how these two processes can be unified to better understand complex systems. The paper argues that understanding the interplay between these two processes can provide new insights into the evolution of social behavior, the emergence of cooperation, and the spread of infectious diseases. The paper presents several case studies that illustrate the potential of this approach, including studies of the evolution of cooperation in microbial populations and the dynamics of epidemics in human populations. The main conclusion of the paper is that a unified approach to evolutionary and network dynamics has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems and to inform the development of effective interventions for a range of social and health problems.
3164	Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.
2689	"The research paper titled ""Generalized characteristic polynomials of graph bundles"" explores the concept of graph bundles and their characteristic polynomials. The paper presents a generalized notion of characteristic polynomials for graph bundles, which can be used to study the topology and geometry of these bundles. The authors also provide several examples of graph bundles and their associated characteristic polynomials. The main conclusion of the paper is that the generalized characteristic polynomials of graph bundles can be used to understand the structure and behavior of these bundles, and can be used to study their properties in a variety of contexts. The paper provides important insights into the study of graph bundles and their characteristic polynomials, and is an important contribution to the field of mathematics."
1251	The configuration space network (CSN) of a dynamical system is an effective approach to represent the ensemble of configurations sampled during a simulation and their dynamic connectivity. To elucidate the connection between the CSN topology and the underlying free-energy landscape governing the system dynamics and thermodynamics, an analytical soluti on is provided to explain the heavy tail of the degree distribution, neighbor co nnectivity and clustering coefficient. This derivation allows to understand the universal CSN network topology observed in systems ranging from a simple quadratic well to the native state of the beta3s peptide and a 2D lattice heteropolymer. Moreover CSN are shown to fall in the general class of complex networks describe d by the fitness model.
3614	We report on use of a radiation pressure induced restoring force, the optical spring effect, to optically dilute the mechanical damping of a 1 gram suspended mirror, which is then cooled by active feedback (cold damping). Optical dilution relaxes the limit on cooling imposed by mechanical losses, allowing the oscillator mode to reach a minimum temperature of 6.9 mK, a factor of ~40000 below the environmental temperature. A further advantage of the optical spring effect is that it can increase the number of oscillations before decoherence by several orders of magnitude. In the present experiment we infer an increase in the dynamical lifetime of the state by a factor of ~200.
1980	This research paper conducts a comparative analysis between two popular methods, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Langevin thermostats, for out-of-equilibrium simulations of polymeric systems. The primary focus is to determine the accuracy and efficiency of each method in reproducing non-equilibrium behavior of polymeric systems. The study reveals that both methods can effectively simulate non-equilibrium behavior, but DPD is more accurate and efficient in capturing the complex dynamics of polymeric systems, particularly for systems with high molecular weight. The findings of this research have significant implications for the design and optimization of polymeric materials for various applications.
52	This research paper presents a performance analysis for multichannel reception of Orthogonal Offset Frequency Shift Keying (OOFSK) signaling. The main theme of the study is to investigate the impact of the number of channels on the system's performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and throughput. The researchers conducted simulations using different numbers of channels and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The results show that increasing the number of channels improves the system's performance, particularly at low SNRs. However, the improvement in BER saturates beyond a certain number of channels. Furthermore, the study also reveals that increasing the number of channels may not necessarily lead to an increase in throughput. The research provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of multichannel communication systems using OOFSK signaling.
2214	As the likely birthplaces of planets and an essential conduit for the buildup of stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in star and planet formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest because of their ability to probe the dynamics, physical and chemical structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such studies to, e.g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks. Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the physical processes governing star and planet formation.
3476	We present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of single-layer graphene crystals examined under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The samples, with lateral dimensions on the micron scale, were prepared on a silicon dioxide surface by direct exfoliation of single crystal graphite. The single-layer films were identified using Raman spectroscopy. Topographic images of single-layer samples display the honeycomb structure expected for the full hexagonal symmetry of an isolated graphene monolayer. The absence of observable defects in the STM images is indicative of the high quality of these films. Crystals comprised of a few layers of graphene were also examined. They exhibited dramatically different STM topography, displaying the reduced three-fold symmetry characteristic of the surface of bulk graphite.

The results indicate that the proposed methodology achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost and provides accurate solutions for the optimal shape design problem. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering minimax differentiability in the design optimization process for Stokes flow systems. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the optimal shape design for Stokes flow and offers a promising approach for future research in fluid mechanics and optimization.
1476	Experiments built to search for neutrinoless double beta-decay are limited in their sensitivity not only by the exposure but also by the amount of background encountered. Radioactive isotopes in the surrounding of the detectors which emit gamma-radiation are expected to be a significant source of background in the GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA. Methods to select electron induced events and discriminate against photon induced events inside a germanium detector are presented in this paper. The methods are based on the analysis of the time structure of the detector response. Data were taken with a segmented GERDA prototype detector. It is shown that the analysis of the time response of the detector can be used to distinguish multiply scattered photons from electrons.
973	This research paper explores the use of geometry and topology in the study of relativistic cosmology. The primary theme is to investigate the mathematical structures that underpin the current understanding of the universe and how they relate to observations. The paper reviews the fundamental concepts of general relativity and cosmology, including the Friedmann equations and the cosmic microwave background radiation. It then discusses the role of geometry and topology in interpreting these concepts, with a particular focus on the spatial curvature of the universe and the topology of cosmic structures. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research in this field and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe.
1265	We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.
2469	Disk instability is an attractive yet controversial means for the rapid formation of giant planets in our solar system and elsewhere. Recent concerns regarding the first adiabatic exponent of molecular hydrogen gas are addressed and shown not to lead to spurious clump formation in the author's disk instability models. A number of disk instability models have been calculated in order to further test the robustness of the mechanism, exploring the effects of changing the pressure equation of state, the vertical temperature profile, and other parameters affecting the temperature distribution. Possible reasons for differences in results obtained by other workers are discussed. Disk instability remains as a plausible formation mechanism for giant planets.
2663	"The research paper titled ""Path integrals for stiff polymers applied to membrane physics"" aimed to develop a new method for simulating the behavior of stiff polymers in biological membranes. The researchers utilized a mathematical technique known as path integrals to model the movement of these polymers, which are critical components of cell membranes. The study found that the path integral approach allowed for more accurate modeling of the behavior of stiff polymers in membranes compared to previous methods. This led to new insights into the role of these polymers in membrane structure and function, which could have implications for understanding disease states such as cancer. Overall, the research paper demonstrates the potential of path integrals as a powerful tool for studying the complex physics of biological membranes and the polymers that make them up."
3356	This research paper investigates the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on quantum coherence in a differential charge qubit. By analyzing the behavior of the qubit under various conditions, we observe that quasiparticle poisoning can significantly degrade the coherence of the system. Our results show that the coherence time of the qubit decreases exponentially with increasing quasiparticle density. Furthermore, we find that the impact of quasiparticle poisoning is more severe in the case of the differential charge qubit compared to the standard charge qubit. This study provides valuable insights into the sources of decoherence in quantum systems and highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of quasiparticle poisoning in the design of quantum devices.
2588	The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference, allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.
774	This research paper explores disparities in the Josephson vortex state electrodynamics of high-Tc cuprates. Using experimental techniques, the authors investigate the differences in behavior between various high-Tc cuprate materials in the Josephson vortex state, which is a critical phenomenon in the physics of superconductivity. The authors found that there are significant variations in the behavior of different high-Tc cuprates in the Josephson vortex state, and these disparities may be related to the materials' fundamental properties. These findings have implications for the development of new superconducting materials and technologies. Overall, this research sheds light on an important aspect of high-Tc cuprate physics and provides valuable insights into the behavior of these materials.
930	"The research paper ""Vocabulary growth in collaborative tagging systems"" examines how collaborative tagging systems contribute to the growth of vocabulary. The study analyzed a dataset of tags from Delicious, a social bookmarking platform, and found that new tags were more likely to be created by low-frequency taggers and that the vocabulary growth rate was higher in the early stages of the system's development. The study also found that the use of synonym tags decreased over time, indicating that users were converging on a shared vocabulary. The paper concludes that collaborative tagging systems are effective at facilitating vocabulary growth and can be a valuable resource for language learning and knowledge management."
2323	"We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation, based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The temperature in such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation of vortex motion in superfluids."
2255	This paper presents an algebraic generalization of Kripke structures, which are commonly used in modal logic to model systems with multiple states. By introducing an algebraic structure based on the lattice of sub-formulas of a given formula, the authors are able to capture the essence of Kripke structures in a more abstract and flexible way. The paper provides a formal definition of this algebraic structure, explores its properties and relationships with other modal logics, and shows how it can be used to reason about complex systems. The authors conclude that their algebraic generalization provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing a wide range of systems, including those that cannot be adequately represented by traditional Kripke structures.
1508	We study atom scattering from two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates using a position sensitive, time resolved, single atom detector. In analogy to quantum optics, the process can also be thought of as spontaneous, degenerate four wave mixing of de Broglie waves. We find a clear correlation between atoms with opposite momenta, demonstrating pair production in the scattering process. We also observe a Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation for collinear momenta, which permits an independent measurement of the size of the pair production source and thus the size of the spatial mode. The back to back pairs occupy very nearly two oppositely directed spatial modes, a promising feature for future quantum optics experiments.
833	We perform a non-perturbative sum over geometries in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity model given in terms of Causal Dynamical Triangulations. Inspired by the concept of triangulations of product type introduced previously, we impose an additional notion of order on the discrete, causal geometries. This simplifies the combinatorial problem of counting geometries just enough to enable us to calculate the transfer matrix between boundary states labelled by the area of the spatial universe, as well as the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian of the continuum theory. This is the first time in dimension larger than two that a Hamiltonian has been derived from such a model by mainly analytical means, and opens the way for a better understanding of scaling and renormalization issues.
1104	"The article ""Transverse LS-Category for Riemannian Foliations"" focuses on the study of Riemannian foliations, which are a type of geometric structure that can be used to describe certain types of smooth manifolds. The article introduces a new concept called the transverse LS-category, which is a measure of the complexity of the foliation in terms of the topology of the transverse space. The article provides several results and examples of how the transverse LS-category can be used to understand the structure of Riemannian foliations. Noteworthy outcomes include the development of new tools for studying Riemannian foliations, and the identification of new classes of foliations with interesting geometric properties. Overall, the article contributes to the field of differential geometry and provides a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of Riemannian foliations."
2957	The Flory-Huggins theory has been widely used to predict the solubility of polymers in solution. However, this theory has limited applicability to heterogeneously-modified polymers due to the lack of a clear understanding of the intermolecular interactions of the modified segments. This paper explores the use of the Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified polymers and proposes modifications to the theory to account for these interactions. The study includes both theoretical and experimental approaches to validate the proposed modifications and demonstrates the improved accuracy of the modified Flory-Huggins theory in predicting the solubility behavior of heterogeneously-modified polymers. This research provides insight into the behavior of complex polymer systems and could have implications for the design of new materials with tailored properties.
3605	This research paper focuses on the estimation of heavy flavour production in hadron-hadron colliders. The study aims to provide an understanding of the production mechanisms of single and double diffractive heavy flavours in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. The research is based on the theoretical framework of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Monte Carlo simulations. The paper presents the results of the estimation of the cross-sections and differential distributions for the production of charm and bottom quarks in single and double diffractive processes. The analysis includes a comparison of the results with experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. The study is expected to contribute to the overall understanding of heavy flavour production in hadron-hadron collisions and provide insights for future collider experiments.
3074	This research paper presents an empirical analysis and statistical modeling of attack processes based on honeypots. The study involved collecting data from honeypots deployed in a production network environment and analyzing the observed attack patterns. The authors developed a statistical model to describe the attack processes and used it to simulate different attack scenarios. The study found that the most common attack methods were brute-force attacks, port scanning, and web application attacks. The authors also found that attackers tend to target specific vulnerabilities and that the majority of attacks come from a small number of IP addresses. The statistical model developed in the study can be used to predict the likelihood of different types of attacks and can assist in the development of effective countermeasures.
2338	This research paper investigates the substrate-induced bandgap in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The primary objective is to understand how the interaction between graphene and h-BN affects the electronic properties of graphene. The findings of this study reveal that the presence of h-BN induces a bandgap in graphene, which can be controlled by varying the thickness of the h-BN layer. In addition, the researchers demonstrate that the strength of the interaction between graphene and h-BN can be manipulated through chemical functionalization of the h-BN surface. Overall, this research provides new insights into the fundamental properties of graphene and h-BN and has potential applications in the development of nanoelectronic devices.
1478	We study the magnetotransport in small hybrid junctions formed by high-mobility GaInAs/InP heterostructures coupled to superconducting (S) and normal metal (N) terminals. Highly transmissive superconducting contacts to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) located in a GaInAs/InP heterostructure are realized by using a Au/NbN layer system. The magnetoresistance of the S/2DEG/N structures is studied as a function of dc bias current and temperature. At bias currents below a critical value, the resistance of the S/2DEG/N structures develops a strong oscillatory dependence on the magnetic field, with an amplitude of the oscillations considerably larger than that of the reference N/2DEG/N structures. The experimental results are qualitatively explained by taking Andreev reflection in high magnetic fields into account.
D2-8	Fossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked Protoceratops skulls were common as fossils. A later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals.  He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations,  which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxon.
1363	These are the notes for a set of lectures delivered by the two authors at the Les Houches Summer School on `Complex Systems' in July 2006. They provide an introduction to the basic concepts in modern (probabilistic) coding theory, highlighting connections with statistical mechanics. We also stress common concepts with other disciplines dealing with similar problems that can be generically referred to as `large graphical models'. While most of the lectures are devoted to the classical channel coding problem over simple memoryless channels, we present a discussion of more complex channel models. We conclude with an overview of the main open challenges in the field.
3416	In a supersolid, the atoms are arranged in a regular pattern like a solid, but they also flow like a superfluid. This unique state of matter has been studied extensively, and this research focuses on the elementary excitations within a supersolid. Elementary excitations are the vibrations and movements of the atoms within the material, and they play a crucial role in understanding its properties. The study used a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to investigate these excitations and their behavior in a supersolid. The research found that the excitations in a supersolid are different from those in a typical solid or superfluid and are characterized by a lower energy and longer lifetime. The findings provide important insights into the fundamental properties of a supersolid and could have implications for the development of new materials and technologies.
2173	"The research paper titled ""New Jarlskog determinant from Physics above the GUT Scale"" explores the Jarlskog invariant in the context of physics beyond the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale. The Jarlskog invariant is a measure of CP violation in the quark sector of the Standard Model of particle physics. The authors propose a generalization of the Jarlskog determinant that takes into account the existence of new physics beyond the GUT scale. They conclude that this new determinant could have important implications for understanding CP violation in the early universe and for the search for new physics at high-energy colliders. Overall, the paper provides new insights into the fundamental nature of CP violation in particle physics and the potential impact of new physics beyond the GUT scale."

Using theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, we investigate the behavior of the excitonic states and their optical transitions in a quantum well structured material. Our findings reveal the manifestation of hidden symmetry in the optical transitions of the excitonic states, which leads to the emergence of new optical selection rules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the role of excitonic interactions and confinement effects in shaping the excitonic spectra and transitions. Our results provide insights into the fundamental properties of two-dimensional excitons in quantum wells and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
D2-84	Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life, offering critical insights into Earth's history and evolution. They provide evidence of extinct species, helping scientists reconstruct past ecosystems and understand how life has changed over millions of years. Fossils reveal how species adapted, evolved, or became extinct, shedding light on the processes of natural selection and environmental changes. Additionally, they are used to date rock layers and determine the age of geological formations, aiding in the study of Earth's geologic timeline. Fossils also provide clues about ancient climates and environmental conditions, helping researchers understand past climate changes and their impacts. By studying fossils, we gain a deeper understanding of life's diversity, the history of our planet.
1162	We study spin-polarized transient transport in a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads subjected to a rectangular bias voltage pulse. Time-dependent spin-resolved currents, occupations, spin accumulation, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated using both nonequilibrium Green function and master equation techniques. Both parallel and antiparallel leads' magnetization alignments are analyzed. Our main findings are: a dynamical spin accumulation that changes sign in time, a short-lived pulse of spin polarized current in the emitter lead (but not in the collector lead), and a dynamical TMR that develops negative values in the transient regime. We also observe that the intra-dot Coulomb interaction can enhance even further the negative values of the TMR.
3849	The paper explores the transresistivity of quantum Hall double layers near the filling factor $\nu=1/2$. The authors investigate Fermi-liquid effects and their impact on the transresistivity in this system. They employ a theoretical model to study the dependence of the transresistivity on temperature and magnetic field. The main focus of the paper is to understand the nature of the electron interactions in the double layers and their effects on the transport properties. The authors conclude that Fermi-liquid effects play a significant role in the transresistivity near $\nu=1/2$ and that their model provides a good description of the experimental observations.
1107	The CALICE collaboration is presently constructing a test hadron calorimeter (HCAL) with 7620 scintillator tiles read out by novel photo-detectors - Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). This prototype is the first device which uses SiPMs on a large scale. We present the design of the HCAL and report on measured properties of more than 10 thousand SiPMs. We discuss the SiPM efficiency, gain, cross-talk, and noise rate dependence on bias voltage and temperature, including the spread in these parameters. We analyze the reasons for SiPM rejection and present the results of the long term stability studies. The first measurements of the SiPM radiation hardness are presented. We compare properties of SiPM with the properties of similar devices, MRS APD and MPPC. A possibility to make the tiles thinner and to read them out without WLS fibers has been studied.
520	This research paper explores large deviation principles for partition functions of directed polymers and other models in an independent and identically distributed (IID) field. We investigate the behavior of partition functions in the presence of random fluctuations and derive asymptotic estimates for the probability of large deviations. Our results demonstrate that the large deviation principle plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of these models in the thermodynamic limit. We apply our findings to several specific models and provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical results. Our research sheds light on the fundamental properties of directed polymers and related models, and may have important implications for a wide range of physical and mathematical applications.
306	In this paper, we investigate a new waveform for UWB systems obtained by the combination of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The proposed system, called Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple Access (SS-MC-MA) turns out to be a judicious solution to combat frequency selectivity and narrowband interferers, and to manage the coexistence of several users and piconets. It is shown that the addition of a degree of freedom brought by the spreading component of SS-MC-MA allows to optimize jointly the assignment of the number of used codes and coding rates in order to make the system more robust. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the new system can outperform Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA) for low data rates and is able to provide wider range of rates.
1160	The paper focuses on studying the evolution of interstellar clouds in a streaming hot plasma, taking into account the effects of heat conduction. The authors use a series of simulations to examine the behavior of the clouds under various conditions and parameters. The results of the simulations indicate that heat conduction has a significant impact on the evolution of the clouds. In particular, it can lead to the formation of shock fronts and the destruction of the cloud material. The authors also found that the relative velocities of the cloud and plasma, as well as the strength of the magnetic fields, play important roles in determining the behavior of the system. Overall, the paper provides insights into the complex dynamics of interstellar clouds in a hot plasma environment and highlights the importance of considering heat conduction in such systems.
1837	We present imaging data and photometry for the COSMOS survey in 15 photometric bands between 0.3um and 2.4um. These include data taken on the Subaru 8.3m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes, and the CFHT 3.6m telescope. Special techniques are used to ensure that the relative photometric calibration is better than 1% across the field of view. The absolute photometric accuracy from standard star measurements is found to be 6%. The absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors accurate to 2% or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with the expected values. Finally, as the first step in the scientific analysis of these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving.
1559	"The thermodynamics of black holes is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. This reformulation is shown to be invariant with respect to Legendre transformations, and to allow several equivalent representations. Legendre invariance allows us to explain a series of contradictory results known in the literature from the use of Weinhold's and Ruppeiner's thermodynamic metrics for black holes. For the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole the geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, showing a non trivial thermodynamic interaction, and the curvature contains information about critical points and phase transitions. On the contrary, for the Kerr black hole the geometry is flat and does not explain its phase transition structure."
1678	The core of the vortex in the Neel order parameter for an easy-plane antiferromagnet on honeycomb lattice is demonstrated to bind two zero-energy states. Remarkably, a single electron occupying this mid-gap band has its spin fragmented between the two sublattices: Whereas it yields a vanishing total magnetization it shows a finite Neel order, orthogonal to the one of the assumed background. The requisite easy-plane anisotropy may be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer, for example. The results are relevant for spin-1/2 fermions on graphene's or optical honeycomb lattice, in the strongly interacting regime.
D2-3	The feasibility of extraterrestrial life is a subject of intense scientific interest, supported by discoveries in astrobiology, planetary science, and extremophile research. While no direct evidence has been found, several factors suggest its plausibility. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some located in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery of extremophiles on Earth, thriving in extreme conditions such as deep-sea vents and frozen tundras, suggests that life could also adapt to harsh extraterrestrial environments like those on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus. Additionally, complex organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been detected in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, indicating that life’s fundamental chemistry is widespread.
2847	We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuum process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC) layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold friction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves are obtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. The obtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growth temperature.
3456	This research paper investigates the process of electromagnetic field quantization in magnetodielectric media with the presence of external charges. The primary focus is on developing a theoretical framework for quantization in such media, as well as examining the behavior of electromagnetic fields in magnetodielectric materials. The study also explores the fundamental principles of electromagnetic theory and their implications for quantization, with an emphasis on the role of external charges. The results of the research provide insights into the nature of electromagnetic fields in magnetodielectric media and their interaction with external charges, with potential applications in a wide range of fields, including materials science and engineering.
1969	The research paper investigates the particles associated with omega produced at intermediate p_T. The study was conducted using data collected by the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The primary goal was to understand the production mechanisms of omega particles in high-energy collisions. The paper presents detailed measurements of the angular correlations between the omega particles and other particles in the event. The analysis revealed that the production of omega particles is influenced by both jet fragmentation and collective flow effects. The study also found that the production of omega particles at intermediate p_T is dominated by the decay of baryonic resonances. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the production mechanisms of omega particles and sheds light on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma created in high-energy collisions.
1705	This research paper investigates the connection between star-forming galaxies, AGN host galaxies, and early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The primary objective is to understand how these different types of galaxies are related and how their properties differ. The study uses a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data to analyze the galaxies' characteristics, including their stellar populations, morphology, and star formation rates. The results show that there is a significant correlation between the presence of active galactic nuclei and the properties of their host galaxies, such as their mass and morphology. Additionally, the study finds that early-type galaxies are generally less likely to have active star formation compared to star-forming and AGN host galaxies. These findings provide insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies and their different types.
1424	"The research paper titled ""Pseudo-localization of singular integrals and noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory"" explores the application of pseudo-localization techniques to singular integrals and noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory. The authors introduce a new type of pseudo-localization operator that allows for the decomposition of singular integrals into a sum of localized operators, which can then be analyzed using noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory. They also establish the boundedness of these localized operators on certain function spaces, providing a powerful tool for the study of singular integrals and related problems. The paper concludes with several applications of these techniques to problems in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Overall, this research provides new insights into the behavior of singular integrals and furthers our understanding of noncommutative Calderon-Zygmund theory."
2482	This research paper presents a study on the star formation history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using old main-sequence turnoff photometry. The study covers different fields within the SMC and aims to determine the constraints on the star formation history in these areas. The data was obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope, and the photometric analysis was conducted using the DAOPHOT II and ALLFRAME software packages. The results show variations in the star formation history among the different fields, with some areas having a more extended period of star formation than others. These findings provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the SMC and contribute to our understanding of stellar populations in nearby galaxies.
4050	The Veldkamp space of two-qubits is a mathematical object that describes the possible geometric arrangements of two qubits in a quantum system. In this paper, we explore the properties of this space and its applications in quantum information theory. We provide a detailed analysis of the structure and geometry of the Veldkamp space, including its symmetries and invariants. We also examine the relationship between the Veldkamp space and other important mathematical objects in quantum information theory, such as the Bloch sphere and the Pauli group. Our results demonstrate the utility of the Veldkamp space in characterizing the entanglement properties of two-qubit systems and in designing quantum error-correcting codes. Overall, our findings have important implications for the development of practical quantum technologies and the understanding of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
D1-5	According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller plates. These move continuously at a slow pace, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created). During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the theory of plate tectonics.
1989	"We perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the TIP5P model to quantify structural order in both the first shell (defined by four nearest neighbors)and second shell (defined by twelve next-nearest neighbors) of a central water molecule. We find the anomalous decrease of orientational order upon compression occurs in both shells, but the anomalous decrease of translational order upon compression occurs {\it mainly in the second shell}. The decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression (""structural anomaly"") are thus correlated only in the second shell. Our findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second shell upon compression."
3480	We have investigated the flux transfer characteristics of a switchable flux transformer comprising a superconducting loop and a DC superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID). This system can be used to couple multiple flux qubits with a controllable coupling strength. Its characteristics were measured using a flux input coil and a DC-SQUID for readout coupled to the transformer loop in a dilution refrigerator. The observed characteristics are consistent with the calculation results. We have demonstrated the reversal of the slope of the characteristics and the complete switching off of the transformer, which are useful features for its application as a controllable coupler for flux qubits.
298	Using former maps, geographers intend to study the evolution of the land cover in order to have a prospective approach on the future landscape; predictions of the future land cover, by the use of older maps and environmental variables, are usually done through the GIS (Geographic Information System). We propose here to confront this classical geographical approach with statistical approaches: a linear parametric model (polychotomous regression modeling) and a nonparametric one (multilayer perceptron). These methodologies have been tested on two real areas on which the land cover is known at various dates; this allows us to emphasize the benefit of these two statistical approaches compared to GIS and to discuss the way GIS could be improved by the use of statistical models.
3132	The search for gravitational-wave bursts in LIGO data from the fourth science run is an important topic in the field of astrophysics. This research paper aims to analyze and interpret the data received from LIGO in order to detect any gravitational-wave bursts that occurred during the fourth science run. The paper discusses the methods used for data analysis and the results obtained from the search. Notably, the research has identified several gravitational-wave bursts, which provide valuable insights into the nature of the universe. These findings contribute to our understanding of black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and other astrophysical events that produce gravitational waves. Overall, this research has significant implications for the field of astrophysics and may lead to further discoveries in the future.
3681	This research paper explores the concept of teleportation and its visualization in popular culture. Teleportation has been a popular theme in science fiction, with depictions ranging from simple matter transportation to more complex scenarios such as time and space travel. This paper examines how visual representations of teleportation have evolved over time, and how they reflect our changing understanding of the concept. It also investigates the impact of these visualizations on public perception and acceptance of teleportation as a potential future technology. Through an analysis of science fiction films, television shows, and literature, this paper aims to provide insights into the role of popular culture in shaping our ideas about technology and its potential applications.
689	We present here a detailed study of the behaviour of a three dimensional Brownian motor based on cold atoms in a double optical lattice [P. Sjolund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 190602 (2006)]. This includes both experiments and numerical simulations of a Brownian particle. The potentials used are spatially and temporally symmetric, but combined spatiotemporal symmetry is broken by phase shifts and asymmetric transfer rates between potentials. The diffusion of atoms in the optical lattices is rectified and controlled both in direction and speed along three dimensions. We explore a large range of experimental parameters, where irradiances and detunings of the optical lattice lights are varied within the dissipative regime. Induced drift velocities in the order of one atomic recoil velocity have been achieved.
1988	This research paper aims to investigate whether individuals perceive themselves as typical or atypical in comparison to others. A sample of 300 participants completed a survey measuring their self-perception of typicality across various domains such as personality, appearance, and behavior. Results revealed that the majority of participants perceived themselves as typical in most domains, with the exception of personality traits. Furthermore, individuals who perceived themselves as atypical reported lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of social anxiety. The findings suggest that individuals' self-perception of typicality plays a crucial role in their psychological well-being. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.
2164	We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions, that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells, are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar
1597	This research paper focuses on the van der Waals-like phase separation instability of a driven granular gas in three dimensions. The primary focus is on the behavior of the granular gas in the presence of external driving and how it affects the phase separation behavior. The study utilizes numerical simulations and analytical calculations to investigate the instability and its dependence on various parameters. The important outcomes of the study include the identification of a critical driving strength that triggers the instability, the discovery of a scaling relation between the driving strength and the characteristic length scale of the instability, and the observation of a transition from a continuous to a discontinuous phase separation. These findings provide insights into the fundamental physics of granular gases and may have practical implications for various engineering applications.
3609	This research paper focuses on measuring the density of Earth matter and testing the MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) theory. The MSW theory explains how neutrinos interact with matter as they travel through the Earth, affecting their oscillation patterns. The study used data from Super-Kamiokande, a neutrino observatory in Japan, to analyze the neutrino oscillation patterns and calculate the Earth matter density. The results showed that the MSW theory accurately predicted the oscillation patterns and provided a reliable estimate of the Earth matter density. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of neutrinos and the structure of the Earth's interior.
382	We have analyzed a large sample of numerically simulated clusters to demonstrate the adverse effects resulting from use of X-ray fitted beta-model parameters with Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) data. There is a fundamental incompatibility between model fits to X-ray surface brightness profiles and those done with SZE profiles. Since observational SZE radial profiles are in short supply, the X-ray parameters are often used in SZE analysis. We show that this leads to biased estimates of the integrated Compton y-parameter inside r_{500} calculated from clusters. We suggest a simple correction of the method, using a non-isothermal beta-model modified by a universal temperature profile, which brings these calculated quantities into closer agreement with the true values.
2821	Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.
3185	This research paper focuses on simulating CCD images of elliptical galaxies using a custom software package. The primary theme of the study is to investigate the effects of different galactic parameters on the resulting images, including the galaxy's size, ellipticity, and orientation. The significant findings of the study include the development of a method for accurately reproducing the observed properties of elliptical galaxies in CCD images, and the identification of specific combinations of galactic parameters that produce particularly realistic and informative images. The study concludes that simulations of CCD images can provide valuable insights into the physical properties of elliptical galaxies, and offers a promising avenue for future research in this area.
400	This research paper investigates the fundamental limits to position determination by concentration gradients. The use of concentration gradients has shown promising results in various applications, including biomedicine and environmental monitoring. However, the accuracy of position determination is limited by several factors, including the diffusion of particles and the sensitivity of sensors. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of these limitations, taking into account the properties of the gradient, the sensing mechanism, and the surrounding environment. The results show that the achievable accuracy is highly dependent on the specific application and the design parameters. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the development of more efficient and reliable concentration gradient-based position determination systems.
43	A recent radio survey of globular clusters has increased the number of millisecond pulsars drastically. M28 is now the globular cluster with the third largest population of known pulsars, after Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc. This prompted us to revisit the archival Chandra data on M28 to evaluate whether the newly discovered millisecond pulsars find a counterpart among the various X-ray sources detected in M28 previously. The radio position of PSR J1824-2452H is found to be in agreement with the position of CXC 182431-245217 while some faint unresolved X-ray emission near to the center of M28 is found to be coincident with the millisecond pulsars PSR J1824-2452G, J1824-2452J, J1824-2452I and J1824-2452E.
2336	This research paper examines the classical nucleation theory in ordering alloys precipitating with L12 structure. The study aims to understand the fundamental principles of nucleation and growth in these alloys through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental observations. The results show that the classical nucleation theory can accurately describe the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern the nucleation and growth of these materials. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the effects of lattice strain and chemical composition on the precipitation behavior of L12 alloys. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and growth of L12 precipitates in ordering alloys.
2470	This research paper aims to test the validity of disk instability models for giant planet formation. The study utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the outcomes of disk instability in a protoplanetary disk. The findings suggest that disk instability can indeed lead to the formation of giant planets, but the resulting planets have different characteristics compared to those formed through the more commonly accepted core accretion model. The researchers conclude that both disk instability and core accretion models are likely to contribute to giant planet formation in different environments and under different conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider both mechanisms when studying the formation of giant planets in protoplanetary disks.
965	Protein folding is a complex process that involves the search for the native state of a protein in its conformational space. The Wang-Landau molecular dynamics technique is a powerful method for exploring the low-energy conformational space of proteins. In this research paper, we present a detailed analysis of the application of the Wang-Landau method to study the conformational space of several proteins. We demonstrate that the Wang-Landau method is a highly efficient and accurate tool for searching for low-energy conformations of proteins. The results of our study provide important insights into the folding mechanism of proteins and have implications for the design of new drugs and therapies. Our findings suggest that the Wang-Landau molecular dynamics technique has the potential to become a valuable tool in the field of protein folding and drug discovery.
D2-39	Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s
3951	This research paper investigates the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of spin transfer torque and microwave generation in magnetic tunnel junctions utilizing a spin valve structure. The results show that the angular dependence of the spin transfer torque can be controlled by the shape of the magnetic tunnel junction, which affects the microwave generation without a magnetic field. The study concludes that the shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque is a significant factor in controlling microwave generation without a magnetic field, which has potential applications in spintronics and nanoelectronics.
1332	This work considers the problem of transmitting multiple compressible sources over a network at minimum cost. The aim is to find the optimal rates at which the sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they should be transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider networks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem is complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of distributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that is exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solvers inefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled with dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradient method and the proximal bundle method.
1585	This research paper examines the charge redistribution at interfaces between YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and various metals. The main points of the paper include the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to analyze the electronic structure and chemical composition of the interfaces. The results show that charge transfer occurs at the interface due to the formation of an interfacial layer. The thickness and chemical composition of this layer depend on the metal used and the preparation conditions. The paper also discusses the implications of these findings for the performance of YBCO-based electronic devices. The significant conclusion is that charge redistribution at YBCO-metal interfaces affects the electronic properties of the interface and must be carefully considered in the design of YBCO-based devices.
2854	This research paper investigates the mid-infrared fine structure line ratios in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using data obtained from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Specifically, the study explores the possibility of extinction by the torus, a dusty structure that surrounds the central black hole of AGN. The results suggest that the fine structure line ratios are consistent with extinction by the torus, supporting the idea that the torus plays a significant role in shaping the observed properties of AGN. This research sheds light on the complex interplay between the central engine and the surrounding environment in AGN, providing valuable insights into the physics of these powerful objects.
2249	This research paper explores the use of orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) in predicting the kinetic energy of electrons in condensed matter systems. OFDFT is a promising approach for studying large systems that are difficult to model using traditional DFT methods. This paper focuses on the development of kinetic potentials and ab-initio local pseudopotentials for OFDFT calculations. The accuracy of these potentials is evaluated by comparing them to experimental data and other theoretical methods. The results demonstrate the potential of OFDFT as a powerful tool for predicting the properties of materials and understanding their behavior at the atomic level.
2373	This research paper investigates the replica method in random matrix theory to study the vertices of the perturbative expansion of the theory. The primary objective of the study is to understand the role of replica symmetry breaking in the calculation of vertices, and to explore the implications of this phenomenon on the physical properties of the system. The analysis is based on a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, and the results reveal that replica symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of the vertices. The study also provides insights into the connection between vertices and correlation functions, which can be used to understand the physical properties of complex systems. Overall, the research highlights the importance of replica symmetry breaking in random matrix theory and provides new avenues for exploring the behavior of complex systems.
750	"The research paper titled ""Checking Equivalence of Quantum Circuits and States"" focuses on the problem of checking whether two given quantum circuits or states are equivalent. The authors propose a novel method called the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which can efficiently approximate any quantum circuit or state using a finite set of elementary gates. The algorithm is then used to check the equivalence of two circuits or states by comparing their approximations. The authors also provide a proof of the algorithm's correctness and analyze its time complexity. The main conclusion of the paper is that the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is an effective tool for checking the equivalence of quantum circuits and states, and can be used in a variety of applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing."
1910	The following question is addressed: under what conditions can a strange diffusive process, defined by a semi-dynamical V-Langevin equation or its associated Hybrid kinetic equation (HKE), be described by an equivalent purely stochastic process, defined by a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or by a Fractional Differential Equation (FDE)? More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived.
1155	In this paper, a hierarchical cross-layer design approach is proposed to increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity. Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy consumption.
585	This research paper explores the role of non-coding DNA in the expression of adaptation and its universal law. The study examines the relationship between non-coding DNA and gene regulation, and how it influences the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Through a detailed analysis of existing literature and empirical evidence, the paper highlights the importance of non-coding DNA in the evolution of species. The findings suggest that non-coding DNA plays a crucial role in the expression of adaptation, and that its function is governed by a universal law that applies to all living organisms. Overall, this research provides important insights into the mechanisms of evolution and the role of non-coding DNA in shaping the diversity of life on Earth.
832	The article presents an ergodic model for the expansion of spherical nanoplasmas, which is a fundamental process in laser-matter interactions. The model takes into account the non-equilibrium dynamics of the plasma, and considers the plasma expansion in the presence of an external magnetic field. The results show that the magnetic field can significantly affect the plasma expansion, leading to the formation of an anisotropic plasma cloud. The model also predicts the evolution of the plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field strength during the expansion process, providing insights into the underlying physics. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering the non-equilibrium dynamics and the role of external fields in understanding the expansion of nanoplasmas, which can have applications in areas such as plasma physics, materials science, and laser-based technologies.
416	This research paper investigates crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property. The Rokhlin property, a crucial concept in the theory of operator algebras, characterizes the existence of a certain type of projection in a crossed product. We analyze the conditions under which this property holds and provide examples of group actions that satisfy it. Our study yields significant consequences for the classification of operator algebras and the construction of non-commutative dynamical systems. In particular, we demonstrate that the Rokhlin property enables the decomposition of crossed products into simpler algebras, which facilitates their analysis and classification. Our findings contribute to the development of a deeper understanding of the structure and behavior of operator algebras and have implications for various areas of mathematics and physics.
D1-20	No level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even low levels of alcohol use can increase the risk of certain cancers and other health problems. While some guidelines suggest limits to reduce risks, these guidelines are based on minimizing risk rather than ensuring safety. Recent research indicates that even moderate drinking may increase the risk of chronic diseases and premature death compared to abstaining. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether. Alcohol consumption significantly impacts mental health, often exacerbating existing conditions and contributing to new ones. Alcohol initially acts as a depressant, reducing inhibitions and creating a temporary sense of relaxation or confidence.
1233	A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of a U(1) symmetry, this kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, similar to recently studied Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal nonlinear extension of quantum theory. A probabilistic interpretation (Born's rule) holds, provided the underlying model is scale free. Keywords: nonlinear functional Schroedinger equation, gauge symmetry, Newtonian gravity.
D2-16	Type 2 diabetes rates have risen dramatically worldwide since the 1980s, constituting a global health crisis. The prevalence has more than doubled over the past three decades, increasing from approximately 108 million adults in 1980 to over 537 million (10.5% of global adult population) by 2021. This surge has been particularly pronounced in middle-income countries experiencing rapid urbanization, with Pacific Islands and Middle Eastern nations showing the highest prevalence rates, while China and India have the largest absolute numbers. Key drivers include rising obesity rates, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, Westernization of diets, aging populations, and improved detection methods. While some high-income countries have shown signs of stabilization recently, global projections remain concerning, with cases expected to reach 783 million by 2045.
1762	"We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr\""odinger equation."
1575	This research paper explores the potential of using permutation codes as a basis for constructing space-time codes. By leveraging the properties of permutation codes, we propose a novel construction method for space-time codes that offers improved performance and reduced complexity compared to traditional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and show that our proposed space-time codes outperform existing codes in terms of bit error rate and outage probability. Our findings suggest that permutation codes can serve as a promising foundation for the development of space-time codes and pave the way for further research in this area.
3623	This research paper explores the notion of angles between infinite dimensional subspaces, specifically in the context of the Rayleigh-Ritz and alternating projectors methods. The primary theme is to investigate the relationship between these angles and the convergence rates of these two methods. The paper provides a theoretical framework for analyzing these angles and presents several significant findings. One important conclusion is that the convergence rate of the Rayleigh-Ritz method is related to the angle between the subspace generated by the eigenvectors of the matrix and the subspace generated by the trial vectors. Another key finding is that the alternating projectors method converges faster when the angle between the subspaces is smaller. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of these methods and provides insights into their performance in various applications.
615	"The research paper titled ""An Integrated Human-Computer System for Controlling Interstate Disputes"" proposes a system that combines human judgment and computer algorithms to facilitate the resolution of interstate disputes. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns, which are then presented to human judges who use their expertise to make informed decisions. The authors argue that this approach could help to reduce bias and increase the efficiency of dispute resolution. The paper concludes that the proposed integrated system has the potential to significantly improve the process of resolving interstate disputes, particularly those that involve complex data sets. However, the authors note that further research and development is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of this approach."

Overall, this research highlights the potential of large system analysis in developing efficient power control algorithms for CDMA networks.
892	Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a (modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the implications for faster-than light travel.
1400	This research paper investigates the concept of well-gradedness in a union-closed family and proposes a method for verifying and engineering this property. The study shows that the well-gradedness property can be used to identify optimal solutions in various scenarios, including voting systems and facility location problems. The proposed method utilizes a graph-theoretic approach and computational tools to efficiently verify and engineer well-gradedness. The results indicate that the method is effective and provides practical benefits for decision-making processes. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding and application of well-gradedness in union-closed families and provides a useful tool for decision-makers in various fields.
2120	"By making use of the finite-temperature real-time static potential that was introduced and computed to leading non-trivial order in Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory in recent work, and solving numerically a Schr\""odinger-type equation, we estimate the quarkonium (in practice, bottomonium) contribution to the spectral function of the electromagnetic current in hot QCD. The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which becomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450 MeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice reconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'', which generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our results on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on the baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma."
2444	A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm, significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and lower electronic noise.
266	This research paper explores the problem of lattice coarsening effects in Monte Carlo simulations, which can lead to inaccurate results. The authors propose a new method for removing these effects by adjusting the string tension parameter in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group algorithm. Using numerical simulations, they demonstrate that this method effectively eliminates lattice coarsening effects and leads to more accurate results. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for future Monte Carlo simulations in condensed matter physics. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of carefully considering lattice coarsening effects in Monte Carlo simulations and provides a practical solution for addressing this issue.
2937	This paper explores the fluctuations in glassy systems, specifically the effects of temperature and aging on the dynamics of these systems. Using numerical simulations and experiments, the study found that the fluctuations in glassy systems are strongly influenced by temperature and aging, leading to changes in the system's relaxation time and the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity. The results suggest that the behavior of glassy materials is highly complex and cannot be explained solely by their initial structure, but also by their history and the external factors affecting them. Understanding these fluctuations is crucial for developing more accurate models and predicting the behavior of glassy materials in various applications.
2281	This research paper explores the existence and properties of global disk oscillation modes in cataclysmic variables and other Newtonian accretors. The main focus is to understand the behavior and evolution of these oscillation modes in different accretion systems. The study uses numerical simulations to investigate the properties of these oscillation modes and their effects on the accretion process. The crucial finding of this study is the identification of different types of global disk oscillation modes in different accretion systems, and their importance in shaping the accretion flow and the resulting observational features. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of these findings for understanding the physics of accretion and the evolution of cataclysmic variables and other accretion systems.
1455	This research paper examines the prospects for detecting stochastic gravitational waves using the Virgo and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LSC) interferometers. The main objective is to investigate the sensitivity of the interferometers and their potential for detecting a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Through simulations and analysis of data, the paper finds that the combined sensitivity of Virgo and LSC can significantly improve the detection prospects for stochastic gravitational waves.

The conclusion of the study is that with continued improvements in the interferometers and data analysis techniques, the detection of stochastic gravitational waves is an exciting prospect for the future of gravitational wave astronomy.
3514	We obtain a system of exact solutions of the Dirac equation for an electron moving in a constant homogeneous external magnetic field with account of its vacuum magnetic moment and assumed Lorentz invariance violation in the minimal CPT-odd form in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Using these solutions, characteristics of the particle synchrotron radiation are calculated, and possible observable effects caused by the Lorentz non-invariant interaction are described. We demonstrate that the angular distribution of the radiation has specific asymmetry, which can be explained as a consequence of non-conservation of transversal electron polarization in the presence of a background Lorentz non-invariant condensate field.
777	We formulate a general super duality conjecture on connections between parabolic categories O of modules over Lie superalgebras and Lie algebras of type A, based on a Fock space formalism of their Kazhdan-Lusztig theories which was initiated by Brundan. We show that the Brundan-Kazhdan-Lusztig (BKL) polynomials for Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) in our parabolic setup can be identified with the usual parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. We establish some special cases of the BKL conjecture on the parabolic category O of gl(m|n)-modules and additional results which support the BKL conjecture and super duality conjecture.
53	In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered. For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities. It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy efficiency.
1893	This research paper investigates the impact of stellar-mass black holes on the structural evolution of massive star clusters. Using computer simulations, we examine the effects of black hole formation and subsequent interactions on the overall dynamics and morphology of the cluster. Our results show that the presence of black holes can lead to the formation of a central density cusp and an extended halo, as well as the ejection of stars from the cluster. We also find evidence for the formation of binary black holes, which could have significant implications for the production of gravitational waves. Overall, our study sheds light on the complex interplay between black holes and star clusters, and has important implications for our understanding of galactic formation and evolution.
1642	We report a computational first-principles study of positron trapping at vacancy defects in metals and semiconductors. The main emphasis is on the energetics of the trapping process including the interplay between the positron state and the defect's ionic structure and on the ensuing annihilation characteristics of the trapped state. For vacancies in covalent semiconductors the ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling the localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not strongly affect the characteristic features of the electronic structure, e.g., the ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal vacancies the positron-induced ion relaxation has a noticeable effect on the calculated positron lifetime and momentum distribution of annihilating electron-positron pairs.
2693	This research paper investigates the failure of subadditivity of the Wigner-Yanase entropy, which is a measure of quantum uncertainty. The paper presents a mathematical analysis of the entropy and demonstrates that it violates the subadditivity property in certain situations. This finding has significant implications for the use of the Wigner-Yanase entropy as a tool for characterizing quantum systems. The paper concludes that the failure of subadditivity of the entropy should be taken into account when interpreting experimental results and designing new quantum technologies. Overall, this research highlights the importance of carefully examining the properties of quantum entropy measures, and provides valuable insights for the development of future quantum technologies.
1080	The paper focuses on developing an iterative method for computing the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. The sign function is an important mathematical concept in physics and engineering, and it is used in various applications, including the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical potential. The authors of the paper propose a new iterative algorithm based on polynomial approximations to efficiently compute the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to the overlap Dirac operator at nonzero chemical potential and analyzing the results. The paper concludes that the proposed iterative method is a promising approach for efficiently computing the sign function of non-Hermitian matrices in various applications.
1235	We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.
3919	This research paper explores the bursting dynamics of the 3D Euler equations in cylindrical domains. The study investigates the characteristics of the solutions of the equations and their behavior during the bursting phenomenon. The research uses numerical simulations to analyze the development of the bursting and its effects on the solutions. The critical outcomes of the study indicate that the bursting in the cylindrical domains is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that can result in the formation of turbulent structures. The study also highlights the importance of considering the initial conditions and boundary conditions when analyzing the solutions of the 3D Euler equations. The conclusions of the research provide insights into the physical mechanisms that govern the bursting dynamics in cylindrical domains and their implications for various applications in fluid mechanics.
956	We introduce a special class of pairwise-independent self-joinings for a stationary process: Those for which one coordinate is a continuous function of the two others. We investigate which properties on the process the existence of such a joining entails. In particular, we prove that if the process is aperiodic, then it has positive entropy. Our other results suggest that such pairwise independent, non-independent self-joinings exist only in very specific situations: Essentially when the process is a subshift of finite type topologically conjugate to a full-shift. This provides an argument in favor of the conjecture that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold-mixing.
3850	Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed.
D1-18	The question of how many eggs one should eat per day is often debated due to concerns about cholesterol and cardiovascular health. Current research suggests that consuming up to three eggs per day can be part of a healthy diet for most people, particularly young, healthy adults. Consuming up to three eggs per day has been shown to increase HDL (good) cholesterol and improve the LDL/HDL ratio, which are favorable changes for cardiovascular health. For most healthy individuals, consuming up to three eggs per day can be beneficial, improving cholesterol profiles and providing essential nutrients without increasing cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with specific health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should consider their overall dietary patterns.
D2-97	There has been a steady increase in the number of studies investigating educational robotics and its impact on academic and social skills of young learners. Educational robots are used both in and out of school environments to enhance K–12 students’ interest, engagement, and academic achievement in various fields of STEM education. Some prior studies show evidence for the general benefits of educational robotics as being effective in providing impactful learning experiences. However, there appears to be a need to determine the specific benefits which have been achieved through robotics implementation in K–12 formal and informal learning settings. In this study, we present a systematic review of the literature on K–12 educational robotics.
2778	Superconducting and normal-state properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.
2627	SkyMapper is amongst the first of a new generation of dedicated, wide-field survey telescopes. The 1.3m SkyMapper telescope features a 5.7 square degree field-of-view Cassegrain imager and will see first light in late 2007. The primary goal of the facility is to conduct the Southern Sky Survey a six colour, six epoch survey of the southern sky. The survey will provide photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.
3971	This research paper presents a thermodynamic model for the melting of supported metal nanoparticles. The model is based on the classical thermodynamic theory of phase transitions and includes the effects of particle size, shape, and support interaction. The model is used to investigate the melting behavior of gold and nickel nanoparticles supported on different substrates. The results show that the melting temperature of the nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their size and shape, as well as the nature of the substrate. The model provides a useful tool for predicting the melting behavior of metal nanoparticles and can be extended to other supported nanoscale systems.
1810	Since its discovery in the 1930s, the muon has played an important role in our quest to understand the sub-atomic theory of matter. The muon was the first second-generation standard-model particle to be discovered, and its decay has provided information on the (Vector -Axial Vector) structure of the weak interaction, the strength of the weak interaction, G_F, and the conservation of lepton number (flavor) in muon decay. The muon's anomalous magnetic moment has played an important role in restricting theories of physics beyond the standard standard model, where at present there is a 3.4 standard-deviation difference between the experiment and standard-model theory. Its capture on the atomic nucleus has provided valuable information on the modification of the weak current by the strong interaction which is complementary to that obtained from nuclear beta decay.
1941	Yes, there is. - A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of an U(1) symmetry, this kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, where it leads to the Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal nonlinear extension of quantum theory. The probabilistic interpretation, i.e. Born's rule, holds provided the underlying model has only dimensionless parameters.
3962	We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially, this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.
126	"The research paper titled ""Support Vector Machine for Functional Data Classification"" presents a novel approach for classifying functional data. The authors propose the use of support vector machines (SVMs) as a powerful and flexible tool for functional data analysis. The paper provides a detailed description of the SVM algorithm and its application to functional data classification. The authors also compare the performance of SVMs with other classification methods commonly used in functional data analysis. The results show that SVMs outperform other methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. The paper concludes that SVMs are a promising tool for functional data classification and have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications."
2312	The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton states in molecular complexes has been proposed.
1971	The Standard Model of particle physics has been successfully used to predict and explain a wide range of phenomena, but some aspects of it remain untested. This research paper explores the potential for precision measurements of the weak charges of quarks to test the Standard Model. The authors describe the theoretical framework and experimental techniques involved in such measurements, and present results from previous experiments that provide evidence for the Standard Model's predictions. The paper concludes that further precision measurements of weak charges could provide valuable insights into the nature of the Standard Model and help uncover new physics beyond it.
3950	The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the torque.
3334	A complete thermodynamical analysis of the 2+1 dimensional massless Gross-Neveu model is performed using the optimized perturbation theory. This is a non-perturbative method that allows us to go beyond the known large-N results already at lowest order. Our results, for a finite number of fermion species, N, show the existence of a tricritical point in the temperature and chemical potential phase diagram for discrete chiral phase transition allowing us to precisely to locate it. By studying the phase diagram in the pressure and inverse density plane, we also show the existence of a liquid-gas phase, which, so far, was unknown to exist in this model. Finally, we also derive N dependent analytical expressions for the fermionic mass, critical temperature and critical chemical potential.
1047	"The electronic structure of nanowires in contact with metallic electrodes of experimentally relevant sizes is calculated by incorporating the electrostatic polarization potential into the atomistic single particle Schr\""odinger equation. We show that the presence of an electrode produces localized electron/hole states near the electrode, a phenomenon only exhibited in nanostructures and overlooked in the past. This phenomenon will have profound implications on electron transport in such nanosystems. We calculate several electrode/nanowire geometries, with varying contact depths and nanowire radii. We demonstrate the change in the band gap of up to 0.5 eV in 3 nm diameter CdSe nanowires and calculate the magnitude of the applied electric field necessary to overcome the localization."
104	This research paper aims to investigate non-abelian plasma instabilities in the presence of strong anisotropy. The study focuses on the behavior of non-abelian plasmas, which are characterized by a significant deviation from the thermal equilibrium state, and their susceptibility to instabilities under such conditions. The paper highlights the importance of understanding these instabilities in the context of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The theoretical framework used in this research includes a combination of kinetic theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and non-abelian gauge theory. The results show that non-abelian plasma instabilities can arise due to the anisotropy of the plasma, leading to the generation of coherent structures and turbulence. The study provides new insights into the behavior of non-abelian plasmas and highlights the need for further research in this area.
371	This research paper explores the properties of optically thick radio cores in narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. The study used observational data from the Very Large Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to analyze the spectral energy distributions of these nebulae. The authors found that the radio emission in these objects is likely dominated by synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles. Additionally, the study suggests that these nebulae may be undergoing episodic mass-loss events, which could be responsible for their unique shape. Overall, this research provides important insights into the physical and dynamical processes at work in narrow-waist bipolar nebulae.
790	The research paper focuses on studying the behavior of inertial particles in turbulent flows. Specifically, the authors examine the Lyapunov exponents, which are used to quantify how fast nearby trajectories in the flow diverge or converge. They derive a fluctuation relation for these exponents, which relates the probability of observing a certain value of the exponent to the probability of observing the opposite value. They also propose a pairing rule for the exponents, which predicts that they should occur in pairs with opposite signs. The authors use numerical simulations to validate their theoretical predictions and find that the fluctuation relation and pairing rule hold for a wide range of particle sizes and flow parameters. These findings provide insights into the statistical properties of turbulent flows and have implications for understanding the dynamics of particle transport in such flows.
3431	The Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in order to impose incompressibility. Regularity of the solutions is ensured in several ways: First, the potentials are represented using a spectral basis which is analytic at the cylindrical axis. Second, the non-physical discontinuous boundary conditions at the cylindrical corners are smoothed using a polynomial approximation to a steep exponential profile. Third, the nonlinear term is evaluated in such a way as to eliminate singularities. The resulting pseudo-spectral code is tested using exact polynomial solutions and the spectral convergence of the coefficients is demonstrated. Our solutions are shown to agree with exact polynomial solutions and with previous axisymmetric calculations of vortex breakdown and of nonaxisymmetric calculations of onset of helical spirals. Parallelization by azimuthal wavenumber is shown to be highly effective.
3457	We establish a one-to-one correspondence between one-sided and two-sided regular systems of conditional probabilities on the half-line that preserves the associated chains and Gibbs measures. As an application, we determine uniqueness and non-uniqueness regimes in one-sided versions of ferromagnetic Ising models with long range interactions. Our study shows that the interplay between chain and Gibbsian theories yields more information than that contained within the known theory of each separate framework. In particular: (i) A Gibbsian construction due to Dyson yields a new family of chains with phase transitions; (ii) these transitions show that a square summability uniqueness condition of chains is false in the general non-shift-invariant setting, and (iii) an uniqueness criterion for chains shows that a Gibbsian conjecture due to Kac and Thompson is false in this half-line setting.
3345	The conformational behavior of a giant DNA mediated by condensing agents in the bulk solution has been investigated through experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, a pronounced conformational hysteresis is observed for folding and unfolding processes, by increasing and decreasing the concentration of condensing agent PEG (Polyethylene glycol), respectively. To elucidate the observed hysteresis, a semiflexible chain model is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations for the coil-globule transition. In the simulations, the hysteresis loop emerges for stiff enough chains, indicating distinct pathways for folding and unfolding processes. Also, our results show that globular state is thermodynamically more stable than coiled state in the hysteresis loop. Our findings suggest that increasing chain stiffness may reduce the chain conformations relevant to the folding pathway, which impedes the folding process.
3959	This research paper investigates the impact of environmental noise on the performance of holonomic quantum gates and proposes a method for reducing noise to improve gate fidelity. The study utilized numerical simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different noise reduction techniques, including dynamical decoupling and optimal control. The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the impact of noise on holonomic gates, leading to improved gate performance and increased robustness against environmental disturbances. The study concludes that noise reduction is essential for achieving high-fidelity holonomic gates, which are critical for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
846	"The research paper titled ""Smectic elastomer membranes"" investigates the properties of smectic elastomers, which are materials that exhibit both liquid crystal and rubber-like behavior. The main theme of the paper is to understand the deformation behavior of smectic elastomer membranes under external stimuli such as mechanical stress and temperature changes. The researchers conducted a series of experiments and simulations to analyze the smectic elastomer membranes' response to these stimuli. They found that the smectic elastomer membranes exhibit unique deformation behavior, characterized by the formation of wrinkles and folds, as well as changes in their smectic order. The paper concludes that smectic elastomer membranes have potential applications in various fields, including soft robotics and biomedical devices, due to their tunable mechanical properties and responsiveness to external stimuli."
4011	We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.
2140	"The research paper titled ""Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588"" focuses on the detection of a high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588. The primary focus of the study is to investigate the properties of the oscillation and its origin. Using data obtained from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, the authors were able to confirm the presence of the oscillation and track its evolution over time. The study provides valuable insights into the physical properties of ultra-compact X-ray binaries and the behavior of the high-frequency oscillations detected in these systems. The outcomes of the study suggest that the observed oscillation is likely due to the accretion process in the binary system."
760	This research paper explores the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in neutron stars and black holes, which provide insight into the dense matter and strong gravitational fields present in these objects. The authors discuss the theoretical models and observational evidence for QPOs in both types of objects and highlight the similarities and differences between them. They also explore the potential implications of QPOs for our understanding of fundamental physics and the properties of neutron stars and black holes. The paper concludes that QPOs offer a powerful tool for probing the physics of compact objects and that further observations and theoretical developments are necessary to fully understand these fascinating phenomena.
58	"The research paper titled ""Symmetry Relations for Trajectories of a Brownian Motor"" explores the properties of a Brownian motor, which is a device that can convert thermal energy into mechanical work. The authors investigate the symmetry properties of the motor's trajectory using mathematical models and simulations. The main finding of the study is that the motor's trajectory exhibits a remarkable symmetry, which is related to the underlying symmetries of the motor's structure. The authors also show that this symmetry can be broken by external perturbations, which can lead to changes in the motor's efficiency. Overall, the study provides new insights into the fundamental properties of Brownian motors and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics."
2545	A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization.

D1-17	The recommended number of eggs to consume per week varies depending on several factors, including individual health, dietary preferences, and overall dietary patterns. It's important to note that while eggs are a nutritious food, they are also relatively high in dietary cholesterol. According to general guidelines, including those provided by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, consuming up to seven eggs per week is considered reasonable and can be part of a healthy diet for most people. However, it's important to consider the overall context of your diet, including other sources of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as your individual health goals and any specific dietary restrictions or considerations you may have.
3167	The paper explores the concept of reference frames in special and general relativity, specifically in the context of freely falling frames. The authors argue that gravitational energy can be properly defined only in a freely falling frame, and not in an arbitrary reference frame. They also show that the energy-momentum tensor for a gravitational field in a freely falling frame can be derived from the stress-energy tensor of matter, and that this result has important implications for the interpretation of gravitational waves. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of understanding the role of reference frames in the study of gravity and spacetime.
2147	The Lifshitz-type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the van der Waals interaction between an atom (molecule) and a single-wall carbon nanotube are obtained. The single-wall nanotube is considered as a cylindrical sheet carrying a two-dimensional free electron gas with appropriate boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field. The obtained formulas are used to calculate the van der Waals free energy and force between a hydrogen atom (molecule) and single-wall carbon nanotubes of different radia. Comparison studies of the van der Waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom-nanotube separation distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls.
3975	This research paper focuses on the study of locating the peaks of least-energy solutions to a quasilinear elliptic Neumann problem. The main objective is to investigate the behavior of the least-energy solutions and their peaks in relation to the nonlinearity of the problem. The paper presents several key findings, including the existence of a critical exponent that determines the behavior of the peaks, and the fact that the location of the peaks is dependent on the geometry of the domain. The paper also discusses the implications of these findings and their significance for further research in the field. Overall, the research suggests that a deeper understanding of the behavior of the least-energy solutions to quasilinear elliptic Neumann problems is necessary for the development of more robust and accurate mathematical models.
908	"It is a common assumption that quantum systems with time reversal invariance and classically chaotic dynamics have energy spectra distributed according to GOE-type of statistics. Here we present a class of systems which fail to follow this rule. We show that for convex billiards of constant width with time reversal symmetry and ""almost"" chaotic dynamics the energy level distribution is of GUE-type. The effect is due to the lack of ergodicity in the ""momentum"" part of the phase space and, as we argue, is generic in two dimensions. Besides, we show that certain billiards of constant width in multiply connected domains are of interest in relation to the quantum ergodicity problem. These billiards are quantum ergodic, but not classically ergodic."

Using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how the size of the eigenstates affects the formation and properties of resonances. Our results show that the extent of the eigenstates plays a crucial role in determining the resonance frequencies and widths, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for weak coupling strengths. We discuss the implications of our findings for various physical systems, including atoms, molecules, and solid-state devices, and suggest possible avenues for future experimental and theoretical research. Overall, this study sheds new light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying resonance phenomena and provides important insights into the design and optimization of resonant devices and systems.
2021	Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and second row of the periodic table is obtained.
3348	This research paper focuses on the comparison of the radio luminosities of solitary and binary millisecond pulsars, with a specific focus on PSR J1453+1902. The study found that binary pulsars have higher radio luminosities than solitary pulsars, which may be attributed to the interaction between the pulsar and its companion star. Additionally, the analysis of PSR J1453+1902 revealed that it has a relatively low radio luminosity compared to other binary pulsars, suggesting that it may have a unique evolutionary history. Overall, the study sheds light on the relationship between pulsar evolution and radio luminosity, and provides insights into the properties of PSR J1453+1902.

1887	This research paper presents an investigation of the Larkin-Imry-Ma (LIM) state in 3He-A confined in aerogel. The LIM state is a unique phase of matter that arises due to the interplay between superfluidity and disorder. Through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and ultrasound measurements, the authors explore the effects of aerogel on the LIM state and observe a reduction in the critical velocity for the onset of turbulence. This suggests that the presence of aerogel enhances the effects of disorder and weakens the superfluidity of 3He-A. These findings have implications for the understanding of superfluidity in disordered systems and may have practical applications in the design of new materials for quantum computing and other technologies.

1496	We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, (GTW-WT), and the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, (BATW-WT). It is shown that the two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel (GMAC-WT) to illustrate this advantage.

The study concludes that a hybrid mobility model can provide significant benefits for mobile ad-hoc network design and performance optimization.
D1-27	"We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models ""sunspot activity – temperature""."
3575	The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space. The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link several solutions to the direct kinematic problem without meeting a singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. Additional surfaces are characterized in the workspace which yield new uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator.

Insects offer a wide variety of flavors and are commonly consumed whole or pulverized for use in dishes and processed food products such as burger patties, pasta, or snacks. Like other foods, there can be risks associated with consuming insects, such as allergic reactions.

2082	We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive measure of azimuth structure.
2905	We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.
749	Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD, such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent. While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust for hundreds of qubits.
3505	This research paper investigates the demixing and orientational ordering of mixtures of rectangular particles. The main objectives of this study are to understand the effect of particle shape and size on demixing and to explore the emergence of orientational order in the system. The research findings demonstrate that particle shape and size play a critical role in the demixing process, with larger particles exhibiting stronger demixing tendencies. Additionally, the study reveals that orientational ordering in the system is influenced by the presence of both size and shape asymmetry. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental physics of particle mixtures and has potential implications for the design of functional materials.
3970	We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.
1238	This research paper investigates the mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the quasi-periodic modulations that occur in radio supernovae. LBVs are massive stars that undergo sporadic eruptions, and the resulting mass loss can contribute to the formation of supernovae. The study uses radio observations of supernovae to explore the relationship between LBV mass loss and the modulation of radio emission from supernovae. The findings suggest that LBV mass loss can lead to quasi-periodic modulations in the radio emission from supernovae, providing insight into the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena. The research concludes that further studies of LBV mass loss and its effects on supernovae are necessary to fully understand the processes that lead to these events.
3723	We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
1116	An eleven channel digital asynchronous transceiver (DAT) employing parallel optical link technology has been developed for trigger signal distribution across the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Combinatorial logic functions are implemented in Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGAs, providing a versatile solution adaptable for use in future atmospheric Cerenkov detectors and other high-energy astroparticle experiments. The device is dead-time free and introduces a minimal skew of 1.6 ns between channels.

2480	"The research paper titled ""Aspects of Stochastic Resonance in Reaction-Diffusion Systems: The Nonequilibrium-Potential Approach"" investigates the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems. The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the nonequilibrium-potential approach, which allows for the examination of the role of noise in the system's behavior. They demonstrate that the presence of noise can enhance the system's response to external signals, leading to stochastic resonance. The study also explores the effects of different parameters, such as the system's size and the strength of the noise, on the occurrence and strength of stochastic resonance. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of how noise influences the behavior of complex systems and have implications for fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology."

The study focuses on the behavior of quarkonia states in the QCD plasma, which is considered to be a significant probe of the plasma properties. The paper presents a theoretical framework that utilizes QCD sum rules to calculate the mass shift and width broadening of J/psi in the hot gluonic plasma. The results indicate that the mass shift and width broadening are highly dependent on the temperature and the density of the plasma. The study provides valuable insights into the properties of QCD plasma and its interaction with quarkonia states, which can help in understanding the dynamics of high-energy collisions and the formation of quark-gluon plasma.
2936	We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems. We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal. We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to present.
3155	The separability criterion for multipartite pure states is an important problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a multipartite pure state can be written as a tensor product of individual states. We present a new separability criterion based on the concept of Schmidt rank and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for separability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our criterion by applying it to a number of examples of multipartite pure states. Our results provide a useful tool for analyzing the entanglement properties of multipartite pure states and have potential applications in quantum information processing.

3669	This research paper aims to investigate the application of nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods. Lattice Boltzmann methods are widely used for simulating fluid dynamics in complex geometries. However, these methods can lead to unphysical results due to the violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Nonequilibrium entropy limiters are one approach to address this issue by introducing a constraint on the entropy production rate. This paper will explore the impact of entropy limiters on the accuracy and stability of lattice Boltzmann simulations. The study will involve numerical simulations of various flow configurations and comparison with experimental data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of more reliable and accurate lattice Boltzmann methods for fluid dynamics simulations.
1505	This research paper aims to provide a possible explanation as to why the Theta+ baryon has been observed in some experiments and not in others. The Theta+ is a short-lived particle that has been the subject of much interest in the field of particle physics. While some experiments have reported the observation of the Theta+, others have failed to detect it. This paper proposes that the different results may be due to the different experimental conditions used in each study, such as the energy of the particles used to produce the Theta+ and the detection methods employed. The paper also discusses the potential implications of these findings for our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter. Finally, the paper concludes by suggesting avenues for future research on the Theta+ and other particles in the field of particle physics.
65	This research paper presents a mid-infrared laser light nulling experiment using single-mode conductive waveguides. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of nulling laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths using waveguides. The experiment was conducted using a CO2 laser and a single-mode conductive waveguide made of silicon. The results of the experiment show that the waveguide successfully nulls the laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths. The study concludes that single-mode conductive waveguides can be an effective approach for nulling laser light at mid-infrared wavelengths, which has important implications for applications in astronomy and remote sensing.
1884	In this paper, we report on the magnetic properties of Ba2CoS3, a spin-chain compound recently found to be the first Co2+ containing one-dimensional sulphide to show metallic-like conductivity and negative magnetoresistance. We carried out an in-depth experimental investigation of the local structure of the cobalt atoms, and ab-initio calculations of the resulting electronic configuration of Co2+. From theoretical considerations, the intra-chain coupling was predicted to be antiferromagnetic. Experimentally, several estimates of this magnetic coupling were derived by analysing the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements also provided evidence of a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering, a feature indicative of a noticeable inter-chain coupling in this quasi-1D system.
2416	Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient approximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the migration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent experimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface microstructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic coarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these microstructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving force, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for coarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain boundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an intrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline metals.
1558	This research paper investigates the spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations of the brightest cluster and group galaxies. The main objective is to understand the formation and evolution of these galaxies in the context of their surrounding environments. The study utilizes integral field spectroscopy and imaging data from the MaNGA survey to analyze the kinematics and stellar populations of these galaxies. The key findings include the identification of two distinct populations of brightest cluster galaxies with different kinematic properties and stellar populations. Additionally, the study finds evidence for recent star formation in some of the brightest group galaxies, suggesting that these galaxies are still actively evolving. Overall, the research highlights the importance of considering the environment when studying the formation and evolution of brightest cluster and group galaxies.
3390	There is accumulating evidence in lattice QCD that attempts to locate confining fields in vacuum configurations bring results explicitly depending on tha lattice spacing (that is, ultraviolet cut off). Generically, one deals with low-dimensional vacuum defects which occupy a vanishing fraction of the total four-dimensional space. We review briefly existing data on the vacuum defects and their significance for confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena. We introduce the notion of `quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy, rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were triggered by creation of the Sakata model.
1708	In this paper we derive some new and practical results on testing and interval estimation problems for the population eigenvalues of a Wishart matrix based on the asymptotic theory for block-wise infinite dispersion of the population eigenvalues. This new type of asymptotic theory has been developed by the present authors in Takemura and Sheena (2005) and Sheena and Takemura (2007a,b) and in these papers it was applied to point estimation problem of population covariance matrix in a decision theoretic framework. In this paper we apply it to some testing and interval estimation problems. We show that the approximation based on this type of asymptotics is generally much better than the traditional large-sample asymptotics for the problems.
1787	This research paper presents the results of an experimental study on the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) film thickness in a rolling-sliding contact. The main objective of the study was to validate the analytical predictions of EHL film thickness using a novel experimental setup. The experiments were conducted on a ball-on-disc tribometer, and the film thickness was measured using a capacitance sensor. The results showed good agreement between the experimental and analytical results for a range of operating conditions. The study also showed that the EHL film thickness depends strongly on the viscosity-pressure coefficient and the elastic deformation of the surfaces, and these parameters should be carefully considered in the design of lubricated contacts. The findings of this study have important implications for the design and optimization of tribological systems, particularly in high load and high-speed applications.
49	In this paper, pilot-assisted transmission over Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading channels is considered. A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is transmitted every T symbols and T-1 data symbols are transmitted in between the pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are optimized by maximizing this lower bound.
3702	This research paper investigates the coincidence of oscillations in the dipole transition and persistent current of narrow quantum rings that contain two electrons. By studying the dependence of the dipole transition and persistent current on the external magnetic field and the width of the ring, we show that the two oscillations occur simultaneously. We find that the frequency of the oscillations increases with the magnetic field, but the amplitude decreases with increasing ring width. Our results provide insight into the intricate interplay between the dipole transition and persistent current in narrow quantum rings, which could have implications for the design of future electronic devices.
3588	Special solutions of string theory in supercritical dimensions can interpolate in time between theories with different numbers of spacetime dimensions (via dimension quenching) and different amounts of worldsheet supersymmetry (via c-duality). These solutions connect supercritical string theories to the more familiar string duality web in ten dimensions, and provide a precise link between supersymmetric and purely bosonic string theories. Dimension quenching and c-duality appear to be natural concepts in string theory, giving rise to large networks of interconnected theories. We describe some of these networks in detail and discuss general consistency constraints on the types of transitions that arise in this framework.
824	"The research paper titled ""Rigidity-dependent cosmic ray energy spectra in the knee region obtained with the GAMMA experiment"" presents the findings and conclusions of a study on cosmic ray energy spectra in the knee region. The study was conducted using the GAMMA experiment, which measured cosmic ray particles' energy and rigidity. The results showed that the rigidity-dependent spectral features of cosmic rays changed significantly in the knee region, which is a critical energy range for understanding the origin and acceleration of cosmic rays. The study's findings suggest that a combination of different cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms may be responsible for the observed spectral features. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the origin and acceleration of cosmic rays and highlights the importance of studying their rigidity-dependent spectral features in the knee region."
2306	Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.
2563	This research paper focuses on the study of radio and X-ray nebulae associated with PSR J1509-5850, a pulsar located in the southern sky. The main objective of the study is to understand the nature and properties of these nebulae and their relationship with the pulsar. The researchers used multi-wavelength observations from several telescopes to analyze the emission properties of the nebulae and their spatial distribution. The study revealed that the radio and X-ray nebulae have different morphologies and are likely to be produced by different emission mechanisms. The researchers also found evidence of a compact X-ray source near the pulsar, which suggests the presence of a neutron star or a black hole companion. The study provides important insights into the physics of pulsar wind nebulae and their association with pulsars.
3354	The ability to bluff is a crucial aspect of human social interaction, and yet little is known about how individuals learn to bluff effectively. This research paper investigates the process of learning to bluff by conducting a series of experiments using a computer game that simulates a strategic bluffing scenario. Participants were given the opportunity to learn and improve their bluffing skills over multiple rounds of play. Results indicate that individuals can learn to bluff more effectively over time and that this skill can be improved through feedback and practice. This research has important implications for understanding social cognition and improving interpersonal communication skills. By better understanding the process of learning to bluff, individuals may be able to improve their ability to navigate complex social situations and improve their overall social competence.
D2-58	The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded in a process called inflation. As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental particles and then atoms formed, eventually leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (leftover heat from the early universe) and the abundance of light elements, strongly supports this theory. The Big Bang also explains the universe's large-scale structure and the observed redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates the ongoing expansion of space.
2990	We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models, which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples underline the results.
2985	The paper investigates the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies in the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory. MOND is an alternative to dark matter that proposes a modification to gravity on galactic scales. The study uses numerical simulations to analyze the vertical structure of disk galaxies in MOND. The results show that the vertical velocity dispersion of stars increases with radius, which is consistent with observations. The study also finds that MOND produces more pronounced flaring of the disk than the classical Newtonian dynamics. The authors conclude that MOND provides a good description of the vertical dynamics of disk galaxies and is a viable alternative to dark matter.
985	"The research paper titled ""Lifetime Improvement in Wireless Sensor Networks via Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission"" investigates the use of collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission for improving the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. The main theme of the paper revolves around the idea of utilizing the limited energy resources of sensor nodes efficiently to prolong network lifetime. The study proposes a cooperative beamforming scheme that enables multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously, reducing power consumption and increasing the overall network lifetime. The paper presents noteworthy results that demonstrate a significant improvement in network lifetime and energy efficiency when using the proposed cooperative beamforming scheme. The study concludes that collaborative beamforming and cooperative transmission can be effective techniques for improving the performance of wireless sensor networks."
3572	The objective of this research paper is to study the uniqueness domains of parallel manipulators in their workspace. The paper first defines the concept of uniqueness domains and presents a method to compute them for different types of parallel manipulators. The study then investigates the impact of design parameters, such as link lengths and joint angles, on the size and shape of the uniqueness domains. Key results indicate that the size and shape of the uniqueness domains vary significantly with changes in the design parameters. The paper also highlights the importance of uniqueness domains in the design and control of parallel manipulators. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of parallel manipulators and can aid in the optimization of their design for specific applications.
2325	We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational mode.
D2-42	In order to determine how much Vitamin D supplement to take, you first need to find out what your current Vitamin D level is. You determine the level of vitamin D by doing a blood test for 25 (OH) vitamin D. That’s 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Most experts agree that a level of 32 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) in the blood is optimal for bone health but no one agrees on what is optimal for immune health, heart health, cancer health and all the other important functions that vitamin D appears to have. Your skin, where vitamin D is made, has a wonderful system for making the right amount, then shutting off further production.
48	The low-snr capacity of M-ary PSK transmission over both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero snr are obtained. The spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.
594	This Letter reports on the detection of two super-Earth planets in the Gl581 system, already known to harbour a hot Neptune. One of the planets has a mass of 5 M_Earth and resides at the ``warm'' edge of the habitable zone of the star. It is thus the known exoplanet which most resembles our own Earth. The other planet has a 7.7 M_Earth mass and orbits at 0.25 AU from the star, close to the ``cold'' edge of the habitable zone. These two new light planets around an M3 dwarf further confirm the formerly tentative statistical trend for i) many more very low-mass planets being found around M dwarfs than around solar-type stars and ii) low-mass planets outnumbering Jovian planets around M dwarfs.
3923	This research paper proposes a novel model for cascading failures in complex networks that balances high robustness with low cost. The model is based on analyzing the structural properties of the network and identifying key nodes that play a crucial role in maintaining network connectivity. By strategically reinforcing these critical nodes, the model is able to significantly improve the network's ability to withstand failures and prevent cascading effects, while minimizing the associated costs. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through extensive simulations on various types of networks, including power grids, transportation systems, and social networks. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in terms of both robustness and cost-effectiveness, making it a promising solution for improving the resilience of complex networks in practical applications.
173	The discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation. In contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models, in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization, together with a fine-tuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations, render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur. The energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations.
3831	A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.
2263	This research paper investigates the electromagnetic Casimir densities for a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical shell. The main objective of this study is to explore the influence of the cylindrical shell on the Casimir densities in the wedge. The research employs numerical computations to compute the Casimir densities in the configuration of the wedge with the cylindrical shell. The results of the study show that the cylindrical shell significantly affects the Casimir densities in the wedge. The study also reveals that the Casimir densities are highly sensitive to the distance between the wedge and the cylindrical shell. The findings of this research paper provide useful insights into the understanding of the Casimir effect in complex geometries and can have important implications for the design of nanoscale devices.
3531	This research paper investigates the dynamics of soliton-fermion systems and their interaction with stabilised vortex loops. We employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods to study the behaviour of these systems under various conditions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of fermions can significantly affect the stability and lifetime of vortex loops. Furthermore, we find that the interaction between solitons and fermions can lead to the formation of complex structures such as vortex rings and soliton-fermion composites. Additionally, we show that the energy transfer between solitons and fermions can have important implications for the behaviour of the system. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the physics of soliton-fermion systems and their interaction with vortex loops, with potential applications in fields such as condensed matter physics and cosmology.
D1-9	Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery. In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.
2013	The Fixed Phase Quantum Search Algorithm (FPQSA) is a novel approach to the well-known Grover's search algorithm. In this paper, we present the concept of FPQSA and demonstrate its potential advantages over the standard Grover's algorithm. We show that the FPQSA can achieve a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms, and can be implemented with a fixed phase that is independent of the number of search items. We provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in various scenarios, including the case of multiple marked items, and compare it with other quantum search algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the FPQSA has the potential to be a useful and efficient tool in quantum information processing and quantum computing applications.
3621	This research paper focuses on the use of satellite observations to study the geometry of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection and the separator lines that form during the process. The study uses data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to analyze the formation and evolution of the separator lines in the Earth's magnetosphere. The results show that the separator lines are complex and highly dynamic structures that play a critical role in the energy transfer during magnetic reconnection. The findings have important implications for our understanding of space weather and the dynamics of magnetic fields in the universe. Ultimately, this research advances our knowledge of the fundamental physics behind magnetic reconnection and contributes to the development of more accurate models and predictions of space weather phenomena.
2113	"The research paper titled ""A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Logic: Extended Version"" presents a new sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic that is cut-free, meaning that it does not involve the elimination of intermediate formulas. The authors introduce a sequent calculus that is sound and complete, and they show that it has a normal form that is unique up to permutation of the premises. They also prove the cut-elimination theorem for the calculus and provide an algorithm for cut-elimination. Finally, the paper presents a number of examples and applications of the calculus. Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the development of sequent calculi for bi-intuitionistic logic and lays the groundwork for further research in this area."
708	"The research paper titled ""Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward"" presents an analysis of the diversity performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multihop relay channels using the amplify-and-forward (AF) technique. The paper evaluates the impact of different relay paths and antenna configurations on the diversity gain achieved by the system. The results show that increasing the number of relay nodes and antennas can significantly improve the diversity gain, while the choice of relay path also plays a crucial role. The paper concludes that careful optimization of the relay node locations and antenna configurations can lead to improved diversity performance in MIMO AF multihop relay channels."
284	The mechanism of carbon nanotube (CNT) nucleation and growth has been a mystery for over 15 years. Prior models have attempted the extension of older classical transport mechanisms. In July 2000, a more detailed and accurate nonclassical, relativistic mechanism was formulated considering the detailed dynamics of the electronics of spin and orbital rehybridization between the carbon and catalyst via novel mesoscopic phenomena and quantum dynamics. Ferromagnetic carbon was demonstrated. Here, quantum (Hall) effects and relativistic effects of intense many body spin-orbital interactions for novel orbital rehybridization dynamics (Little Effect) are proposed in this new dynamical magnetic mechanism. This dynamic ferromagnetic mechanism is proven by imposing dynamic and static magnetic fields during CNT syntheses and observing the different influence of these external magnetic environments on the catalyzing spin currents and spin waves and the resulting CNT formation.
2735	This research paper focuses on the study of top flavor violation (TFV) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using B factories. The primary objective is to decipher the mechanism of TFV and its impact on particle physics. The study involves a comprehensive analysis of experimental data from LHC and B factories to identify the most probable mechanisms responsible for TFV. The research findings reveal that TFV is a rare phenomenon, but its detection can provide crucial insights into the nature of fundamental particles and their interactions. The study concludes that the use of B factories can enhance the precision of TFV measurements and contribute to the development of new theoretical models in particle physics.
1753	This research paper investigates the quantum pump effect in one-dimensional systems of Dirac fermions. The quantum pump effect is a phenomenon that occurs in systems with time-dependent potentials, where a net charge current is generated without the application of an external bias voltage. The authors use a tight-binding model to study the pump effect in a one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon, finding that the pump effect is robust against disorder and can be tuned by adjusting the system parameters. They also show that the pump effect is sensitive to the Fermi energy and the frequency of the driving potential. The paper concludes that the one-dimensional Dirac fermion system is a promising platform for studying the quantum pump effect and its potential applications in nanoelectronics.
3494	The main result of this paper is a quasi-hamiltonian analogue of a special case of the O'Shea-Sjamaar convexity theorem for usual momentum maps. We denote by U a simply connected compact connected Lie group and we fix an involutive automorphism of maximal rank on this Lie group (such an automorphism always exists). We then denote by M a quasi-hamiltonian U-space and we prove that the image under the momentum map of the fixed-point set of a form-reversing compatible involution of M is a convex polytope, which is in fact equal to the full momentum polytope. This theorem was announced in arXiv:math/0609517v1. As an application, we obtain an example of lagrangian subspace in representation spaces of surface groups.
1715	"The research paper titled ""ALMA: Fourier phase analysis made possible"" discusses the implementation of a new method to measure the Fourier phase of interferometric data obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The method uses a statistical approach to estimate the phase errors and correct them, resulting in high-quality images with improved resolution and sensitivity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying it to various ALMA datasets, including observations of nearby galaxies and protoplanetary disks. The study concludes that the Fourier phase analysis method is a valuable tool for improving the quality of interferometric data and enhancing our understanding of the underlying astrophysical processes."
3307	We investigate the possibility to localize scalar field configurations as a model for black hole accretion. We analyze and resolve difficulties encountered when localizing scalar fields in General Relativity. We illustrate this ability with a simple spherically symmetric model which can be used to study features of accreting shells around a black hole. This is accomplished by prescribing a scalar field with a coordinate dependent potential. Numerical solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations are shown, where a scalar filed is indeed confined within a region surrounding a black hole. The resulting spacetime can be described in terms of simple harmonic time dependence.
3819	The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.
1077	We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived a graded refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the light deflection in a gravitational field can be calculated correctly with the use of this refractive index and therefore the gravitational lensing can be treated conveniently with the optical method. For illustration, we simulated the imaging of gravitational lensing, figured out the time delay between the two images and calculated the lens mass in a conventional optical way.
473	"In order to obtain more comprehensive information about an celestial object, the radio image must be identified with the optical one. Many years the identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria, which leads to abundant misidentifications and ""empty field"" in optics for the radio sources. For this reason significant part of radio sources do not have identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of radio sources if compared with the optical one. By taking into account the radio refraction, the major number of the radio sources can be successfully identified with the optical objects."
3445	"We show the asymptotic long-time equivalence of a generic power law waiting time distribution to the Mittag-Leffler waiting time distribution, characteristic for a time fractional CTRW. This asymptotic equivalence is effected by a combination of ""rescaling"" time and ""respeeding"" the relevant renewal process followed by a passage to a limit for which we need a suitable relation between the parameters of rescaling and respeeding. Turning our attention to spatially 1-D CTRWs with a generic power law jump distribution, ""rescaling"" space can be interpreted as a second kind of ""respeeding"" which then, again under a proper relation between the relevant parameters leads in the limit to the space-time fractional diffusion equation. Finally, we treat the `time fractional drift"" process as a properly scaled limit of the counting number of a Mittag-Leffler renewal process."
296	The paper presents a theoretical study of the Rashba model, which describes the spin-orbit coupling in semiconductor structures. The authors derive coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion equations that describe the dynamics of spin and charge transport in the presence of the Rashba effect. The equations are solved numerically, and the results show that the Rashba effect can significantly affect the spin and charge transport properties. In particular, the spin Hall effect is enhanced by the Rashba coupling, and the spin and charge currents can exhibit nontrivial spatial profiles. The study provides insights into the interplay between spin and charge transport in semiconductor structures and highlights the importance of including the Rashba effect in the analysis of spintronic devices.
2723	This research paper aims to investigate the generation of entanglement outside of the light cone, which refers to a phenomenon where two quantum particles share a state despite being separated by a distance that is too great for any signal to travel between them. The study explores the possibility of creating such entanglement and examines its potential applications in quantum communication and computation. The research findings indicate that entanglement outside of the light cone can be generated through certain physical processes, and its properties have been characterized and analyzed. The paper concludes that this phenomenon has significant implications for the development of future quantum technologies and provides a promising avenue for exploring the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
2977	This research paper revisits the issues surrounding NetFlow sample and export performance, a critical area for network monitoring and security. The study evaluates the performance of NetFlow sampling and export mechanisms, and the impact of different sampling rates on the accuracy of flow data. The research findings indicate that increasing the sampling rate can improve the accuracy of flow data, but at the cost of increased resource consumption. The paper also proposes a new method for optimizing NetFlow sampling based on flow characteristics. The results of this study have significant implications for network administrators and security professionals who rely on NetFlow data for network monitoring and analysis.
47	"The research paper titled ""An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels"" focuses on the tradeoff between energy efficiency and channel estimation accuracy in wireless communication systems. The paper proposes a new training method that optimizes the energy efficiency of channel estimation while maintaining a satisfactory level of accuracy.The key findings of the research are that traditional training methods consume a significant amount of energy and do not necessarily result in the highest accuracy. The proposed method reduces energy consumption by adjusting the number of pilot symbols transmitted, while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy.The paper concludes that the proposed method can significantly improve the energy efficiency of wireless communication systems, especially in scenarios where energy is a limiting factor. It also highlights the importance of considering energy efficiency in the design of wireless communication systems."
755	We present a numerical study of a quantum phase transition from a spin-polarized to a topologically ordered phase in a system of spin-1/2 particles on a torus. We demonstrate that this non-symmetry-breaking topological quantum phase transition (TOQPT) is of second order. The transition is analyzed via the ground state energy and fidelity, block entanglement, Wilson loops, and the recently proposed topological entropy. Only the topological entropy distinguishes the TOQPT from a standard QPT, and remarkably, does so already for small system sizes. Thus the topological entropy serves as a proper order parameter. We demonstrate that our conclusions are robust under the addition of random perturbations, not only in the topological phase, but also in the spin polarized phase and even at the critical point.
1122	This research paper explores the potential of using quantum simulations in ion traps to simulate the early expanding universe. The paper begins by introducing the concept of ion traps and their use in quantum simulations. It then delves into the current understanding of the early expanding universe and the challenges faced in simulating it. The paper discusses various theoretical models that have been proposed for simulating the early universe and evaluates the feasibility of implementing them in ion traps. Finally, the paper presents the potential benefits and limitations of using quantum simulations in ion traps to study the early universe and discusses future directions for research in this area.
4006	This research paper explores the possibility of geometrically engineering the Standard Model by locally unfolding three families out of the exceptional Lie group E8. We propose a novel approach to constructing the Standard Model using geometric structures derived from E8, which allows for the unification of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. Our method involves the identification and manipulation of specific substructures within E8, leading to the emergence of a three-family fermion spectrum. We investigate the implications of this approach, including potential experimental signatures, and discuss its relevance to ongoing efforts in theoretical physics. Overall, our work suggests that geometric engineering may provide a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.
3807	We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).
917	A novel strongly nonlinear laminar metamaterial supporting new types of solitary and shock waves with impact energy mitigating capabilities is presented. It consists of steel plates with intermittent polymer toroidal rings acting as strongly nonlinear springs with large allowable strain. Their force-displacement relationship is described by the addition of two power-law relationships resulting in a solitary wave speed and width depending on the amplitude. This double nonlinearity allows splitting of an initial impulse into two separate strongly nonlinear solitary wave trains. Solitary and shock waves are observed experimentally and analyzed numerically in an assembly with Teflon o-rings.
1814	The spectrum of large radius exciton in an individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is described within the framework of elementary potential model, in which exciton is modeled as bound state of two oppositely charged quasi-particles confined on the tube surface. Due to the parity of the interaction potential the exciton states split into the odd and even series. It is shown that for the bare and screened Coulomb electron-hole (e-h) potentials the binding energy of even excitons in the ground state well exceeds the energy gap. The factors preventing the collapse of single-electron states in isolated semiconducting SWCNTs are discussed.
776	This research paper investigates the properties of horizon-penetrating transonic accretion disks around rotating black holes. The main objective is to understand the impact of black hole spin on the structure and dynamics of the accretion disk. To achieve this, we perform numerical simulations using a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. Our results show that the black hole spin affects the size and shape of the accretion disk, as well as the accretion rate and the energy output. We find that the presence of a rotating black hole can generate strong jets and outflows, which can have important astrophysical implications. Our study provides new insights into the physics of accretion disks and their interaction with black holes, with potential applications to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries.
3647	Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
2383	This research paper aims to study the structural parameters of globular clusters in M31 and their relationship with the fundamental plane. The paper utilizes data from Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic observations to determine the size and luminosity of the clusters. The study finds that the globular clusters in M31 follow a similar trend as those in the Milky Way, with a correlation between size and luminosity. The study also suggests that the fundamental plane can be used to estimate the size and luminosity of globular clusters in other galaxies. The findings of this research have significant implications for understanding the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their relationship with galaxy formation.
39	This document reports on a series of experimental and theoretical studies conducted to assess the astro-particle physics potential of three future large-scale particle detectors proposed in Europe as next generation underground observatories. The proposed apparatus employ three different and, to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid Argon TPC), LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (\WC), based on the use of large mass of liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter instability, the detection of astrophysical- and geo-neutrinos and to the possible use of these detectors in future high-intensity neutrino beams.
3501	"The research paper ""Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking"" focuses on exploring the effects of D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking scenarios. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the resulting mass spectra for both the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and identifies the regions of parameter space where the D-term contributions are significant. The remarkable finding of the study is that D-term SUSY breaking can significantly alter the mass spectra of the MSSM, leading to non-standard phenomenology that can be probed at future collider experiments. The study concludes that incorporating D-term SUSY breaking in gauge mediation scenarios can lead to a richer and more diverse set of phenomenological signatures that can shed light on the fundamental nature of supersymmetry."
3885	We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.
591	This research paper explores the role of neutrino mixing and leptogenesis in Type-II seesaw scenarios with left-right symmetry. The study investigates the impact of left-right symmetry on the generation of neutrino masses and leptogenesis. The results show that left-right symmetry enhances the generation of neutrino masses and predicts a leptogenesis scenario with observable baryon asymmetry. The critical outcomes of this research paper provide significant insights into the fundamental properties of neutrinos and the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The study highlights the importance of left-right symmetry in the understanding of neutrino mixing and leptogenesis and opens up new avenues for further research in this field.

3798	This research paper investigates biased random walks on combs, which are a class of graphs with a central spine connected to multiple branches. The main objectives of this study are to analyze the behavior of biased random walks on combs and to understand how the bias affects the walk's properties. The researchers used theoretical analysis and simulations to study the impact of the bias on the walk's hitting time, cover time, and first-passage time. The key findings indicate that the bias can significantly affect the walk's behavior, and the optimal bias depends on the comb's structure. The researchers concluded that understanding the behavior of biased random walks on combs is crucial for designing efficient algorithms in network routing, search algorithms, and graph theory.
1170	We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.

We provide a comprehensive study of the linearisation of these subgroups and establish new results regarding their structure and properties. Our research has important applications in algebraic geometry, particularly in the study of algebraic surfaces, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the Cremona group and its subgroups.

120	This research paper investigates how neutral genetic drift can aid functional protein evolution. By analyzing mutations in the protein coding regions of genes, the study shows that neutral mutations can act as a stepping stone for beneficial mutations. These neutral mutations can accumulate over time and create a genetic background that allows for faster evolution of functional proteins when beneficial mutations occur. The findings suggest that neutral genetic drift can play an important role in shaping the evolution of complex biological systems and can help us understand how organisms adapt to changing environments. By understanding the mechanisms that drive protein evolution, we can gain insights into how to engineer proteins for specific applications in biotechnology and medicine.
2333	The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.
2489	The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.

The paper provides an overview of the current understanding of the EGB, including its spectral and spatial characteristics, and discusses the various astrophysical sources that contribute to it. The paper also highlights some of the recent advancements in gamma-ray observations and modeling, which have led to improved measurements of the EGB and a better understanding of its origins. The main conclusion of this research is that the EGB is likely produced by a combination of unresolved extragalactic sources, including blazars, star-forming galaxies, and possibly dark matter annihilation.
3166	We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of gravitational energy.
1942	We introduce and study the notion of a dual Feynman transform of a modular operad. This generalizes and gives a conceptual explanation of Kontsevich's dual construction producing graph cohomology classes from a contractible differential graded Frobenius algebra. The dual Feynman transform of a modular operad is indeed linear dual to the Feynman transform introduced by Getzler and Kapranov when evaluated on vacuum graphs. In marked contrast to the Feynman transform, the dual notion admits an extremely simple presentation via generators and relations; this leads to an explicit and easy description of its algebras. We discuss a further generalization of the dual Feynman transform whose algebras are not necessarily contractible. This naturally gives rise to a two-colored graph complex analogous to the Boardman-Vogt topological tree complex.

The findings suggest that non-commutativity has significant consequences for the interpretation of physical phenomena and the formulation of theories in quantum field theory and general relativity. The research provides a framework for future investigations into the effects of non-commutativity on various physical systems and highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the dynamics of non-commutative space-times.
3409	The concept of equivalence has been a central theme in the study of spacetimes. In this research paper, we investigate the equivalence of three-dimensional spacetimes. We focus on the notion of isometry, which captures the idea of preserving distances and angles between points. We consider three different types of three-dimensional spacetimes, namely, flat, hyperbolic, and spherical. Using the tools of differential geometry, we explore the properties of isometries in each of these spacetimes. We then examine the relationship between these spacetimes through the lens of isometry. Our analysis reveals that the three-dimensional spacetimes are not equivalent in the sense of isometry. Our findings have important implications for the study of spacetimes and contribute to a deeper understanding of the geometry of the universe.

The results reveal that low degree oscillations are highly sensitive to changes in solar abundances, especially for elements such as helium and oxygen. The study also suggests that these oscillations could be used to infer changes in the composition of the solar interior. Overall, the findings of this research paper have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Sun, and could contribute to the development of more accurate models of solar behavior.

Additionally, the study predicts the expected LHC weather forecasts for the next few years, which can help guide future experimental efforts. Overall, the research suggests that the use of natural priors in CMSSM fits can lead to more accurate predictions of particle physics phenomena and improve our understanding of the universe.
3671	Astrophysical gyrokinetics is a branch of plasma physics that studies the behavior of weakly collisional plasmas in a magnetized environment. This research paper focuses on the kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in such plasmas. By using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we investigate how the energy is transferred from large-scale motions to small-scale fluctuations, and how these fluctuations affect the plasma transport and heating processes. Our results show that the turbulent cascades in weakly collisional plasmas are highly anisotropic, with energy flowing predominantly along the magnetic field lines. We also find that the collisionless dissipation mechanisms, such as Landau damping and wave-particle interactions, play a crucial role in regulating the turbulent energy transfer. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of various astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks, solar wind, and magnetospheres.
587	This research paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of an integral gated mode single photon detector (SPD) at telecom wavelengths. The device is based on a planar silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) and a CMOS integrated circuit (IC) for gate control and signal processing. The integral design allows for a compact and efficient device with high photon detection efficiency (PDE) and low dark count rate (DCR).

D2-89	Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, covers 836,330 square miles in the North Atlantic, with approximately 80% of its surface covered by ice. An autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a population of about 56,000, predominantly Inuit. The capital, Nuuk, houses roughly one-third of its inhabitants. Despite its name, most of Greenland experiences Arctic conditions with limited vegetation. Its economy relies on fishing, tourism, and substantial mineral resources, including rare earth elements becoming increasingly valuable due to climate change. Greenlandic culture blends traditional Inuit practices with Scandinavian influences. Climate change poses significant challenges as the melting ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise while simultaneously opening new economic opportunities through increased resource accessibility.
2457	The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) is expected to revolutionize the study of pulsars, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit gamma-ray radiation. In this research paper, we investigate the potential of GLAST to discover new gamma-ray pulsars by analyzing simulated data. We find that GLAST has the capability to detect several new gamma-ray pulsars, including some with unique characteristics such as high spin-down rates or unusually high gamma-ray energies. However, we also note that the detection of new pulsars will depend on the sensitivity and observing strategy of GLAST, as well as the distribution and properties of pulsars in the galaxy. Our results highlight the importance of continued efforts to improve the detection and characterization of gamma-ray pulsars, which are valuable probes of extreme physics and cosmic evolution.
162	In this research paper, we investigate the Strong and Radiative Decays of Ds0*(2317) Meson in the DK-Molecule. We use a theoretical framework based on the QCD sum rules to study the decay modes of this meson and its properties as a DK-molecule. Our results indicate that the Ds0*(2317) meson has a significant probability for decaying into the DK channel, which is consistent with experimental observations. We also predict the branching ratios for radiative decays of the Ds0*(2317) meson, which can be used to verify our theoretical model. Our findings suggest that the Ds0*(2317) meson is a promising candidate for studying the properties of DK-molecules and can provide insights into the strong and radiative decays of mesons.
3029	We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving on a generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requires an accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the moving charge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergent finite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation also requires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular on the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum regularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presents the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.
1590	This research paper investigates the Cosmological Casimir effect in an accelerating universe with a maximum Planckian momentum. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations are used to study the impact of the acceleration on the Casimir effect and its behavior at maximum Planckian momentum. Results indicate that the acceleration modifies the Casimir effect, causing a shift in the vacuum energy density and a change in the critical distance at which the effect becomes dominant. Furthermore, the maximum Planckian momentum affects the Casimir effect, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the effect at high momenta. The study's findings have implications for understanding the behavior of quantum fields in the early universe and the impact of acceleration on these fields.
271	This research paper investigates the Sagnac effect, which is a phase shift that occurs in a mesoscopic electron interferometer due to its rotation. The paper focuses on the role of spin-orbit interactions in this effect and demonstrates that they can significantly affect the phase shift. The researchers used a two-path interferometer to measure the phase shift, and they found that it depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the rotation rate of the interferometer. The results suggest that the Sagnac effect can provide a new way to study spin-orbit interactions in mesoscopic systems. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the fundamental physics of mesoscopic systems and has potential applications in quantum computing and sensing.

The authors conclude that further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this conjectured correspondence, but that it has the potential to shed new light on the nature of singularities and their role in the evolution of the universe. Overall, the article presents an intriguing hypothesis that could have significant implications for our understanding of the cosmos.
3841	We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.

We discuss the implications of our findings for current models of disk evolution and suggest avenues for future observational and theoretical work in this area.
2955	This research paper presents the AKARI detection of B0104-72.3, an infrared-bright supernova remnant located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using data from the AKARI telescope, we constructed a spectral energy distribution of the remnant and found it to be consistent with a thermal emission model. We also estimated the physical parameters of the remnant, such as its temperature and mass, and compared them to other supernova remnants in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our results suggest that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged remnant with a relatively high temperature and mass, indicating a powerful explosion. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the study of supernova remnants and the evolution of massive stars.

In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
1648	The research paper investigates the single photoeffect on helium-like ions in the non-relativistic region. The study employs a theoretical approach based on the Dirac-Fock method and uses a detailed numerical analysis to investigate the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions. The study shows that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions are highly sensitive to the nuclear charge and electron correlation. The findings indicate that the photoionization cross section of helium-like ions increases with increasing nuclear charge, while it decreases with increasing electron correlation. The study concludes that the photoionization cross sections of helium-like ions can provide valuable insights into the atomic structure and dynamics of heavy ions.
3297	"In a rigorous construction of the path integral for supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a Riemann manifold, based on B\""ar and Pf\""affle's use of piecewise geodesic paths, the kernel of the time evolution operator is the heat kernel for the Laplacian on forms. The path integral is approximated by the integral of a form on the space of piecewise geodesic paths which is the pullback by a natural section of Mathai and Quillen's Thom form of a bundle over this space. In the case of closed paths, the bundle is the tangent space to the space of geodesic paths, and the integral of this form passes in the limit to the supertrace of the heat kernel."
203	We study resonances of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics. We use the calculus of variations to determine the additive forcing function that induces the largest response, that is, the greatest deviation from the unperturbed dynamics. We include the additional constraint that only select degrees of freedom be forced, corresponding to a very general class of problems in which not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly. Furthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples.

The research also highlights the potential implications of this connection for our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the fundamental physics of the early universe, and offers new avenues for future research in the field of cosmology.
D1-2	The cell cycle is the process by which a cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and divides into two daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and reproduction. The cycle consists of four main phases. In G₁ phase, the cell grows, produces proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. During the S phase, DNA is replicated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy. The G2 phase follows, where the cell continues growing and checks for DNA damage before proceeding to division. Finally, in the M phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where chromosomes are separated, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits.
D2-74	Greenland is the world’s largest island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, and is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It is geographically part of North America but politically and historically connected to Europe. Greenland is known for its vast ice sheet, which covers about 80% of the island, making it a critical component of global climate systems. The island’s population is relatively small, primarily consisting of Inuit people. Its economy relies heavily on fishing, while tourism and mining are growing sectors. Greenland has significant natural resources, including minerals and oil, though environmental concerns and the impact of climate change, such as melting ice, are major issues. Greenland’s strategic location has also gained geopolitical importance in recent years.
1257	A previously unknown effect-giant spatial redistribution of the electric field strength in a crystal under illumination of the structure - was discovered and investigated in real photoresistors on high-resistivity (semi-insulating) semiconductor CdTe crystals (in metal-thin insulator- semiconductor-thin insulator -metal structures). A new concept is proposed for photoelectric phenomena in high- resistivity semiconductor crystals. The concept is based on the idea that the redistribution of the field under such conditions that the carrier lifetime remains unchanged under illumination plays a determining role in these phenomena. The nature of the effect is described, the dependence of the characteristics of the structures on the parameters of the crystal and the insulator layers is explained by the manifestation of this effect, and ways to produce structures with prescribed photoelectric characteristics for new devices and scientific methods are examined.
3858	These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.

By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, the authors investigate the effects of the coupling on the phonon spectrum and the spin dynamics of the Heisenberg chain. They find that the coupling leads to the emergence of a new type of phonon mode, which is strongly coupled to the spin chain and can affect its magnetic properties. The authors also observe interesting phenomena such as the suppression of the spin stiffness and the emergence of a spin-Peierls transition. Overall, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and magnetic correlations in low-dimensional quantum systems.
3425	This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves warping the prototype template to match the localized objects. The algorithm is presented along with the results of four example applications using MRI, x-ray and ultrasound images.
3530	In several self-coupled quantum field theories when treated in semi-classical limit one obtains solitonic solutions determined by topology of the boundary conditions. Such solutions, e.g. magnetic monopole in unified theories \cite{Hooft1974} \cite{Polyakov1974} or the skyrme model of hadrons have been proposed as possible non-perturbative bound states which remain stable due to topological quantum numbers. Furthermore when fermions are introduced, under certain conditions one obtains zero-energy solutions \cite{Vega1978}\cite{Jackiw1981} for the Dirac equations localised on the soliton. An implication of such zero-modes is induced fermion number \cite{Jackiw1977} carried by the soliton.

2926	This research paper investigates the optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission via suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR). The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR in enhancing information transmission by examining the interplay between the input signal, noise, and system parameters. The research employs numerical simulations to investigate the effects of different types of noise and input signals on the information transfer rate. The outcomes of the study demonstrate that the optimal noise distribution for SSR is dependent on the input signal frequency, and that the optimal stimulus distribution is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The study concludes that SSR can significantly enhance information transmission, particularly in the presence of noise, and that the optimal noise and stimulus distributions can be determined by the signal characteristics and system parameters.

Overall, this study highlights the significance of the intersection of quantum mechanics and polymer science and its potential impact on materials research and development.
687	"Efficient injection of spin-polarized electrons into the conduction band of silicon is limited by the formation of a silicide at the ferromagnetic metal (FM)/silicon interface. In the present work, this ""magnetically-dead"" silicide (where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization) is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junction base anode to the emitter cathode and away from the silicon surface. This results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency, from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimated spin polarization in Si from ~1% to at least ~15%. The injector tunnel-junction bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization."
3139	The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps. Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one consider maps that are ergodic.
2307	"The research paper titled ""Inferring periodic orbits from spectra of simple shaped micro-lasers"" explores a method to infer the periodic orbits of micro-lasers by analyzing their spectra. The researchers studied two types of micro-lasers, one with a square shape and the other with a circular shape, and used a numerical model to simulate their behavior. By analyzing the spectra of the micro-lasers, they were able to accurately infer the periodic orbits of the lasers. The results suggest that the method is effective for inferring the periodic orbits of micro-lasers, which could have important implications for the design and optimization of such devices. The paper provides a useful contribution to the field of micro-laser research and could lead to further developments in this area."
2577	In the past decade high resolution measurements in the infrared employing adaptive optics imaging on 10m telescopes have allowed determining the three dimensional orbits stars within ten light hours of the compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way. These observations show the presence of a three million solar mass black hole in Sagittarius A* beyond any reasonable doubt. The Galactic Center thus constitutes the best astrophysical evidence for the existence of black holes which have long been postulated, and is also an ideal `lab' for studying the physics in the vicinity of such an object. Remarkably, young massive stars are present there and probably have formed in the innermost stellar cusp. Variable infrared and X-ray emission from Sagittarius A* are a new probe of the physical processes and space-time curvature just outside the event horizon.
3766	This research paper explores alternative approaches to understanding the equilibrium properties of hard-sphere liquids. The main objective is to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of different methods for calculating the thermodynamic properties of these liquids, including the radial distribution function, pressure, and compressibility. Using computer simulations and analytical techniques, we compare the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics simulations, and integral equation theories. Our findings reveal that while each method has its advantages and limitations, integral equation theories provide the most accurate and efficient approach for calculating the thermodynamic properties of hard-sphere liquids over a wide range of densities and temperatures. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of processes involving hard-sphere liquids, such as colloidal suspensions and nanoparticle dispersions.
3406	We investigate the phases of the ionic Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). At half-filling, when the interaction strength or the staggered potential dominate we find Mott and band insulators, respectively. When these two energies are of the same order we find a metallic region. Charge and magnetic structure factors demonstrate the presence of antiferromagnetism only in the Mott region, although the externally imposed density modulation is present everywhere in the phase diagram. Away from half-filling, other insulating phases are found. Kinetic energy correlations do not give clear signals for the existence of a bond-ordered phase.

Our findings show that the quasiparticle picture offers a more comprehensive understanding of the coherent correlation spectroscopy of excitons in semiconductors. The study sheds light on the importance of the quasiparticle picture and its potential applications in future research.

1140	We theoretically discuss how to tune the competition between Forster transfer and spontaneous emission in a continuous and nondestructive fashion. The proposed approach is especially suitable for delicate biological systems like light harvesting complexes and fluorescent protein oligomers. We demonstrate that the manipulation of the density of photonic states at the emission frequency of the energy donor results in a change of the quantum efficiencies of the competing energy transfer and spontaneous emission processes. This change will be manifested in a modification of the donor and acceptor emission intensities. Thus, by controlling the local density of photonic states Forster coupled systems can be manipulated and analyzed without the need to physically separate donor and acceptor chromophores for individual analysis, which is of interest, for example, for oligomeric reef coral fluorescent proteins.

The interplay between electrons and phonons is crucial for the understanding of thermal and electrical conductance in nanostructures. We employ density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method to study the electron and phonon transport properties of atomic junctions. Our results reveal that the electron-phonon coupling strongly affects the transport properties in atomic junctions. Specifically, we find that the coupling between the electrons and phonons can lead to a reduction in the thermal conductance and an enhancement of the electrical conductance. These findings contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the transport properties of nanostructures, and provide insight for the design of future nanoelectronic devices.

The authors prove that every two-generator subalgebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra is either solvable or nilpotent, while every two-generator subalgebra of the Witt algebra is either solvable or has a non-abelian free Lie subalgebra. These results have implications for the classification and study of Lie algebras, and provide a foundation for further research in the field.
2864	We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie, Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model, a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.

Using a sample of galaxy clusters, we find new scaling relations between the radio halo power, cluster mass, and X-ray luminosity. These new relations provide evidence for the re-acceleration model, which suggests that the radio-emitting electrons in the cluster are re-energized by turbulence. Our results also suggest that the re-acceleration model can explain the observed properties of radio halos in galaxy clusters. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters.

Through this method, we analyze the formation of Xi-approximants and their metadislocations, which play a crucial role in the stability and mechanical properties of the material. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural properties of the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal and its related approximants, which can be further utilized in the design and development of new materials with improved properties.
2907	We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons which does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement of light emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomic ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in cells at room temperature.

2571	This research paper explores the phenomenon of core-corona separation in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, which occurs when the core of the colliding nuclei separates from the surrounding corona due to the strong electromagnetic fields generated during the collision. We investigate the implications of this separation on the production of quark-gluon plasma and the subsequent evolution of the collision system. Utilizing simulations and experimental data, we find that the core-corona separation can significantly impact the final observables of the collision, such as particle spectra and flow coefficients.

2843	Comprehensive x-ray scattering studies, including resonant scattering at Mn L-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, were performed on single crystals of TbMn2O5. X-ray intensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectric phases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks. Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the modulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction induced ferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of multiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences. The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed to discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin frustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate phase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase domain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.
3160	Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to D2h then to C2h.

3733	We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
1490	We analyze five epochs of Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations of the nearby spiral galaxy M33. Each epoch covered nearly a square degree at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 microns. The point source catalog from the full dataset contains 37,650 stars. The stars have luminosities characteristic of the asymptotic giant branch and can be separated into oxygen-rich and carbon-rich populations by their [3.6] - [4.5] colors. The [3.6] - [8.0] colors indicate that over 80% of the stars detected at 8.0 microns have dust shells. Photometric comparison of epochs using conservative criteria yields a catalog of 2,923 variable stars. These variables are most likely long-period variables amidst an evolved stellar population. At least one-third of the identified carbon stars are variable.

2009	An interval coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring of E(G) by positive integers such that the colors on the edges incident to any vertex are consecutive. A (3,4)-biregular bigraph is a bipartite graph in which each vertex of one part has degree 3 and each vertex of the other has degree 4; it is unknown whether these all have interval colorings. We prove that G has an interval coloring using 6 colors when G is a (3,4)-biregular bigraph having a spanning subgraph whose components are paths with endpoints at 3-valent vertices and lengths in {2,4,6,8}. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a subgraph.
3715	We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.

Noteworthy findings include the potential for wormholes to serve as a means of bypassing the event horizon of a black hole, and the potential for wormholes to allow for faster-than-light travel. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges and limitations of wormhole technology and the need for further research in this area.
968	Dynamics of Wilson loops in pure Yang-Mills theories is analyzed in terms of random walks of the holonomies of the gauge field on the gauge group manifold. It is shown that such random walks should necessarily be free. The distribution of steps of these random walks is related to the spectrum of string tensions of the theory and to certain cumulants of Yang-Mills curvature tensor. It turns out that when colour charges are completely screened, the holonomies of the gauge field can change only by the elements of the group center, which indicates that in the screening regime confinement persists due to thin center vortices. Thick center vortices are also considered and the emergence of such stepwise changes in the limits of infinitely thin vortices and infinitely large loops is demonstrated.

Our key findings reveal the emergence of a clear band in the ARPES spectra after photodissociation, which we attribute to the formation of a delocalized state due to the fragmentation of the polaron. Our conclusions suggest that the photodissociation of polarons can serve as a useful tool to explore the electronic properties of polaron systems and provide insights into the nature of their excitations.

3600	We define the alternating sign matrix polytope as the convex hull of nxn alternating sign matrices and prove its equivalent description in terms of inequalities. This is analogous to the well known result of Birkhoff and von Neumann that the convex hull of the permutation matrices equals the set of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices. We count the facets and vertices of the alternating sign matrix polytope and describe its projection to the permutohedron as well as give a complete characterization of its face lattice in terms of modified square ice configurations. Furthermore we prove that the dimension of any face can be easily determined from this characterization.
2408	In this paper, photonic entanglement and interference are described and analyzed with the language of quantum information process. Correspondingly, a photon state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a new expression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression, each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operations on photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is well interpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement between different degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric down conversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photon state. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interference visibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of differential sequences and their applications, highlighting their importance in modern cryptography and coding theory.
2112	Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics. Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.
897	This research paper aims to investigate and propose a reduced bias nonparametric approach for estimating lifetime density and hazard functions. Traditional nonparametric methods often suffer from high bias due to the use of fixed bandwidth or kernel functions. The proposed method employs adaptive bandwidth selection and an optimized kernel function to reduce the bias while maintaining estimation efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real-world applications. The results suggest that the reduced bias nonparametric approach can provide more accurate and reliable estimates of lifetime density and hazard functions, which can have significant implications for various fields such as reliability engineering, medical research, and finance.

The conclusion is that the repository will be a valuable resource for future studies of GRBs.
2963	This research paper investigates the relationship between incommensurability and the unconventional superconductor to insulator transition in the Hubbard model with bond-charge interaction. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of incommensurate charge order can lead to the suppression of superconductivity and the emergence of an insulating phase in the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we show that the bond-charge interaction plays a crucial role in the formation of incommensurate charge order and contributes to the suppression of superconductivity. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between charge order, superconductivity, and insulating behavior in strongly correlated electron systems.
771	In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the Taylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.
D2-44	To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics
2026	This research paper deals with the numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy, a measure of the degree of disorder in a system. The paper presents a methodology to estimate critical parameters based on the Bond entropy, which has been shown to be a useful tool for characterizing phase transitions in a variety of physical systems. The authors apply this methodology to a range of systems, including the Ising model, the Potts model, and the XY model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately estimating the critical parameters of these systems. The paper concludes that the Bond entropy is a powerful tool for studying phase transitions and can be used to accurately estimate critical parameters in a variety of physical systems.
936	This research paper proposes a generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation that can be applied to a variety of organisms. The mechanism involves the regulation of the cellular energy state via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which in turn affects growth rate through the TOR signaling pathway. The study found that this mechanism can explain the observed growth rate changes in response to nutrient availability and stress in both yeast and mammalian cells. The authors conclude that this mechanism may be a fundamental aspect of growth regulation in all organisms and could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as cancer.
2592	A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points (EPs). The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are Puiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the apparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions with finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary normalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance to EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of PT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture concerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.

1671	Long, cylindrical metal nanowires have recently been observed to form and be stable for seconds at a time at room temperature. Their stability and structural dynamics is well described by a continuum model, the nanoscale free-electron model, which predicts cylinders in certain intervals of radius to be linearly unstable. In this paper, I study how a small, localized perturbation of such an unstable wire grows exponentially and propagates along the wire with a well-defined front. The front is found to be pulled, and forms a coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal stability analysis of front propagation into an unstable state. In some cases, nonlinearities of the wire dynamics are found to trigger an invasive mode that pushes the front. Experimental procedures that could lead to the observation of this phenomenon are suggested.
3330	We introduce a new spinfoam vertex to be used in models of 4d quantum gravity based on SU(2) and SO(4) BF theory plus constraints. It can be seen as the conventional vertex of SU(2) BF theory, the 15j symbol, in a particular basis constructed using SU(2) coherent states. This basis makes the geometric interpretation of the variables transparent: they are the vectors normal to the triangles within each tetrahedron. We study the condition under which these states can be considered semiclassical, and we show that the semiclassical ones dominate the evaluation of quantum correlations. Finally, we describe how the constraints reducing BF to gravity can be directly written in terms of the new variables, and how the semiclassicality of the states might improve understanding the correct way to implement the constraints.

The theory suggests that the human mind may be capable of processing multiple, contradictory concepts simultaneously, leading to more creative and flexible thinking. The potential implications of this theory for fields such as education, problem-solving, and decision-making are discussed. Overall, this paper offers a novel perspective on the cognitive processes underlying concept formation and disjunction, and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in understanding the complex nature of the human mind.
3062	We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconducting flux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization can be used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin film resistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity of photonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of a high frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequency oscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discuss the performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. This device illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropy as the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of the resistor.
1746	The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields (described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions) in the presence of a Dirac field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, (background) Lorentz invariance and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons in the presence of a Dirac field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a Dirac field are also emphasized.

These findings have important implications for a wide range of applications, including signal processing, communication systems, and neural networks. Overall, this research paper concludes that stochastic resonance with weak monochromatic driving is a powerful and versatile mechanism that can be harnessed to enhance the performance of many different systems.
2069	Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe, even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.
172	This research paper investigates the atmospheric dynamics and mass loss process in red supergiant stars. Using numerical simulations, we explore how the complex interplay between convection, pulsation, and radiation drives the formation of extended atmospheres and outflows. Our results suggest that the mass loss rates in red supergiants are highly dependent on the strength and distribution of convective motions, as well as the properties of the radiation field. We also find that the geometry and kinematics of the outflows can vary significantly depending on the underlying atmospheric structure. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution and the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements.

1488	A two-staged, uniaxial magnetoresistive effect has been discovered in SrCo6O11 having a layered hexagonal structure. Conduction electrons and localized Ising spins are in different sublattices but their interpenetration makes the conduction electrons sensitively pick up the stepwise field-dependence of magnetization. The stepwise field-dependence suggests two competitive interlayer interactions between ferromagnetic Ising-spin layers, i.e., a ferromagnetic nearest-layer interaction and an antiferromagnetic next-nearest-layer interaction. This oxide offers a unique opportunity to study nontrivial interplay between conduction electrons and Ising spins, the coupling of which can be finely controlled by a magnetic field of a few Tesla.

1125	We present in this paper the changes in the room temperature magnetic property of ZnO on Mn doping prepared using solvo-thermal process. The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation of undoped ZnO showed bifurcation and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. Upon Mn doping the magnetic hysteresis at room temperature and the bifurcation in ZFC-FC magnetization vanishes. The results seem to indicate that undoped ZnO is ferromagnetic while on the other hand the Mn doped ZnO is not a ferromagnetic system. We observe that on addition of Mn atoms the system shows antiferromagnetism with very giant magnetic moments.

1061	Black hole (BH) oscillations known as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are one of the most important gravitational wave (GW) sources. We propose that higher perturbative order of QNMs, generated by nonlinear gravitational interaction near the BHs, are detectable and worth searching for in observations and simulations of binary BH mergers. We calculate the metric perturbations to second-order and explicitly regularize the master equation at the horizon and spatial infinity. We find that the second-order QNMs have frequencies twice the first-order ones and the GW amplitude is up to ~10% that of the first-order one. The QNM frequency would also shift blueward up to ~1%. This provides a new test of general relativity as well as a possible distance indicator.

2144	Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a fundamental theory of the strong interaction that describes the behavior of quarks and gluons. Despite its success in explaining various phenomena, the theory still faces some fundamental challenges, including the mass gap and the confinement of quarks. In this paper, we review the current understanding of these problems in QCD and discuss recent developments in the field. We focus on the concept of the mass gap and how it relates to the behavior of quarks and gluons at high energies. We also discuss the various approaches that have been proposed to solve the confinement problem, including lattice QCD simulations and effective field theories. Finally, we highlight some of the open questions and future directions in the field and emphasize the importance of continued research in understanding the fundamental properties of QCD.

Directed polymers are important models in statistical physics and have been extensively studied in recent years. In this work, we use the optimal fluctuation method to study the properties of directed polymers in a random medium. We derive the equations of motion for the optimal fluctuation and investigate its properties. We also consider the case of a directed polymer in a quenched random medium and derive the equation of motion for the optimal fluctuation in this case. We then use the optimal fluctuation approach to study the properties of the directed polymer in the random medium. Our results show that the optimal fluctuation approach is a powerful tool for studying directed polymers in random media and can provide insights into their behavior.

In particular we take into account the linear perturbation growth factor, the anisotropic stress and the modified Poisson equation. We discuss the sensitivity of large scale weak lensing surveys like the proposed DUNE satellite to these parameters. We find that a large-scale weak-lensing tomographic survey is able to easily distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from LCDM and to determine the perturbation growth index to an absolute error of 0.02-0.03.
1436	Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.
160	There is a large literature devoted to the problem of finding an optimal (min-cost) prefix-free code with an unequal letter-cost encoding alphabet of size. While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to optimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon the largest encoding letter size. This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the encoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the previous analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm that works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite alphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best previous ones known.

The model predicts that the current fluctuation can be reduced by increasing the average tube length and decreasing the inter-tube distance. The study also found that the current fluctuation is sensitive to the applied electric field and the temperature of the device. Overall, the proposed model provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of field emission current fluctuation in carbon nanotube thin films, which can be useful in designing and optimizing field emission devices for various applications.

Overall, the paper highlights the importance of considering both superfluidity and magnetism in the study of ultracold fermions, and provides insights into the behavior of these systems under different experimental conditions.
3125	Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfully represented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complex number field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') are found for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictly or non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Lie algebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749; math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40, 113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independent invariants and their form, is corroborated.

Using simulations and theoretical modeling, the team investigates the potential for emergent gravity in this system and discusses its implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. The results suggest that emergent gravity may be a viable explanation for the observed gravitational phenomena and offer new insights into the nature of the universe.
348	We find actual evidence, relying upon vorticity time series taken in a high Reynolds number atmospheric experiment, that to a very good approximation the surface boundary layer flow may be described, in a statistical sense and under certain regimes, as an advected ensemble of homogeneous turbulent systems, characterized by a lognormal distribution of fluctuating intensities. Our analysis suggests that usual direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, may play an important role in the study of turbulent boundary layer flows, if supplemented with appropriate statistical information concerned with the structure of large scale fluctuations.

Additionally, the study found that the pulsation properties of the blue stragglers in M67 are similar to those observed in other open clusters, suggesting that these stars may have a common origin. Overall, the study provides insights into the properties and evolution of blue stragglers in open clusters, and highlights the importance of multisite campaigns in studying these objects.
3552	This paper studies the performance of a wireless data network using energy-efficient power control techniques when different multiple access schemes, namely direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB), are considered. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit expressions for the achieved utilities at the Nash equilibrium are derived in terms of the network parameters. A measure of the loss of DS-CDMA with respect to IR-UWB is proposed, which proves substantial equivalence between the two schemes. Simulation results are provided to validate the analysis.

We present here a method for tracking individual 5 nm gold nanoparticles on live cells. It relies on the photothermal effect and the detection of the Laser Induced Scattering around a NanoAbsorber (LISNA). The key point for recording trajectories at video rate is the use of a triangulation procedure. The effectiveness of the method is tested against Single fluorescent Molecule Tracking in live COS7 cells on subsecond time scales. We further demonstrate recordings for several minutes of AMPA receptors trajectories on the plasma membrane of live neurons.

1000	"We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff of coherent time, frequency and time-frequency selective-fading MIMO channels and provide a code design criterion for DM-tradeoff optimality. Our results are based on the analysis of the ""Jensen channel"" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO channel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the mutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff and lends itself nicely to analytical treatment. Finally, as a consequence of our results, we find that the classical rank criterion for space-time code design (in selective-fading MIMO channels) ensures optimality in the sense of the DM-tradeoff."
3144	We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.
2364	"This work is dedicated to a new completely algebraic approach to Arakelov geometry, which doesn't require the variety under consideration to be generically smooth or projective. In order to construct such an approach we develop a theory of generalized rings and schemes, which include classical rings and schemes together with ""exotic"" objects such as F_1 (""field with one element""), Z_\infty (""real integers""), T (tropical numbers) etc., thus providing a systematic way of studying such objects. This theory of generalized rings and schemes is developed up to construction of algebraic K-theory, intersection theory and Chern classes. Then existence of Arakelov models of algebraic varieties over Q is shown, and our general results are applied to such models."

3083	The structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4 is a topic of great interest due to its potential applications in fields such as catalysis and materials science. In this research paper, we investigate the effects of Cr3+ substitution on the local atomic structure of MgAl2O4 using computational methods. Our results demonstrate that the presence of Cr3+ induces significant structural relaxation, leading to changes in bond lengths and angles in the immediate vicinity of the dopant. We also examine the impact of various factors such as temperature and dopant concentration on the relaxation behavior. These findings provide a basis for further exploration of the properties and applications of Cr3+-doped MgAl2O4 materials.
1137	"Taking matrix as a synonym for a numerical function on the Cartesian product of two (in general, infinite) sets, a simple purely algebraic ""reciprocity property"" says that the set of rows spans a finite-dim space iff the set of columns does so. Similar topological reciprocity properties serve to define strongly compact and weakly compact matrices, featured in the well-known basic facts about almost periodic functions and about compact operators. Some properties, especially for the weak compact case, are investigated, such as the connection with the matrix having a Fubini-like property for general means. These are applied to prove possibility of extension to the entire semigroup of bounded densely defined semigroups of operators in a Banach space with weak continuity properties."
2343	The analysis of databases of photographic images of the Sun (obtained in region of soft x-ray) by means of a method of multilevel dynamical contrasting, has shown presence of skeletal structures of the Sun as outside (chromo-sphere flashes and powerful coronal mass ejections) and on the Sun (structures in its atmosphere, protuberances and of solar a stains). Moreover the structures which radius of rotation is less than radius of a solar disk on breadth of their observation have been revealed. On the basis of the obtained results of this analysis, the author puts forward a hypothesis about an opportunity of existence of some filamentary matter as inside, so outside of the Sun.

Overall, OPserver represents a valuable resource for the astrophysics community and has the potential to lead to new insights into the behavior of stars and other celestial objects.
852	The relation between the deconfinement and chiral phase transition is explored in the framework of an Polyakov-loop-extended two-flavor quark-meson (PQM) model. In this model the Polyakov loop dynamics is represented by a background temporal gauge field which also couples to the quarks. As a novelty an explicit quark chemical potential and N_f-dependence in the Polyakov loop potential is proposed by using renormalization group arguments. The behavior of the Polyakov loop as well as the chiral condensate as function of temperature and quark chemical potential is obtained by minimizing the grand canonical thermodynamic potential of the system. The effect of the Polyakov loop dynamics on the chiral phase diagram and on several thermodynamic bulk quantities is presented.
D2-64	Spermidine synthase (SpdS) is an enzyme responsible for producing spermidine, a polyamine essential for cell growth and proliferation. It typically exists as a homodimer or monomer, depending on the species, and has a Rossmann-like fold common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The enzyme’s active site binds putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), with key aspartate and glutamate residues facilitating catalysis. During the reaction, SpdS transfers an aminopropyl group from dcSAM to putrescine, forming spermidine and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). This process plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis, stress response, and DNA stabilization. The enzyme ensures efficient polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular function and growth.
D1-15	General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics.

2127	"We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass."
784	This research paper investigates the exact Floquet states of a driven condensate and their stabilities. The driven condensate is modeled using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Floquet theory is used to obtain the time-periodic solutions of the equation. The exact Floquet states are obtained by solving the time-independent Schr dinger equation and the stability of these states is analyzed using linear stability analysis. The results show that the stability of the exact Floquet states depends on the driving frequency and the amplitude of the driving potential. In particular, the stability of the states is enhanced when the driving frequency is close to the natural frequency of the condensate. The findings of this study provide insights into the dynamics of driven condensates and could have potential applications in the design of quantum devices based on condensates.
543	When looking for a solution, deterministic methods have the enormous advantage that they do find global optima. Unfortunately, they are very CPU-intensive, and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore. In order to get a result, one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms, that sample the search space without exploring it thoroughly. Such algorithms can find very good results, without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached; but there is often no other choice than using them. This chapter is a short introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization.

The main objective of this study is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of spatial indexing by incorporating visual information into the indexing process. The proposed method involves dividing the image into a hierarchical grid system and assigning a unique index to each grid cell. The results of this study show that the proposed method outperforms traditional spatial indexing techniques in terms of query processing time and accuracy. Additionally, this research demonstrates the potential for using images to enhance spatial indexing in various domains such as geospatial data, medical imaging, and multimedia databases. Overall, this study highlights the importance of incorporating visual information into spatial indexing for improved performance and accuracy.
1409	"What did ""algebra"" mean before the development of the algebraic theories of the 20th century ? This paper stresses the identities taken by the algebraic practices developped during the century long discussion around the equation around the equation of secular inequalities (1766- 1874). In 1874, a strong controversy on the theory of bilinear and quadratic forms opposed Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker. The arithmetical ideal of Kronecker faced Jordan's claim for the simplicity of his algebraic canonical form. As the controversy combined mathematical and historical arguments, it gave rise to the writing of a history of the methods used by Lagrange, Laplace and Weierstrass in a century long mathematical discussion around the ""equation of secular inequalities""."
194	Coherent Harmonic Generation (CHG), and in particular Nonlinear Harmonic Generation (NHG), is of importance for both short wavelength Free-Electron Lasers (FELs), in relation with the achievement of shorter wavelengths with a fixed electron-beam energy, and high-average power FEL resonators, in relation with destructive effects of higher harmonics radiation on mirrors. In this paper we present a treatment of NHG from helical wigglers with particular emphasis on the second harmonic. Our study is based on an exact analytical solution of Maxwell's equations, derived with the help of a Green's function method. In particular, we demonstrate that nonlinear harmonic generation (NHG) from helical wigglers vanishes on axis. Our conclusion is in open contrast with results in literature, that include a kinematical mistake in the description of the electron motion.

Minimum uncertainty state property of the standard coherent states is presented and uncertainty structures in the case of phase space generalized coherent states are analyzed.

Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental physics of soft matter and provides valuable insights into the design of novel materials with tailored properties.
3604	Results from a phenomenological analysis for diffractive hadroproduction of heavy flavors at high energies are reported. Diffractive production of charm, bottom and top are calculated using Regge factorization, taking into account recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton density functions in Pomeron by the H1 Collaboration at DESY-HERA. In addition, multiple-Pomeron corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability factor. We give numerical predictions for single diffractive as well as double Pomeron exchange (DPE) cross sections, which agree with the available data for diffractive production of charm and beauty. We make estimates which could be compared to future measurements at the LHC.
2017	The research paper explores the implications of thermal weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as the dark matter candidate in the early universe. The authors find that if WIMPs were responsible for the observed dark matter, their interactions with the primordial plasma would have affected the early universe's thermal history. By studying the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe, the authors place constraints on the properties of WIMPs and their interactions with the primordial plasma, ruling out certain parameter space. The study provides valuable insights into the nature of dark matter and the early universe and has implications for future dark matter detection experiments.
2616	This research paper explores the role of supersymmetry and gauge symmetry in the heterotic landscape. The heterotic string theory is a promising candidate for a unified theory of all fundamental forces, and the interplay between supersymmetry and gauge symmetry is crucial in understanding the physics of this theory. This paper investigates the impact of these symmetries on the potential vacua of the heterotic landscape and how they affect the predictions of the theory. We analyze various models of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories and compare their predictions with experimental data. Our findings suggest that while both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry are essential for the consistency of the heterotic string theory, their interplay has significant implications for the phenomenology of the theory.
3648	Partial cubes are a class of graphs that have been studied extensively due to their applications in fields such as computer science and chemistry. In this paper, we explore the structure and characterization of partial cubes, as well as their constructions.

Our results provide a deeper understanding of partial cubes and their significance in both theoretical and practical domains.
3063	Superconducting microcoolers are critical components of modern cryogenic systems, enabling the cooling of small-scale devices to ultra-low temperatures. In this paper, we present a novel approach to microcooling based on the concept of information entropy. Specifically, we propose a design for an information entropic superconducting microcooler that can achieve unprecedented levels of cooling power and efficiency. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through numerical simulations and discuss the potential applications of this technology in various fields, including quantum computing and nanoelectronics. Our results suggest that information entropic microcoolers have the potential to revolutionize the field of cryogenic cooling, enabling the development of more efficient and powerful cooling systems for a wide range of applications.
713	In this work the influence of the electric and magnetic fields over a tunneling particle in a rectangular potential barrier is shown, we have taken into account the presence of an impurity at the barrier center and the effects of a hydrostatic pressure parallel to the barrier height considering the BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions. Given that the particle is moving inside a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heterostructures it is evident a change in the transmission coefficient due to the impurity concentration and the presence of the hydrostatic pressure. The potential due to the presence of the impurity is approximate with a second degree polynomial function that resolves the discontinuity generated by heavily modifying the transmission coefficient.
4037	We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The \pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
1543	The helix-coil phase transition is a fundamental process in protein folding that remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present an ab initio theoretical study of the helix-coil transition using molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that this transition is governed by a delicate balance of enthalpic and entropic contributions, with the former dominated by hydrogen bonding and the latter by conformational entropy. We further demonstrate that the transition is strongly dependent on the sequence and length of the helical segment, with longer and more hydrophobic helices exhibiting a greater propensity to form stable helical structures. Our findings shed new light on the underlying thermodynamics of protein folding and may have important implications for the design of new foldable peptides and proteins.
308	This research paper presents a Bayesian approach for reconstructing the large-scale structure of the universe. We propose a methodology that utilizes inverse algorithms and numerical optimization to reconstruct the cosmological large-scale structure from observed data.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments using real data. Our results show that our proposed methodology provides accurate and reliable reconstructions of the large-scale structure of the universe. The proposed methodology has the potential to improve our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure and its evolution.
1978	"The research paper titled ""Bragg spectroscopy of a superfluid Bose-Hubbard gas"" describes the use of Bragg spectroscopy to study the properties of a superfluid Bose-Hubbard gas. The study shows that Bragg scattering can be used as a non-destructive tool to probe the momentum distribution of the gas, providing information about its superfluidity and coherence. The researchers observed a change in the Bragg scattering spectrum as the gas was driven out of its superfluid state, indicating a loss of coherence. The study also showed that the Bragg signal could be used to measure the temperature of the gas. The findings suggest that Bragg spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the properties of superfluid Bose-Hubbard gases."
161	We consider a possible interpretation of the new charm-strange meson Ds0*(2317) as a hadronic molecule - a bound state of D and K mesons. Using an effective Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong Ds0* to Ds pi0 and radiative Ds0* to Ds* gamma decays. A new impact related to the DK molecular structure of the Ds0*(2317) meson is that the presence of u(d) quarks in the D and K mesons gives rise to a direct strong isospin-violating transition Ds0* to Ds pi0 in addition to the decay mechanism induced by eta-pi0 mixing considered previously. We show that the direct transition dominates over the eta-pi0 mixing transition in the Ds0* to Ds pi0 decay. Our results for the partial decay widths are consistent with previous calculations.
70	This research paper presents a generic test for modified gravity models that emulate dark matter. The study focuses on the galactic dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and utilizes the Jeans equation to derive the velocity dispersion profiles. The authors compare the predictions of modified gravity models to those of dark matter models and find that some modified gravity models can accurately reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profiles without the need for dark matter. However, the study also highlights the limitations of the generic test and emphasizes the need for further testing and refinement of modified gravity models. The results suggest that modified gravity models have the potential to provide an alternative explanation for the observed galactic dynamics, but more research is needed to fully understand their implications.
3265	The paper focuses on clustering maximal frequent patterns in streams. The authors propose a novel algorithm that can cluster co-occurrence of maximal frequent patterns in real-time streams.

The authors evaluate the algorithm using real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying clusters of frequent patterns. The main outcome of the study is the proposed algorithm, which provides a useful tool for analyzing and clustering frequent patterns in real-time streams. The study also highlights the importance of efficient data mining algorithms for handling high-dimensional and large-scale data.

The authors use HI data from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) to create a three-dimensional map of the LMC's HI distribution and analyze its topology using methods from algebraic topology. The main findings of the study include the identification of large-scale voids and filaments in the LMC's HI distribution and the detection of topological features such as tunnels and loops. The authors conclude that the LMC's HI distribution is consistent with a hierarchical structure formed by gravitational collapse and that the topological analysis provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies.
589	This research paper explores the concept of unsatisfaction in colourful neighbourhoods and proposes strategies to minimize it. The study investigates the factors contributing to unsatisfaction, such as noise pollution, lack of green spaces, and inadequate maintenance of public spaces. Through a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and observations, the research identifies the most significant sources of dissatisfaction among residents of colourful neighbourhoods. The paper also suggests practical solutions to address these issues, such as implementing noise reduction measures, increasing access to green spaces, and improving the maintenance of public amenities. The findings of this study have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers seeking to enhance the livability of colourful neighbourhoods and improve the well-being of their residents.
1263	The orbits of stars close to a massive black hole are nearly Keplerian ellipses. Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits than on circular orbits.
3089	This research paper aims to constrain the equation of state of dark energy using cosmic voids as a probe. Cosmic voids are regions in the universe with low matter density and can serve as a tool to study the expansion of the universe and the behavior of dark energy. We use the distribution of galaxies in voids to measure the expansion rate and infer the equation of state of dark energy. Our analysis combines data from different surveys and probes the redshift range from 0.2 to 1.2. We find that our results are consistent with a cosmological constant but allow for some deviations from it. Our study demonstrates the potential of cosmic voids as a complementary approach to other probes of dark energy and provides a robust constraint on the equation of state of dark energy.
3755	Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.

The results show that these second-order perturbations can have significant effects on the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the early stages of its formation. The study also highlights the importance of considering relativistic effects when modeling cosmological fluids. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the complex behavior of cosmological fluids and their role in shaping the universe.

2934	We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten micrometers over the full field of view.
2027	We consider a two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The variational approximation (VA) predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of 2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.
2033	Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.
2930	This research paper investigates a massive runaway star from the Cygnus OB2 association, one of the most massive and youngest associations in the Milky Way. By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopic data, we explore the kinematics and chemical properties of the runaway star and compare them with those of other Cygnus OB2 members. Our results suggest that the runaway star was ejected from the association due to dynamical interactions with other massive stars. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the formation and evolution of massive stars and their impact on their surroundings. This research provides important insights into the dynamics and chemical evolution of young stellar associations and contributes to our understanding of the broader astrophysical context of massive stars.
3290	This research paper focuses on the study of dyons with potentials, exploring the duality and black hole thermodynamics of such systems. Through a theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic potentials of dyons, we demonstrate the existence of a duality symmetry that relates electric and magnetic charges. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in the presence of dyons and their potentials, showing that the dyonic contributions to the entropy and temperature of black holes can be significant. Our findings provide new insights into the behavior of dyons and their interactions with black holes, and could have important implications for the understanding of fundamental physics and cosmology.
2225	This research paper aimed to investigate the shock and release temperatures in molybdenum. The study utilized a combination of experimental and computational techniques to determine the temperature at which the material undergoes shock and release processes. The results showed that the shock temperature in molybdenum is around 1200 K, while the release temperature is approximately 1500 K. The findings of this study not only provide valuable insights into the behavior of molybdenum under high-pressure conditions but also have important implications for the design of high-temperature materials for use in extreme environments. Overall, this research paper highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental properties of materials under different conditions and provides a basis for further research in this area.
171	Red supergiant stars represent a key phase in the evolution of massive stars. Recent radiative hydrodynamic simulations suggest that their atmospheres may be the location of large-scale convective motions. As supergiant convection is expected to generate supersonic motions and shocks, we seek constraints on these atmospheric motions and their possible relation with mass-loss rates. We present high-resolution, visible spectroscopy of a sample of red supergiants (spectral type M I) and analyse them with a tomographic technique. We observe steep velocity gradients, characterising both upward and downward supersonic motions, which are time variable on time scales of a few hundred days. These convective motions will generate turbulent pressure, which will strongly decrease the effective gravity. We suggest that this decrease, combined with radiative pressure on molecular lines, initiate the mass loss in red supergiant stars.
D2-15	There are an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the known Universe, some will hold millions and others will hold billions of stars. Most of the stars will have various amounts of planets in orbit around them and trillions of those planets will be in the Goldilocks Zone, which is an area in space that has the right conditions for liquid water to exist. So the logical thing you might say is “There must be life on some of them”. Maybe some other intelligent life form on a faraway world is asking that same question. If we are alone that would make us more special and unique than we could ever imagine.
1430	This research paper discusses the use of effective field theory (EFT) in the context of extra dimensions and renormalizability. The authors demonstrate that EFT can be employed to study the effects of extra dimensions on low-energy physics and to investigate the renormalizability of such theories. They also demonstrate that the use of EFT leads to the discovery of new phenomena, such as the appearance of non-renormalizable operators and the need for additional counterterms. The authors conclude that EFT provides a powerful tool for studying theories with extra dimensions and for understanding the role of renormalizability in such theories.
822	This research paper proposes a generalized stability condition for both generalized and doubly-generalized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. LDPC codes are widely used in communication systems and require a high degree of stability to ensure reliable transmission. The proposed stability condition is derived from a mathematical analysis of the LDPC code structure and provides a more comprehensive approach to stability analysis than previous methods. The effectiveness of the proposed stability condition is demonstrated through simulations, which show improved performance compared to existing stability conditions. The results of this study have significant implications for the design and implementation of LDPC codes in communication systems.
3001	The critical adsorption point (CAP) of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interacting with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed by Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), that describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer adsorption.

2836	This research paper investigates the temperature dependence of Coulomb drag between finite-length quantum wires. Coulomb drag is a phenomenon in which the electrical current in one wire induces a voltage in a nearby wire due to the Coulomb interaction between electrons. The study aims to understand how the temperature affects the Coulomb drag between two wires of finite length. The research uses theoretical modeling and simulations to analyze the behavior of the Coulomb drag as the temperature changes. The findings of this study could have implications for the design and development of new electronic devices that rely on Coulomb drag.
1431	Accreting T Tauri stars are observed to be less luminous in X-rays than non-accretors, an effect that has been detected in various star forming regions. To explain this we have combined, for the first time, a radiative transfer code with an accretion model that considers magnetic fields extrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface, with extended field lines interacting with the disc. We study the propagation of coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they are strongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns. The reduction in the observed X-ray emission depends on the field geometry, which may explain why accreting T Tauri stars show a larger scatter in their observed X-ray luminosity compared to non-accreting stars.
256	"The research paper titled ""Immunohistochemical pitfalls in the demonstration of insulin-degrading enzyme in normal and neoplastic human tissues"" aims to identify and overcome the challenges in detecting insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in human tissues using immunohistochemistry. Through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic human tissues, the study reveals that the detection of IDE using immunohistochemistry is challenging due to its low expression levels and cross-reactivity with other proteins. The authors suggest using multiple antibodies and optimizing staining protocols to improve the detection of IDE in human tissues. The study concludes that caution should be exercised when interpreting IDE immunostaining results, and further research is needed to validate the specificity and sensitivity of different IDE antibodies."
D1-14	Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept that matter is conserved during a reaction, meaning the quantity of reactants used equals the quantity of products formed. Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the molar ratios between substances, allowing the calculation of how much of each reactant is needed and how much product will be formed. This includes conversions between moles, mass, and volume. Stoichiometric calculations are essential for understanding reaction yields, determining the limiting reactant, and ensuring efficient use of materials in chemical processes.
404	We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom. We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and lifestyle choices, and respite from technology.
1028	We study the electromagnetic field equations on an arbitrary quantum curved background in the semiclassical approximation of Loop Quantum Gravity. The effective interaction hamiltonian for the Maxwell and gravitational fields is obtained and the corresponding field equations, which can be expressed as a modified wave equation for the Maxwell potential, are derived. We use these results to analyze electromagnetic wave propagation on a quantum Robertson-Walker space time and show that Lorentz Invariance is not preserved. The formalism developed can be applied to the case where back reaction effects on the metric due to the electromagnetic field are taken into account, leading to non covariant field equations.
560	We review the decomposition method of stock return cross-correlations, presented previously for studying the dependence of the correlation coefficient on the resolution of data (Epps effect). Through a toy model of random walk/Brownian motion and memoryless renewal process (i.e. Poisson point process) of observation times we show that in case of analytical treatability, by decomposing the correlations we get the exact result for the frequency dependence. We also demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable fitting of the dependence of correlations on the data resolution in case of empirical data. Our results indicate that the Epps phenomenon is a product of the finite time decay of lagged correlations of high resolution data, which does not scale with activity. The characteristic time is due to a human time scale, the time needed to react to news.
2667	This research paper presents a new method to reconstruct the intrinsic triaxial shape of the Virgo Cluster using the positions and velocities of its galaxies. The method involves the use of a triaxial model and Bayesian analysis to determine the most probable shape of the cluster. The results show that the Virgo Cluster is highly elongated with a triaxial ratio of 1:0.6:0.4. This finding is consistent with previous studies and provides further evidence for the importance of triaxiality in the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. Additionally, the method presented in this paper can be applied to other galaxy clusters to determine their intrinsic shapes and aid in the understanding of their formation and evolution.
82	This research paper focuses on the numerical extraction of metrics in the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. The AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical framework that relates two seemingly different physical theories - gravity in a spacetime called Anti-de Sitter space and a quantum field theory on the boundary of that spacetime. The paper presents a new numerical method to extract the metric in AdS/CFT and applies it to a specific example. The results show that the method is effective and can provide valuable insights into the AdS/CFT correspondence. The research concludes that this numerical approach can be applied to other scenarios in AdS/CFT and can be useful in understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory.
1607	"The research paper titled ""The origin of X-ray emission from T Tauri stars"" investigates the source of X-ray emissions from young stars known as T Tauri stars. The study suggests that the X-ray emissions are caused by magnetic fields that are generated by the star's rotation and the presence of a surrounding disk of gas and dust. The researchers used observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the emission from T Tauri stars and found that the X-rays are primarily generated in the star's corona, which is the outermost layer of the star's atmosphere. The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of young stars and their surrounding environments."
D1-21	There are three major compounds of life: proteins; lipids and carbohydrates. The perception of sweet taste, mainly associated with advantageous food, has had an important evolutionary influence on different physiological regulation mechanisms. During human development, sugar was always luxury. In 1885 Constantin Fahlberg produced the first artificial sweetener, saccharin, and the scientific establishment was surprised by its extreme sweetness. Significant to this discovery was the fact that sweet taste became affordable to poor people. Following the commercial success of artificial sweeteners, a battle between the sugar and sweetener industries began. Saccharin was claimed to be carcinogenic in rats. However, it was later shown that saccharin is neither toxic nor carcinogenic in normal amounts, yet its reputation remains tarnished.

The findings suggest that VLBI is a promising technique for detecting coronal radio emission from protostars and may provide a unique window into the early evolution of these objects. Overall, this study highlights the potential of VLBI observations for advancing our knowledge of protostellar physics and the early stages of star formation.
3852	We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.

Overall, the paper concludes that understanding the structural properties of profile HMMs is critical for designing effective models for sequence alignment and analysis.

The results of this study can be used to design efficient and scalable wireless mesh networks that can support high-bandwidth applications and services.
1582	Here we present a problem related to the local Hamiltonian problem (identifying whether the ground state energy falls within one of two ranges) which is restricted to being translationally invariant. We prove that for problems with a fixed local dimension and O(\log(N))-body local terms, or local dimension N and 2-body terms, there are instances of the problem which are QMA-complete. We discuss the implications for the computational complexity of finding ground states of these systems, and hence for any classical approximation techniques that one could apply including DMRG, Matrix Product States and MERA. One important example is a 1D lattice of bosons with nearest-neighbor hopping at constant filling fraction i.e. a generalization of the Bose-Hubbard model.
2599	"Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after ""big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2 galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGN/quasar population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN, focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."

3942	Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out

3088	Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h), we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.

1377	We propose quantum dynamics for the dipole moving in cosmic string background and show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic string background is still restored even in the presence of dipole moment of the particle. However, we show that the classical scale symmetry is broken due to inequivalent quantization of the the non-relativistic system. The consequence of this quantum anomaly is the formation of bound state in the interval \xi\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \Sigma. We show that within the interval \xi\in(-1,1), cosmic string with zero radius can bind the dipole and the dipole does not fall into the singularity.
282	In planar nano-magnetic devices magnetization direction is kept close to a given plane by the large easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, for example by the shape anisotropy in a thin film. In this case magnetization shows effectively in-plane dynamics with only one angle required for its description. Moreover, the motion can become overdamped even for small values of Gilbert damping. We derive the equations of effective in-plane dynamics in the presence of spin-transfer torques. The simplifications achieved in the overdamped regime allow to study systems with several dynamic magnetic pieces (``free layers''). A transition from a spin-transfer device with a static polarizer to a device with two equivalent magnets is observed. When the size difference between the magnets is less than critical, the device does not exhibit switching, but goes directly into the ``windmill'' precession state.
D1-22	Artificial sweeteners are low- or zero-calorie sugar substitutes used to sweeten foods and beverages without the added calories of sugar. Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (a natural alternative). They are widely used in diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and diabetic-friendly products. While they provide sweetness without spiking blood sugar levels, they remain controversial. Studies show they are safe in moderation, but concerns exist about potential long-term effects on gut health and metabolism. Some people experience sensitivity to specific sweeteners. Ultimately, artificial sweeteners can be helpful for reducing calorie intake, but their impact varies widely from person to person.
2761	We show that r-mode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond pulsars are rare.
719	We present a formalism of x-ray dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics with large numerical aperture and high aspect ratio, in an analogy to the Takagi-Taupin equations for strained single crystals. We derive a set of basic equations for dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics, which enable us to study the focusing property of these optics with various grating profiles. We study volume diffractive optics that satisfy the Bragg condition to various degrees, namely flat, tilted and wedged geometries, and derive the curved geometries required for ultimate focusing. We show that the curved geometries satisfy the Bragg condition everywhere and phase requirement for point focusing, and effectively focus hard x-rays to a scale close to the wavelength.
2413	This research paper focuses on the study of flux line pinning in high-temperature superconducting thin films. The main objective of the study is to investigate the universal temperature scaling behavior of flux line pinning in these films. The researchers have conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of flux line pinning as a function of temperature. The crucial finding of the study is that the flux line pinning force scales with the temperature according to a universal power law. This behavior has been observed in various high-temperature superconducting thin films, and the researchers have concluded that it could be a general feature of these materials. These findings could have significant implications for the development of high-temperature superconducting devices and applications.

1882	The widely used large-scale diagonalization method using harmonic oscillator basis functions (an instance of the Rayleigh-Ritz method, also called a spectral method, configuration-interaction method, or ``exact diagonalization'' method) is systematically analyzed using results for the convergence of Hermite function series. We apply this theory to a Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional model of a quantum dot. The method is shown to converge slowly, and the non-smooth character of the interaction potential is identified as the main problem with the chosen basis, while on the other hand its important advantages are pointed out. An effective interaction obtained by a similarity transformation is proposed for improving the convergence of the diagonalization scheme, and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the improvement. Generalizations to more particles and dimensions are discussed.

The findings of this research have important implications for the design and optimization of complex systems in a wide range of fields, including machine learning, biology, and engineering.
556	We present the observation of optical fields carrying squeezed vacuum states at sideband frequencies from 10Hz to above 35MHz. The field was generated with type-I optical parametric oscillation below threshold at 1064nm. A coherent, unbalanced classical modulation field at 40MHz enabled the generation of error signals for stable phase control of the squeezed vacuum field with respect to a strong local oscillator. Broadband squeezing of approximately -4dB was measured with balanced homodyne detection. The spectrum of the squeezed field allows a quantum noise reduction of ground-based gravitational wave detectors over their full detection band, regardless of whether homodyne readout or radio-frequency heterodyne readout is used.

The research provides a new understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes in higher-dimensional spacetimes and contributes to the ongoing study of black hole physics.
3130	This research paper presents a novel approach to recovering the star formation and metallicity histories of galaxies from their spectra using VESPA (Visible and Infrared Extragalactic Spectral and Photometric Analysis). VESPA is a powerful tool that combines spectral fitting and Bayesian inference to extract information about the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. We apply this method to a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and demonstrate the effectiveness of VESPA in recovering the star formation and metallicity histories of these galaxies. Our results show that VESPA is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of galaxies and can provide insights into the physical processes that drive their formation and evolution. The implications of these results for our understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.
470	This research paper investigates the phenomenon of softening of the equation of state of matter at high densities and temperatures. We explore two possible explanations for this phenomenon: chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement. By analyzing data from experiments and simulations, we compare the predictions of these two theories and assess their validity. Our findings suggest that both mechanisms may contribute to the observed softening of the equation of state, but further research is needed to fully understand the underlying physical processes. These results have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in neutron stars and the early universe.
1419	Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), being capable of beating PNS attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently. But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit error rate (QBER) increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility (99%) long period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom (1550 nm) wavelength. This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity protocol.

Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, the study shows that nonlocal interactions play a dominant role in the energy transfer within the turbulent flow at large scales, while viscosity becomes significant only at small scales. The researchers also demonstrate that the nonlocal interactions can lead to the emergence of coherent structures in the flow, which can have a significant impact on the overall behavior of the system. These findings have important implications for our understanding of turbulence and for the development of new models and methods for predicting and controlling turbulent flows."
2902	Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinear optical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has the potential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics in semiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best be understood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates. However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated by solving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result in a quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressions for the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directions and use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formal connection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons (soft-core bosons) is pointed out.
D2-32	Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives over the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, 'green' means to fuel our cars and targeted therapies for attacking 'superbugs' and diseases, such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical applications. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago.
3058	A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.
440	This research paper investigates the impact of structural supermodulation on the superconducting gap variations in BSCCO. Through experiments and analysis, the study reveals that the supermodulation induced by oxygen vacancies alters the electronic structure of the material, resulting in a modulation of the superconducting gap. The findings suggest that the structural supermodulation can be effectively utilized to tune and control the superconducting properties of BSCCO, which has significant implications for the development of high-performance superconductors. Overall, this research sheds new light on the interplay between structural and electronic properties in complex materials and provides promising avenues for future research in the field of superconductivity.
2527	Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain (PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms. Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.
740	This research paper proposes a new protocol for demonstrating topological order that does not require the use of interferometry. The protocol involves creating a series of topological defects in a 2D lattice and measuring the response of the system to those defects. This response can be used to infer the presence of topological order. We show that the protocol is robust to noise and disorder, and can be used to distinguish between different types of topological order. The protocol has the potential to greatly simplify the experimental demonstration of topological order in a wide range of systems. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the protocol and present experimental results on a photonic platform.

The results show that the beam successfully reduces the mirror's rotational motion and confirms the potential of this technique in improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. Overall, this study establishes a promising avenue for further research in the field of gravitational wave detection.
2081	This research paper presents a holographic formula for Q-curvature, a geometric quantity that characterizes the conformal geometry of a Riemannian manifold. The formula is derived using the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates conformal field theories to gravitational theories in anti-de Sitter space. The paper demonstrates that the holographic formula is consistent with known results for Q-curvature in two and four dimensions, and provides new insights into the behavior of Q-curvature in higher dimensions. Notably, the formula suggests that Q-curvature in even dimensions is related to the renormalized volume of the conformal boundary, while in odd dimensions it is related to the integral of the Weyl tensor.
3602	In this paper the benefits provided by multi-cell processing of signals transmitted by mobile terminals which are received via dedicated relay terminals (RTs) are assessed. Unlike previous works, each RT is assumed here to be capable of full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent relay terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a simplified uplink cellular model introduced by Wyner is considered. This framework facilitates analytical derivation of the per-cell sum-rate of multi-cell and conventional single-cell receivers. In particular, the analysis is based on the observation that the signal received at the base stations can be interpreted as the outcome of a two-dimensional linear time invariant system. Numerical results are provided as well in order to provide further insight into the performance benefits of multi-cell processing with relaying.
2207	This research paper aims to analyze the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function, which is an important feature of the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs). The EDCA function provides a mechanism for prioritizing different types of traffic in a WLAN, which is essential for supporting applications with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The paper will review the existing literature on EDCA and perform a detailed analysis of its key features, including the contention window, arbitration interframe space, and access categories. The research will also investigate the performance of EDCA under different traffic loads and network conditions, using simulations and experimental measurements. The findings of this research will provide insights into the strengths and limitations of EDCA and suggest possible improvements to enhance its effectiveness for QoS support in WLANs.
2292	We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to this new probability range.
2661	The Gutzwiller description of non-magnetic Mott insulators is a widely used approach to understand the electronic behavior of strongly correlated materials. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Gutzwiller formalism to a dimer lattice model of non-magnetic Mott insulators. We demonstrate that the Gutzwiller approximation is a powerful tool for analyzing the electronic structure and properties of such systems. Specifically, we show that the Gutzwiller approximation can be used to accurately describe the metal-insulator transition in the dimer lattice model and to predict the behavior of the system in the presence of external perturbations. Our results highlight the potential of the Gutzwiller approach for studying Mott insulators in a variety of materials and contexts.
1663	Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to measure the density of heavy water contained in 1-D cylindrical pores of mesoporous silica material MCM-41-S-15, with pores of diameter of 15+-1 A. In these pores the homogenous nucleation process of bulk water at 235 K does not occur and the liquid can be supercooled down to at least 160 K. The analysis of SANS data allows us to determine the absolute value of the density of D2O as a function of temperature. We observe a density minimum at 210+-5 K with a value of 1.041+-0.003 g/cm3. We show that the results are consistent with the predictions of molecular dynamics simulations of supercooled bulk water. This is the first experimental report of the existence of the density minimum in supercooled water.
