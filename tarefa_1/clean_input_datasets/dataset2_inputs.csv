D1-1	Cells form the fundamental building blocks of life, underpinning every organism—from towering trees and intricate animals to the smallest microbes. They manage essential processes like metabolism, replication, and energy production, all while dynamically adapting to environmental shifts and collaborating in complex networks to drive growth and maintain balance.
D1-2	It is widely thought that the genome is relatively stable throughout life and remains the same independently of cell type—with the exception of post-meiotic germ cells, vertebrate immune cells, and in pathological conditions such as cancer. However, during the generation of maintenance of the extraordinary number of cells that comprise a complex multicellular organism—in adult humans, the total cell number is estimated to be 38 trillion[14] at any given time, with a substantial ongoing turnover of particular cell lineages.
D1-3	High-throughput single-cell gene expression profiling has been revolutionized by the introduction of microfluidics approaches which enable 3 transcript counting from thousands of cells in parallel. The Drop-seq[49] and Indrop[50] methods introduced this approach, in which individual cells or nuclei[10] are co-encapsulated in droplets with uniquely barcoded oligodT primers, enabling cDNA to be pooled and sequenced in parallel, with reads assigned to individual cells based on their barcode. Droplet-based methods have also been integrated with pooled CRISPR screening approaches to identify gene targets in thousands of single-cells, using panels of guide RNAs.
D1-4	Cells serve as the very foundation of life, orchestrating critical functions such as energy production, growth, and reproduction. They come in a remarkable array of forms—from the simplicity of unicellular bacteria to the complexity of multicellular organisms—and work in unison, communicating and specializing to adapt seamlessly to environmental changes.
D1-5	The metabolome, defined as the full collection of all low molecular-weight metabolites that are produced by a cell, could be a key indicator of cell state—reflecting the precise metabolic activity and condition within the cell.
